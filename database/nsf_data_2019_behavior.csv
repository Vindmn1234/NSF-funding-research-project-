The project will generate new data about Georgian populations that can be utilized by scientific researchers and the general public, thereby expanding the collective knowledge of anthropology, genetics and human history. The project will strengthen substantive international research collaborations with Georgian scholars, provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, contribute to course content for biological anthropology and population genetics courses, and promote public dissemination of the scientific results through publications and lectures in both the United States and Georgia. The results of the study will also be shared with participants by the international research team.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this interdisciplinary study, developed in collaboration with scholars from the Ivane Javakhishvili Institute of History and Ethnology and the Tbilisi State Medical University, the investigators will conduct a survey of genomic diversity in modern Georgian populations, which will reveal new details about human phylogeography, sex-biased contributions to genetic diversity, patterns of admixture and migration, and the modern human settlement of Eurasia. Through fieldwork in the region, the investigators will obtain genealogical data and DNA samples from ~1250 individuals living there. For these newly collected samples, and for ~700 previously collected samples from the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region, they will analyze mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal variation, including through whole genome sequencing. These data will be analyzed in conjunction with archeological, ethnological and linguistic evidence. Using this approach, a number of questions will be addressed, including: (a) the Paleolithic settlement of the Caucasus by modern humans; (b) the nature and extent of Neanderthal admixture in Georgian populations; (c) the degree to which local Caucasus populations have genetically influenced Eurasian populations; (d) the biological and cultural impact of the Neolithic spread of agriculture into the Caucasus; and (e) the interactions between Anatolian and Georgian populations over the past ten millennia. This project will generate some of the highest resolution mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal data currently available for Caucasus populations. Finally, these studies of contemporary Caucasus populations will lay the foundation for future ancient DNA analyses of past human populations from various locations and temporal contexts within the region, ones that will provide a clearer diachronic perspective on genetic variation in the Caucasus itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The investigators will focus on dietary iron, which is vital for life, but also presents hazards, including its availability to pathogens as well as an individual host's own cells. Hosts have evolved multiple mechanisms to withhold iron from infectious agents, and infectious agents, such as bacteria, have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to acquire iron from their hosts, resulting in an evolutionary ""arms race"" over iron. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about this ""arms race"" in a human population with high pathogen load, to understand how diet, iron nutrition, infection risk, and growth and development are related, and how humans may have adapted to high pathogen environments. The research findings may also inform public health efforts to address iron nutrition and deficiency. This international collaboration will include both field and laboratory training opportunities for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including groups under-represented in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates the impact of iron status on immunity and infection among children in a population with high rates of iron deficiency and infectious disease. Over the course of one year, participating children will be evaluated monthly for measures of diet, growth and development, iron intake, immune function and infection. The relative importance of diets as causes of iron deficiency and anemia will be described. The prevalence of impaired cell-mediated immunity and incidence of infectious diseases will be compared across iron status groups. In this manner, this study will work toward disentangling the complex interactions between diet, growth and development, iron nutrition, immunity, and infectious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Such diversity includes both the social position of the worker and type of work they do. The research will examine how diverse workers interact with volunteers in their efforts to reduce poverty. The research will examine the extent to which such interactions influence NGOs to change their project goals, and will examine the new kinds of work these interactions produce. Volunteer tourism is a rapidly expanding transnational phenomenon, and this study will provide insights into how it transforms volunteers who travel abroad, NGO operations, and development project outcomes. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will apply a geographic analysis of transnational voluntourism by shifting the scale of development research from the typical macro level analysis of policies or trade to the micro level, with a focus on people, homes, and offices. The study will use an ethnographic approach to examine how daily work by diverse workers at an NGO shape how such organizations function at multiple scales including institutional, interpersonal, and at the project scale. The research will seek answers to the following questions: (1) what is the relationship between labor dynamics, NGO practices, and funding?; (2) what are the experiences of volunteers, workers, and beneficiaries of NGOs?; and (3) how do the labor dynamics and experiences impact both livelihoods and development outcomes of poverty reduction projects?. The student will collect data through a multi-faceted approach including participant observation, semi-structured and informal interviews; content analysis of annual reports; and post-trip email surveys of volunteers. While this research focuses on development projects in Guatemala, it will provide new insights regarding the impacts of American volunteer tourism on people and development NGOs, with implications for improving volunteer tourism and development practices both in the US and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Irrigation megaprojects in arid landscapes feature prominently in agricultural development worldwide. Planning and policy entities often focus on the economic benefits of irrigation water for farmers. However, irrigated soils are often central to ecological and social conflicts that follow the construction of irrigation districts. Such conflicts include reduced soil quality, water contamination via agricultural runoff, and displacement of regional farmers by investors' large land acquisitions. Therefore, this research will investigate the social and ecological effects of irrigation megaprojects and the related governing policies and practices of irrigation water and soils. This research will contribute to scholarly and policy considerations of social-environmental feedbacks in governance. The broader impacts of this project will (1) work toward improved irrigation infrastructure development, (2) strengthen management of irrigated land to ensure increased sustainability of soil and water resources, and (3) encourage policy that ensures more equitable access to irrigated land. During this research diverse university students will receive training in mixed methods research. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This dissertation investigates the interactions and feedbacks between irrigation megaprojects, soil management practices, and soil and water governance. Scholarship of environmental governance related to irrigation has focused on issues of water access and control. While important, more scholarly attention must examine the centrality of soils within irrigation megaprojects. The coupling of and tensions between water and soil use and governance require detailed empirical examination that leverages key literatures within geography and the spatial sciences, particularly environmental governance, coupled human-environment systems, and feminist political ecology. Three questions guide this research: (1) How does access to water from irrigation megaprojects shape soil management practices, specifically crop selection, crop rotations, and applications of agrochemicals? (2) How do social and environmental stressors inform soil management practices? (3) How do social and environmental stressors feedback into environmental governance? This research employs a mixed methods approach including change detection analysis, environmental archival research, participant observation, a survey, farm transect walks, and semi-structured interviews with farmers, irrigation managers, and government officials. This research project will provide new insights regarding sustainable and equitable approaches to irrigation development and governance in dryland areas in Colombia and elsewhere, including the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019
Andrea,,Berez-Kroeker,andrea.berez@hawaii.edu,University of Hawaii,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,02/15/2019,07/31/2022,17284,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Integration of Quantitative and Documentary Methodologies in the Analysis of a Segmentally-Rich Language,"Much of what we know about how human languages work is based on only a handful of well-studied languages, chiefly from Western, industrialized countries. Meanwhile, nearly half of the world's 7,000 languages are under threat of disappearance, presenting linguistics with the urgent challenge of documenting under-studied languages while communities still use them. This dissertation project addresses these issues not only by documenting an under-studied, segmentally-rich language, but through groundbreaking adaptation of experimental methods to a fieldwork setting to provide rich, quantitative data of the type normally only available for well-studied languages. The researchers will conduct the first quantitatively-driven investigations of the sound system and grammar of Tsova-Tush, a critically endangered Northeast Caucasian language spoken in Georgia. This language family and region are both dramatically underrepresented in linguistics, meaning that quantitative data from this language are particularly valuable for helping to increase the diversity of the database available to linguistic science. Further, its location in Georgia is an ideal fieldwork setting for adapting experimental methods for an endangered language: Tsova-Tush is spoken in a rural, agricultural village with many of the challenges of other fieldwork sites, but with reliable enough access to transit and telecommunications to make the application and troubleshooting of experimental methods feasible. Finally, the documentation will provide valuable data about a segmentally complex language that will further our understanding of the cognitive demands of human language complexity in general. Broader impacts include a public repository of recordings and transcriptions, the training of a doctoral student, and facilitating access to linguistic resources for a minority language group to enhance scientific understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative studies in the dissertation focus on three linguistic questions: the status of long vowels and consonants, the grammaticality of demonstratives and pronouns (indexicals), and the readability of a proposed writing system. It has been suggested that Tsova-Tush has both plain and ""intensive"" consonants, as well as short, long, and ""hyperlong"" vowels, but linguists lack the phonetic details to establish the exact properties of this complicated sound system. Through a detailed acoustic study with multiple speakers, this project will describe the durational properties that distinguish these consonants and vowels. Further, Tsova-Tush has a complex system of indexicals, distinguishing three deictic distances ('here'/'there'/'over there'), whose grammatical uses are poorly understood. In this project, an experiment will be conducted, in which speakers will be asked to judge the grammaticality of sentences with indexicals in a wide variety of contexts, thus establishing the parameters of indexical shift. Finally, based on the findings of these studies, the researchers will test the readability of a proposed Tsova-Tush writing system and provide speakers with linguistically sound recommendations for developing written materials in the language. The dissertation's description of the successes and challenges of the quantitative studies in a documentation scenario will help improve the methodologies of both documentary and experimental linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Prior work with a small sample of only men found that it is possible to predict behavioral performance in such tasks based on the thickness of the cortex in a part of the brain that responds preferentially to faces. Importantly, the manner in which face and non-face recognition abilities were predicted by brain structure was different, with individuals with thicker cortex being better at recognizing vehicles than those with thinner cortex, while individuals with thinner cortex performing better in face recognition tasks. In addition, for faces, only the thickness of the deeper, early developing, layers of the cortex predicted performance. This research will test whether these results replicate in a larger sample of men and women. It will investigate how connections between face-selective cortex and other parts of the brain sensitive to  social interactions could help explain how early experience with faces influences the thickness of deep cortical layers. A better understanding of how the structure of the brain relates to visual abilities could extend predictions to a wide range of occupations such as forensics, medical imaging, and homeland security. The work could also transform how we study cortical development in neurological disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. The project will improve participation of underrepresented middle and high school students from Nashville public schools and increase scientific literacy, via the team's contributions to the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to advance our understanding of how the cortical microstructure of visual areas relates to individual differences in visual abilities. Using ultra-high resolution imaging at 7 Tesla and state-of-the-art psychometric measurement of visual abilities, the project will replicate and extend findings relating visual recognition of faces and objects to the laminar structure of cortex in the fusiform face area (FFA). The project will also test for replication of the relation between one's social network size and the size of the amygdala (AMG), and test whether AMG size mediates the correlation between face recognition and the thickness of FFA's deep layers. The work will generalize prior findings with men to a sample of women, expand behavioral testing to new object categories, and compare laminar effects in FFA to those in other visual areas. Studying the neuromarkers of visual abilities can increase our understanding of brain-behavior relationships beyond already successful domains like general intelligence or health-related behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Yet, Native Americans have been and continue to be dramatically underrepresented in the field of archaeology. The Society for American Archaeology recognizes the benefits of Native American and Indigenous participation in archaeology and has, for the past two decades, developed a Native American Scholarship Fund that supports training Native American and Indigenous archaeologists. These scholarships help ensure that indigenous knowledge and voices continue to become a more vibrant part of the fabric of understanding American culture and past human experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lasting impact of these scholarships has already impacted archaeology and the larger historic preservation community. For example, many of the past recipients of the SAA's Native American Scholarships indicate that their award enabled them to pursue careers in archaeology and in several cases inspired them to create similar opportunities for future generations of indigenous archaeologists to follow in their footsteps. Scholarships awarded through this grant support both graduate and undergraduate education and training in archaeology for Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian students and community members and recipients are selected through a competitive, criteria-based process. The funding provided by the National Science Foundation will enable the SAA to continue their legacy of supporting underrepresented communities within the field of archaeology as part of their commitment to the ""Statement on Diversity,"" which makes inclusiveness an institutional and disciplinary goal. The SAA Native American Scholarship program is among the most visible and tangible mechanisms to show that archaeologists are invested in a future for their discipline that is fully inclusive to Native peoples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The origins to agriculture had a profound impact on all aspects of human sociocultural life. Although research once emphasized single origins of agricultural products, accumulating data increasingly support multiregional models that emphasize local scale processes in the emergence and adoption of agriculture. This project will take an essential next step: the creation of a high-resolution, local-scale reconstruction of the transition to agriculture and the process of plant and animal domestication. Detailed reconstructions of local-scale forager-farmer transition are few, but are necessary to map study how ideas, plants and animals were innovated and transferred across much larger time scales and geographic areas. Although the forager-farmer transition is most often viewed dichotomously as an adoption versus an in situ scenario, Dr. Munro and colleagues will consider information exchange and the movement of plants and animals among localities in Southwest Asia via interaction networks. The project will provide student training and education, foster international collaboration and engage in public outreach. Results will be disseminated to public audiences through a museum exhibit, articles for public audiences, and a series of lectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to the study of agricultural origins by providing, a high-resolution dataset for the Upper Jordan Valley (UJV) of Israel. The UJV provides an especially interesting test case because of its unique ecological conditions created by a large fresh-water system, its low elevation and the accessibility of trade routes through the larger Rift Valley. These conditions also allow investigation of more specific socioeconomic questions about topics such as aquatic resource exploitation and the impact of climatic events like the Younger Dryas. Investigation will center on three Epipaleolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the UJV. These include Jordan River Dureijat and Nahal Ein Gev II which together will provide the first complete Epipaleolithic sequence for the UJV, and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic site of Munhatta. More specifically activities will include: (1) test excavations and sampling at Munhatta. Micromorphological, sediment, isotope and zooarchaeological sampling at this critical site will investigate animal keeping, animal mobility, animal exchange and the importance of cereal grasses; (2) the collection of a comprehensive zooarchaeological database from published Epipaleolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites from the Upper Jordan Valley and more broadly across Southwest Asia to enable a comparative meta-analysis of regional plant and animal domestication pathways, and document the range of methods and measures used to detect the process of animal and plant domestication in adjacent regions; and (3) the collection of zooarchaeological data from Jordan River Dureijat and Nahal Ein Gev II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Human Social-Ecological Dynamics in a Late Holocene Context,"Climate change over the past 11,000 years has had a profound impact on semi-arid and arid rangelands worldwide, with the most severe desiccation accelerating over the last 5,000 years. Human populations which depend on these regions for their livelihood have had to adapt to these changes and learn to manage these landscapes and their food resources over the course of millennia. Archaeology is well-positioned to understand how foragers, farmers, pastoralists, and ranchers have used these dryland resources through time in sustainable or unsustainable ways. The Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia is a yet little-studied region of dryland steppe, which has had at least 40,000 years of human occupation, and a long record of dramatic environmental change. Dr. Arlene Rosen, of the University of Texas at Austin, will lead a team of Mongolian and US archaeologists, and environmental specialists to the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in the southern Mongolian Gobi in order to study the social, economic, and environmental dynamics of human and natural systems during episodes of climate change over the past 5,000 years. The team will include Mongolian archaeologists and students whose heritage derives from a long cultural tradition of rangeland maintenance and use. The project will benefit from the exchange of information between Mongolian and US scientists about traditional herding practices, ecological knowledge, and culture histories, combined with expertise in reconstructing landscape and vegetation histories for the region. The aim is to develop a model for studying dry-land ranges of other regions as well as the Gobi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate how human inhabitants of the Gobi Desert took an active role in altering the desert-steppe environments either with purposeful intent or as a result of unintended consequences of their impact on vegetation and landscapes. It is commonly believed that ancient pastoralists accelerated desertification when they settled in semi-arid environments. However, preliminary evidence from geomorphology and archaeological botany suggests that the first cattle, sheep-goat pastoralist groups to use this region might have improved the sustainability of the area by inadvertently bringing in the seeds of northern steppe grasses along with their herds, thus improving the sustainability of their economic way of life. By excavating sites from these early time periods, the project will expand knowledge of the many ways in which these herder-hunters and later specialized herders were able to maintain their livelihood over the course of thousands of years of increasing climatic desiccation. The excavation of the Burgasny Enger site, in the Ikh Nart Reserve will provide elements of culture history, lifeways, and economic orientation through the analyses of artifacts, settlement structures and plant and animal remains. This will be paired with geomorphological studies of landscape change and water sources in the immediate vicinity of the site. The result will be a holistic picture and roadmap to sustainable practices in dry-land steppe regions of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Current archaeological evidence indicates that humans migrated from northeastern Asia into North America and spread throughout the rest of the Americas.  As part of this research theme, archaeologists are interested in learning about the timing and route that humans initially took to migrate into the Americas.  One main hypothesis on this theme asserts that people used a hunting-gathering-fishing lifeway to spread from northeastern Asia into North America and beyond by initially traveling along the Pacific coastline around the glaciated margins of Alaska and Canada.  If this is true, archaeologists expect that early coastal sites should contain artifacts and the remains of animals that reveal the application of effective technologies used to extract a living from a broad range of marine environmental resources.  Finding archaeological sites that show early North Americans peoples possessed a full mastery of marine environments would add confirmatory evidence to support the Pacific coastal migration hypothesis. The team will generate and share interdisciplinary knowledge about the history of changing coastal environments on Cedros Island and how humans lived in a changing coastal context.  This international collaborative project will generate critical knowledge about the larger issue of the initial human settlement of the Americas and in the process will provide unique educational opportunities for students and the public alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Davis and Des Lauriers will lead a research team to examine how early coastal peoples used fishing and hunting technologies to exploit the full range of Pacific marine resources from nearshore to deep-water offshore biomes.  The research will be conducted on Cedros Island, which is located in northwestern Mexico along the Pacific coast of Baja California.  This island is special because it retains many well preserved archaeological sites clustered around ancient freshwater springs that were undoubtedly attractive places for early peoples to repeatedly settle and in the process create a record of their lives that accumulated over hundreds to thousands of years.  The researchers will lead a team of archaeologists, geoarchaeologists, and environmental scientists to conduct excavations at four sites that are known to contain artifacts and marine animal remains that date earlier than 12,000 calendar years old.  The team will also study local geological records that date to the early period of human occupation in order to better understand the environmental context in which coastal people lived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Historical sources, which are few in number, describe how these communities fought or fled slave raiders, but a key question remains unanswered - how did these strategies transform political, economic, and cultural relations among societies on the edge of the Atlantic world? Archaeology is well-placed to answer this question by examining evidence for changing social relations within and between village communities before, during, and after the rise of the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. Most broadly, this research will cast new light on the historical causes and consequences of a violent social rupture shared by both Africans and the African Diaspora in the Americas. More specifically, it will foster innovative research opportunities for university students and public outreach collaborations with local communities, including the installation of  a museum exhibit at a UNESCO world heritage cultural center in the region. By exploring local responses to global processes over the long-term, this research can also inform forward-looking approaches to US political and economic engagement in rural Africa and other regions on the periphery of the modern world system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gokee and his research team will examine how the Atlantic slave trade impacted social life in a West African ""hatter zone"" - a region where people fought, fled, and/or joined the predatory political economies of neighboring states. Focusing on the Bandafassi region of eastern Senegal, this project will identify the social rules of of inclusion and exclusion that defined who could be enslaved by whom, and under what conditions, over the past several centuries. Researchers will identify these patterns through landscape survey and detailed mapping of past village sites, including riverside locales associated with merchants and militias and highland settlements associated with the people avoiding them. Analyses of the artifacts from these sites, including a microscopic study of pottery, will document how economic processes of production and exchange also shaped the social relations within and between different village communities. The specialized collection and luminescence dating of pottery samples will then reveal how the village societies of Bandafassi did or did not change over time, particularly in response to the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. These methods will generate new data for better modelling how global forces impact local communities in shatter zones past and present, while also providing novel opportunities for public outreach and student education and research in the US and Senegal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This layer is of considerable importance for local weather development and turbulence prediction, yet it is one of the most difficult portions of the atmosphere to sample using conventional measurement technologies. The doctoral student will use small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), a promising technology that has emerged to fill sampling gaps in the ABL and improve the understanding of local weather dynamics. This research will advance knowledge by identifying appropriate spatial sampling scales for temperature and relative humidity variables in the ABL using the new sUAS technology. Working closely with the meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service office in Tulsa, profiles of atmospheric variables captured with the sUAS will be shared in real-time with weather scientists for inclusion in immediate forecast models. Results will also be presented to national and international audiences through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to a better understanding of small-scale turbulence in the ABL, which is of critical importance in meteorology, by analyzing the scales at which these variables are spatially similar (autocorrelated). Building on theories of small scale turbulence along with established spatial analytical methods from geography and the spatial sciences, this research will develop the spatial sampling strategies needed for efficient and effective sampling of scaler variables in the ABL and develop analytical methods for uncovering the processes impacting weather development. Specifically, this research will (1) determine the optimal sampling scales for thermodynamic variables captured with sUAS in the ABL using variogram analysis; (2) investigate the universality of parameters commonly used to identify the size and shape of turbulent structures across a variety of landscape types and atmospheric conditions; (3) share real time data and research findings with meteorologists at the NWS Tulsa office to aid in forecasting and numerical weather prediction. Sampling will be conducted in Oklahoma, a region of the country that frequently experiences severe local storms including tornadoes. The Oklahoma Mesonet is a network of 120 automated meteorological and weather stations that will be used for sensor calibration and validation purposes.

Future experiences never repeat exactly and the world often poses new never-before encountered problems. Therefore, training systems that lead to effective generalization are sought after in both human and machine learning. Extensive experience with many training examples is known to promote generalization but this requires time and a large set of training examples.  There are cases of human learning in which appropriate generalization requires only one or a few examples, or 'few-shot' learning. The human infant begins learns to become a few-shot learner of visual object categories who is able, for example, to appropriately generalize the category 'tractor' after seeing a tractor. This research will determine the learning experiences that teach young children to be few-shot learners of visual object categories with the goal of determining the general principles of training sets that lead to rapid learning and generalization.  These principles will be tested in machine learning models and in experiments with children. General principles of how to design and structure training materials to lead to effective learning and rapid generalization have useful applications in education, in image recognition, and in machine learning. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Most models and theories of category learning concentrate on learning to discriminate categories with training consisting of many examples of many different categories. Despite remarkable advances in computer vision there is a large class of problems that remain unsolved because they require few-shot learning.  Despite extensive research on educational practices, there is a limited understanding of how best to structure material for generalization and knowledge transfer. In becoming few-shot learners of visual object categories, human infants first collect extensive experience with a few individual objects within a few early-learned categories -- their own sippy cup, the family dog, their own shoes and then they progress to becoming rapid few-shot learners of other visual object categories. The core hypothesis tested in the research is that few-shot learning emerges as a generalization of expertise about a very few categories. The research will capture the visual experiences supporting the development of expertise for a few categories using head cameras and head-mounted eye trackers worn by infants. Algorithms from visual science and computer vision will be used to analyze the statistical properties of these visual experiences and of expertise that then generalizes to other visual categories.  Those principles will be tested in behavioral experiments with infants and tested and formalized in modeling experiments using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  The principles offer a solution to the problem of rapid generalization from few examples that is potentially general to any visual learning problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Just as the impression that our visual interpretation of the world around us is robust and complete, our impression of language is similarly rich. Behind the perceived ease of language understanding is a complex set of neuro-cognitive mechanisms that must work in tandem to give us a rich linguistic experience. However, these systems are not always foolproof and can be misled, arriving at unintended interpretations or the perception of ill-formed sentences as if they were well-formed. These errors trigger what are known as ""linguistic illusions"", and just as visual illusions have transformed our understanding of how our visual system interprets the world around us, the systematic study of linguistic illusions can transform our understanding of how we interpret language. Importantly, by studying the conditions under which we do and do not fall for linguistic illusions, we can improve language technologies, provide better language learning instruction, and aid in assessments of cognitive impairments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to better understand the scope and cause of linguistic illusions. Current language processing models assume that illusions are the product of two distinct cognitive systems: one system for fast, efficient communication (the 'parser'), and another, slower system that classifies grammaticality (the 'grammar'). A competing account claims that illusions reflect a single grammar system embedded in a noisy cognitive architecture that creates the opportunity for errors. The current project addresses this debate by extending research to a broader set of linguistic phenomena using behavioral and computational methods to better understand the exact conditions that trigger illusions. This project will inform our understanding of (i) the cognitive architecture of language, (ii) the mental mechanisms for encoding, accessing, and manipulating sentence structures, and (iii) the role of the grammar in sentence processing. The project will have a direct impact on the broader scientific community, the undergraduate researchers funded through project, and the general public. Specifically, the project will expand the pool of participants that are typically included in psycholinguistic studies to non-college students, leading to a more comprehensive study of linguistic abilities across populations, and will bridge research and education by providing meaningful research experiences to undergraduate researchers, including under-represented minorities, through undergraduate training boot camps, research assistantships, and outreach activities at K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

When people move to a new place, they are likely to encounter people who speak with a dialect that differs from their own. In addition, even non-mobile people who live in urban areas are likely to encounter people who have moved to the city from a place with a different dialect. As a result of this geographic mobility, Americans are exposed to substantial variation in regional dialects throughout the lifespan. Some recent research suggests that exposure to different dialects as a result of geographic mobility affects how speech is processed in real time. In particular, greater exposure to dialect variation appears to make people more flexible in their parsing of the speech signal, potentially leading to more successful communication with people who speak unfamiliar dialects. The goal of this project is to understand how this flexibility in processing arises. An investigation of the factors underlying processing flexibility due to geographic mobility will allow for a consideration of how processing dialect variation compares to processing other difficult kinds of speech (such as fast speech, foreign-accented speech, and speech in noise or with an auditory prosthesis such as a cochlear implant), which has substantial implications for understanding the constraints on human flexibility in speech processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine whether the processing flexibility observed among mobile people is limited to the specific dialects to which a listener has been exposed or applies more generally to all unfamiliar dialects. It will also examine how the number of dialects that a person has exposure to and when that exposure occurs (for example, in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood) affects their processing flexibility for both familiar and unfamiliar dialects. Flexibility in speech processing will be examined in a series of speech perception experiments assessing the time course of word recognition and of adaptation to unfamiliar regional dialects. The specificity of the processing mechanism will be assessed by examining speech processing as a function of familiarity with particular regional dialects, such as Northern, Southern, and Mid-Atlantic American English. The effects of the amount and timing of dialect exposure will be assessed by recruiting a large sample of adult participants with a range of residential histories and travel experiences. All of the data collection for the project will be conducted in a language research laboratory that is located within a science museum in central Ohio.

It is also important for occupational success; majorities of both white- and blue-collar workers report using rational numbers in their jobs. Yet, many children struggle with rational numbers even after years of instruction. The goal of this project is to create a theory of children's learning in one area of rational numbers: decimal arithmetic. The project will identify types of knowledge that help children to learn decimal arithmetic more easily, clarify the mechanisms by which this facilitation occurs, and develop a computational model that simulates the process of learning decimal arithmetic. Based on the results, recommendations will be generated for improving children's learning of decimal arithmetic including recommendations (1) to focus classroom and practice time on conceptual approaches that are used by successful learners, (2) to place special emphasis on types of problem that pose difficulty for children, (3) to devote classroom time to illustrating common errors and explaining why they are incorrect, and (4) to use discussion of common errors as an opportunity to illustrate general concepts. These recommendations are anticipated to have implications for improving mathematics instruction in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Learning mathematics involves learning both concepts and procedures. Concepts include principles and relations; procedures are step-by-step action sequences for solving problems. Understanding of concepts is believed to help children learn procedures, but how this occurs is not known. This project aims to create a theory of how conceptual understanding - when present - facilitates learning of procedures within a particularly difficult and important area of math: decimal arithmetic. To accomplish this goal, the project will adopt a three-pronged approach including longitudinal, microgenetic, and computational modeling methods. Longitudinal methods will identify specific types of conceptual knowledge that predict success in learning decimal arithmetic procedures; microgenetic methods will provide evidence for specific mechanisms by which these types of conceptual knowledge facilitate learning; computational modeling will be used to describe these mechanisms precisely and to simulate the empirical phenomena observed using the previous two methods. The computational model will build on and extend a modeling architecture previously employed in a model of fraction arithmetic learning, FARRA; its success will be assessed based on its ability to generate levels of accuracy, patterns of errors, and correlations between conceptual and procedural knowledge similar to those observed among children. The proposed research will advance scientific knowledge in three ways: by connecting individual differences in learning outcomes with a theory of learning processes, by advancing understanding of the relations between conceptual and procedural knowledge, and by extending theories of numerical development into a new domain, decimal arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Are animals also able to use mental imagery to represent their world and experiences? Previous NSF-funded research from the principal investigator has found evidence that rats form mental images of expected absent events. The proposed research builds on this by asking how can rats use mental imagery to reason, and how do imagined events impact new learning? Many creatures face situations in the real world in which the ability to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty would be adaptive. This work can provide insights into how brains think, and how the human mind is unique versus how it is similar to the minds of other animals. This research could inform the design of artificial intelligence systems to learn and make decisions under conditions of incomplete information. Broader educational impacts include the involvement of high-school and college students as research interns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans are rational, causal agents. Blaisdell and his colleagues have recently discovered that, like humans, rats engage in a variety of rational processes involving causality. They make rational causal inferences from their interventions and represent unobservable events, such as a hidden cause, as possibly being present when presented with associated events. That is, they appear to have some form of mental imagery. Rational decision making guided by mental imagery involves the recruitment of the same neural circuits (i.e., the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) that are involved in human reasoning under ambiguous situations, and that requires pattern completion from partial information. This proposal investigates the theoretical and empirical foundations of rational decision making that are integral to human reasoning and their evolutionary antecedents and progenitors by seeking for commonalities in a phylogenetically-distant mammalian relative. Behavioral experiments use operant and Pavlovian conditioning procedures to establish associations between events. Tests of decision making will be made by presenting one of the events and observing behavior when the associated event is uncovered and therefore explicitly absent, or covered by an opaque shield and therefore ambiguously absent. This research will deepen our understanding of the mental capacities of mammalian animals which may offer insights into the likely brain mechanisms involved in reasoning. Mental imagery is a basic process in human learning and memory. Establishing evidence for mental imagery in animal learning and memory can provide insights into which aspects of human cognition are unique to humans, and which aspects of human cognition are homologies shared with nonhuman animals, and could inform the design of artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The Approximate Number System (ANS), a cognitive system which is operational from early infancy onward, allows humans to approximately quantify sets of items without language or symbols. Research suggests that the ANS could potentially support arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, and that the ANS could therefore serve as a bridge to learning formal mathematics. However, the arithmetic capacity of the ANS, and how this capacity develops, is not well understood. This project fills that knowledge gap by systematically examining the computational capacity of the ANS using a series of experiments designed to assess young children before they learn the formal rules of arithmetic in school. The project addresses theoretical debates about the early cognitive architecture of the ANS and its role in arithmetic computation. The project will identify potential ways that educators could leverage children's pre-symbolic mathematical intuitions in order to help them learn formal mathematics. This has implications for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the degree to which computations performed over ANS representations parallel true arithmetic computations.  The development of the computational capacity of the ANS will be examined.  Symbolic arithmetic computation obeys a set of functional rules. For example, the result of an arithmetic computation like 5+6 is a new, independent quantity that is just as precise as the quantities it was derived from, and which can be manipulated and used in further computations. These functional rules make symbolic arithmetic computation both powerful and flexible. This project aims to identify the functional rules of non-symbolic arithmetic with the ANS. In a series of experiments, four to six year-old children will be asked to solve non-symbolic problems with unknown addends (e.g., 5+__=11). This task requires children to perform arithmetic-like computation, holding two separate ANS representations in mind (e.g. approximately five and approximately 11) and performing a computation over them (e.g. subtracting approximately five from approximately 11) to derive a solution. Each experiment is aimed at examining different components of the functional rules of non-symbolic arithmetic, including the representational structure and precision of the solutions to ANS computations and the extent to which these solutions can be used in further computations. Additional measures of working memory capacity, symbolic math performance, and ANS representational precision are used to elucidate contributions of these cognitive systems to the computational capacity and development of the ANS. Data will be analyzed using a combination of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factor analysis, and logistic regression. The project will therefore compliment what is known about the representational structure of the ANS by shedding light on its computational architecture and the development of this architecture in early childhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Paradoxically rivers fix political boundaries yet shift unpredictably across their floodplains, posing problems of jurisdiction and questions of international sovereignty. Additionally, governments manipulated rivers for irrigation, changing river channels so drastically that they no longer adhere to the boundaries they supposedly demarcate. This research examines how rivers have shaped landscapes of belonging and exclusion by focusing on socially differentiated river communities whose shared boundaries shifted when rivers shifted. In response, these communities formed alliances and negotiated conflicts among one another. The doctoral student will evaluate how communities are differentially impacted by contemporary water controversies such as drought and river restoration. Findings will be disseminated to water managers, conservation groups, and the public through publication of written materials in regional outlets and a broadly accessible book. Findings and oral history interviews will be converted into digital narratives to contribute to public debate about the contemporary legacy of past river use and development and can serve as instructional material in classrooms. Results will be shared with the relevant communities. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>Through its focus on the physical manifestation of boundaries, this project will reveal how power has been routed through rivers to shape landscapes of belonging and exclusion for different social communities.

National archival material will demonstrate how river development caused these boundaries to shift, while local archival collections and oral history interviews will demonstrate how these local communities responded in turn.

Understanding how words combine to express new meanings in a predictable (and therefore unlimited) way has been the focus of decades of research, and has led to increasing success by artificial intelligence systems in responding to direct queries, such as asking for directions, weather, etc. However, the meaning of language in face-to-face interactions is influenced by factors beyond just words, and even beyond intonation: nonlinguistic visual information interacts clearly and regularly with speech. For example, when someone says they ""took a note"" while moving their fingers as if they were typing on a keyboard, this conveys that the note was electronic; as another example, a pointing gesture toward someone while saying ""my neighbor"" identifies the person with the label. Technology currently exists to recognize most of these movements, but they are typically ignored for the purpose of meaning since so little is known about how they contribute and compose with other parts of a sentence. A source of valuable insight for this question comes from languages which are entirely visual: sign languages such as American Sign Language have their own full distinct grammar and their own complex rules for the meanings of word combinations, and at the same time clearly and regularly integrate visual demonstrations and pointing into sentence meaning.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project compares the role of visual (demonstrations and pointing) information in gestures used in English with well-documented counterparts in American Sign Language. It builds on current work by the project team in theoretical models of sign language linguistics and gesture, expanding to include state-of-the-art experimental methodologies and analysis. English and American Sign Language will be studied at each point in parallel, both by gathering quantitative data using responses to videos presented online and by analyzing fluent language productions. A major challenge is that research on the compositional processes that underlie how words combine into more complex meanings requires a dolid background in logic and computation, and scholars with this skill set tend to have limited overlap with the Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and fluent signing scholars who have the most insight into the quickly growing fields of sign linguistics and gesture. To correct for this gap, the project will include training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate students and undergraduates whose studies are focused on sign languages and gesture, to provide experience with experimental methodology, statistical analysis, and logic and computation.

This dissertation is a step towards beginning to answer this call. Adult second language learners are often able to function at some level in a foreign language, but the influence of the native language during second language learning and use is known to negatively affect proficiency levels. Second language learners often experience the frustration of trying to remember a recently learned word in a second language, but only being able to retrieve the word in the native language. An important goal, then, is to learn to regulate interference from the native language to achieve higher proficiency in a second language.

While these relationships are firmly established, their mechanisms are not well understood. Aggregated measures of input (e.g., total words) and outcomes (e.g., vocabulary size) track the consequences of multiple years of learning, but this ignores how children acquire language knowledge through iterative encounters with sentences. To observe this process directly, the present project combines high-density input recordings, eye-tracking methods, and computational modeling to isolate the cues that children use to interpret sentences and how strategies vary with input differences. At a scientific level, this research provides a framework for comparing systematic variation across social groups. While existing models of acquisition assume that the convenience sample (i.e., higher-SES children) offers a suitable proxy of learning in all children, this project tests an alternative hypothesis that SES-related differences in input affect what information children attend to when listening to sentences. Isolating between-child differences in comprehension will reveal strategies that learners must acquire to interpret new sentences. At a societal level, learning and communication depend on accurately interpreting sentences. Describing children's comprehension strategies enables better predictions of future outcomes and offers methods for targeting multiple pathways by which early language can affect academic performance. This framework will benefit other populations whose input differs from mainstream peers, e.g., dual language learners, cochlear implant users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the sentence-level processes that mediate between parental input and language outcomes, the present project examines how language experience influences comprehension strategies in 5- and 6-year-olds from varying SES backgrounds. This project tests the hypothesis that input properties regulate what cues are informative for interpreting sentence meanings. For higher-SES groups, greater input quantity supports learning of fine-grained word properties, and increased word diversity enhances the need to access detailed patterns when interpreting sentences. For lower-SES groups, however, decreased quantity and diversity make coarse-grained patterns more useful, both because they require less input to learn and imply similar meanings when words occur in canonical sentence frames. This project measures word-specific and sentence-frame patterns in parental input using high-density recordings of utterances, and distinguishes children's sentence interpretations using eye-tracking experiments. Computational models combine these data to derive child-specific estimates of reliance on fine-grained word knowledge versus coarse-grained frame knowledge during comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

We use memory to find our way around, to detect a familiar face in a crowd, and to keep track of our ideas as we speak and write. One powerful way that memory can affect so many of our behaviors is by helping to guide what we pay attention to. For example, in a messy kitchen, you can use your memory for where mugs are typically stored in order to find one. Therefore, although memory is often studied for its own sake - for example, to understand how we are able to reminisce about the past, or how that process can go wrong - it is also critically important to understand how we can use memory in the service of guiding our attention and actions. The goal of this project is to understand how the functioning of the human brain enables us to use memories of the past to direct our attention, and the consequences that has for how quickly and accurately we can accomplish tasks. In doing so, this work will highlight the critical importance of memory for moment-to-moment attention. This will fill an important gap in scientific research, which often studies attention and memory in isolation. It will highlight the fundamentally interactive nature of our past and current experiences, with implications for how learning and remembering in educational settings can affect attention and future learning in a feedback loop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project therefore seeks to determine the neural mechanisms by which memories guide attention, focusing on the memories stored in a key brain region that is critical for building new memories and retrieving old ones: the hippocampus. This will be accomplished in two Aims, which use multiple methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging, studies of patients with brain lesions, eye tracking, and measures of behavioral accuracy and response times. In Aim 1, the project will determine the neural circuits for memory-guided attention and their relationship to behavior. The main hypothesis is that a brain network including the hippocampus and prefrontal and visual cortices allows us to use memory to update attentional goals and anticipate task-relevant information before it appears. This hypothesis will be tested using a novel approach of characterizing interactions between brain regions (representational connectivity), which&lt;br/&gt;enables investigation of synchrony in information content between regions. In Aim 2, this project will establish how memory and attention jointly guide visual exploration. The main hypothesis is that hippocampal memory retrieval of prior attentional goals will influence visual exploration, attention, and memory in novel situations. This work will have innovative implications for education, e.g., the use of eye tracking to identify if students are remembering and attending to relevant information, even if they cannot&lt;br/&gt;verbally describe it.

Spoken language use reflects many factors, including cognitive constraints on production and perception of sound, speech community membership, and cultural practices, among others. This study models the interrelationships between these factors and participation in regional sound changes or resistance to change, bilectal use of mainstream English together with a heritage language variety used in the local speech community, or monolectal use of an ethnic variety of English. The study site is Washington state. Unlike many places in the United States where ethnic groups settled into small communities with relatively insular social networks (resulting in the famous ethnic enclaves of the East coast and Inland North), the Pacific Northwest has long been characterized by regional and social mobility. The notion of ""community"" itself is complex, but requires better understanding as non-white, mobile individuals become a larger part of the US population. This study also uses practice-based, rather than assignment-based methods for determining ethnic group membership. General practice in the language sciences in North America has been to sample primarily from majority-ethnicity groups in a speech community. The assumption taken has been that non-white speakers do not participate in regional sound changes, but are embedded in separate speech communities defined by shared ethnic identity. While partly true, this assumption has been shown to be a vast oversimplification. There is scholarship showing that speakers' use of ethnolectal forms is not predicted by race as much as by social network composition. But complex social models need to be better-integrated into linguistic research. Race has been conflated with ethnicity, for one thing. Race (physical appearance or genetic heritage), rather than ethnicity (cultural heritage, practice, and perceived affiliation) has been used as an initial tool for constructing research samples, leading to a priori determinations about speech community membership.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes social network measures of localness of affective network, homophily (similarity-based affiliation), network range, and referential network.

Spoken data provide the stimuli for cross-dialect testing of listener sensitivity to fine-grained, time-varying differences in sound. The result is a model of participation in linguistic change relevant for mobile, non-white Pacific Northwest speakers, contributing to sociolinguistic theorization of dialect evolution and interethnic contact, as well as listeners' use of social information in the perception of phonetic variation.

Among the fastest growing of such groups are Asian American and Latinx people. As members of minority groups, Asian American and Latinx people frequently experience discrimination and prejudice.  Many decades of research in the social and behavioral sciences has made significant progress in understanding the nature of such discrimination, its harmful consequences, and how policies and practices can be shaped to reduce those harmful effects. This body of theory and research has helped to develop a much better understanding of the many forms of discrimination, and how racial minorities respond to discrimination. Yet the vast majority of this work is based on the Black-White relationship in the U.S. and the specific experiences of African American people. As a result, the unique forms of discrimination faced by Asian American and Latinx people may be overlooked and poorly recognized by those in power. This is important to understand because policies and practices that are meant to remedy forms of discrimination may actually be harmful to the health and success of some people of color in the U.S. This project seeks to refine basic understanding of discrimination in a way that more fully accounts for the forms of discrimination experienced by Asian American and Latinx people, which can ultimately improve the productivity, health, and welfare for all of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses large-scale audit studies and controlled laboratory experiments to investigate whether racial and ethnic minority groups face different forms of discrimination. The research considers the implications that different forms of discrimination have on the likelihood of reporting discrimination, and how different strategies may be required to reduce discrimination based on which racial and ethnic group is targeted. The project offers a conceptual refinement by distinguishing two dimensions of social stereotypes: perceived inferiority and cultural foreignness. By systematically integrating these two dimensions, new insight will be gained into the distinct forms of discrimination faced by groups who have less-frequently been the focus of theory and research in this area. The research investigates whether Asian American and Latinx people face more discrimination in the labor market than do White and African American people for jobs that require stereotypical American characteristics (e.g., English language abilities). The project also examines whether discrimination based on cultural foreignness is likely to be unrecognized as discrimination by those in power. Experiments also consider unique strategies used by Asian American and Latinx people to cope with these forms of discrimination. Understanding the varying forms of discrimination faced by different racial and ethnic minority groups is a critical step in recognizing, attending to, and eventually eliminating these forms of discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

It has harmful effects on its targets, including disengagement and withdrawal from work and school, decreased performance, and increased anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms that adversely affect health. The effects of sexual harassment extend beyond those personally targeted by these incidents. For example, it can undermine organizational outcomes, leading to a loss of human capital, reduced organizational diversity, lowered productivity and profits, and fiscal damages. To remedy the effects of sexual harassment and lessen these costs requires that people are able to perceive and recognize sexual harassment when it occurs. Yet research shows that sexual harassment is extremely under-reported both by its targets and by others in society. This project explores one important potential barrier that prevents individuals from perceiving sexual harassment. It focuses on people's mental images of womanhood, and how those mental images influence the perception of sexual harassment. The conceptual development of this project compares narrow mental images of traditional womanhood (as White, straight, traditionally feminine) with broader mental images of womanhood that include those who are not White, not straight, or not traditionally feminine. By uncovering ways to broaden the image of who experiences sexual harassment, sexual harassment should be more readily identified. Because identifying sexual harassment is fundamental to its resolution, understanding and addressing the barriers to perceiving sexual harassment is essential to the realization of civil rights as well as to reducing costs to individuals and society that exist when sexual harassment goes undetected.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses laboratory and field methods to investigate the relationship between images people possess about targets of sexual harassment and their images of womanhood. The studies consider whether images of sexual harassment targets overlap with images of traditional womanhood, and whether sexual harassment is more readily perceived by observers and potential targets the more closely women fit with the image of traditional womanhood. A final set of experiments explores whether broadening the image of the types of women who experience sexual harassment increases perceptions of sexual harassment targeting those who do not fit the traditional womanhood image. Participants in the studies include college students, non-student adults, and legal gatekeepers. Traditional womanhood is operationalized along personality dimensions that vary within women and using broader group identities (e.g., race, sexual orientation) that overlap to varying degrees with the traditional image of womanhood. The research will identify a potential barrier that prevents perceptions of sexual harassment, and will suggest low-cost solutions that can remove this barrier. This project will be helpful to scholars and practitioners who address civil rights law, as well as to organizations seeking to address sexual harassment. Evidence concerning best practices will be important in the development of more effective approaches to sexual harassment, ultimately improving workforce diversity and mitigating the deleterious effects of sexual harassment on its targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds lag far behind their more advantaged peers in an essential component of psychological reasoning, false-belief understanding. This is troubling because psychological reasoning is vital for navigating everyday life, and deficits in this skill could have serious negative consequences for the intellectual, social, and moral development of disadvantaged children, as well as their long-term well-being. This project will substantially advance understanding of how and why economic inequality influences children's psychological reasoning. This project thus has significant potential to understand perspective taking processes in children, as well as to improve the developmental outcomes of disadvantaged children. The findings could inform interventions designed to enhance psychological reasoning skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there is considerable evidence for an economic disparity in false-belief understanding, the nature of this disparity is unclear because prior studies have used a single type of paradigm that children could fail for many reasons. To address this issue, a sample of socioeconomically diverse preschool children will complete multiple types of false-belief paradigms that target different facets of false-belief understanding, including several novel paradigms that have not previously been used to examine this disparity. Patterns of associations between socioeconomic status and task performance will be used to characterize the underlying nature of the socioeconomic disparity in false-belief understanding. Few studies have examined the mechanism by which socioeconomic status affects false-belief understanding, and thus little is known about the cause of this disparity. This project will test the hypothesis that this disparity arises via socioeconomic effects on parent-child interactions. Specifically, the researchers predict that less stressed and more knowledgeable parents will use more terms that refer to mental states such as ""think"" and ""know"". Parents' language use will be assessed during several interactive activities with their child. Structural equation modeling will be used to evaluate the proposed pathways from socioeconomic status to false-belief understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

There is evidence that the number of symbols in the written form of a sound can influence how long that sound is produced, even when a written form is not explicitly present. For example, the final /k/ sounds in the English words ""tic"", ""click"", and ""clique"" are represented by 1, 2, and 3 letters, respectively. When people produce these words, the final /k/ of ""click"" is produced longer than than the final /k/ of ""tic"". And the final /k/ of ""clique"" is produced longer still. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that as the complexity of a written form increases, so too does the speech duration of the associated sound, all else being equal. This phenomenon is inconsistent with some models of language production which argue that written information should not influence speech, especially when written information is not explicitly present. Additionally, it remains unclear exactly which types of written information can influence speech duration as there is disagreement about the mechanisms that drive this effect. Some argue the relationship between sounds and written symbols underlie this effect. Others argue the amount of visual information itself regardless of any connection to sounds is driving these duration differences. This study examines the relationship between sounds, symbols, and speech duration to develop our understanding of what types of written information can alter speech patterns. Addressing this question will inform theoretical models of human speech production. Additionally, data collected through this research can be incorporated into computational speech synthesis and speech recognition systems for more accurate, robust, and natural models of human speech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A challenge of previous research in this area was that it relied upon natural speech data which includes many external factors across individuals that can influence speech duration outside of written forms (e.g. word frequency). To gain greater control of these variables, the current study will employ a three-day novel-word-learning experiment in which participants learn sets of novel non-word homophones along with one of several novel writing systems. Novel homophones in a set are learned as the same word phonologically but are written distinctly. Written complexity for homophones may vary by: a) number of whole characters; b) number of pen strokes; c) number of components with phonological associations; d) number of components without phonological associations. Participants will produce learned words in a picture-naming task without written forms explicitly present. Participants' production will be recorded and speech duration will be measured. Duration among homophones in a set and across writing systems will be compared to determine: a) if increased written complexity influences duration even when written forms are not explicitly present; b) which types of written information may influence duration and whether written complexity must have a phonological association to influence speech; and c) at which point in the training process speech patterns change and whether these patterns persist through the end of the experimental period. This data will comprise a portion of the doctoral dissertation. An earlier portion of the dissertation investigated similar durational phenomenon in Japanese speakers in regards to written character complexity. To remain consistent with previous data set, retain the ability to compare results from the current study with earlier data in the dissertation, and provide the opportunity to replicate previous findings in the current study, participants for the current study will be native Japanese speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

One of the reasons for this variable success is prior linguistic experience from different L1s. Moreover, the presence of multilingualism, that many adults will learn several languages over their lifetime, makes it harder to assess prior knowledge. Learning a language means becoming attuned to and developing expectations for systematic linguistic patterns, from sound sequences to grammatical relations. Successfully learning a novel language requires that adults abstract new systematic patterns from the input while using existing ones from their learned language(s). This research will help us understand language prediction and multilingual learning processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research project employs an artificial grammar learning paradigm to investigate how a particular kind of probabilistic systematic pattern, predictive dependencies, in adults' existing tense-aspect system(s) can promote or prevent adaptation to novel tense-aspect regularities. Adult participants from two L1 backgrounds, English and Thai, will learn a miniature language that expresses temporal meaning involving both English- and Thai-analogous predictive dependencies at different levels: between lexical and sub-lexical items (e.g., walk+ed) for English and between lexical items (e.g., a pair of aspect markers such as sed leew [""already completed""]) for Thai. Because the same meaning in the miniature language is equally likely to appear with both sets of dependencies, this research will investigate (1) whether participants are better able to learn predictive dependencies that are consistent with their L1-analogous dependencies and (2) whether the findings will be true under bilingual learning conditions for the English participants, who have perfect knowledge of one set of dependencies and zero knowledge of the other, and under trilingual learning conditions for the Thai-English participants, who have both sets of dependencies available for use during learning but with varying degrees of statistical precision in their L2, English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

As China gains visibility on the world stage, the number of adult (post-puberty) second language learners of Mandarin is growing, as is the number of Mandarin heritage speakers, individuals who were exposed to Mandarin from their parents since birth, but as adults are dominant in English. This project will examine how second language learners and heritage speakers of Mandarin acquire four different linguistic properties of Mandarin. The project will have potential implications for language pedagogy, by identifying problem areas facing learners of Mandarin and providing information about challenges that face heritage speakers vs. traditional classroom learners. Given that Mandarin is a relatively understudied language, this project will increase our understanding of this language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies on heritage Spanish have found heritage speakers to have a selective advantage over second language learners on phonology but not on morphosyntax. The goal of this study is to examine whether such selective advantages hold for Mandarin, one of the hardest languages for English speakers to acquire. This study investigates whether, when both Mandarin proficiency and the dominant language (English) are held constant, early age of acquisition confers an advantage to heritage speakers over second language learners, and whether this depends on the linguistic domain (phonology, morpho-semantics, syntax, and syntax-semantics interface). Three groups (native speakers, heritage speakers and second language learners) will complete three psycholinguistic tasks testing four Mandarin linguistic phenomena: tone sandhi, aspect marking, relative clauses, and long-distance reflexives. These are chosen because (i) they represent different subdomains in linguistics, (ii) they differ regarding the age of acquisition in monolingual children, and (iii) English and Mandarin differ on these phenomena, which is important for both pedagogical and linguistic reasons. The results will contribute to the fields of Chinese linguistics and language acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This process undergoes important development during early childhood, and is shaped by family socioeconomic status (SES). WM, in turn, shapes children's progress in school, and has been shown to mediate the association between SES and academic achievement. Traditional laboratory assessments may fail to capture the complexity of WM behavior and conditions under which WM operates most optimally; thereby, limiting opportunity for evidence-based recommendations for education. In order to address this gap in the literature, the research team will measure the impact of SES on WM development in children 3.5 to 6 years old using parallel computerized and naturalistic play-based settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use a rule-based WM task, where children are instructed to match a door to a house (or a beak to a bird) based on either one (e.g, color) or two (e.g. shape and color) visual feature dimensions. In daily life, WM does not function in isolation, but is paired with motivation to succeed.  Thus, in order to increase the ecological and construct validity of WM assessment in both computerized and play-based testing settings, researchers included three conditions designed to assess how engaging motivational mechanisms impacts WM performance. The Choice condition is identical to the Standard condition, but children choose the houses that they want to play with; the Reward condition is identical to the Standard except the children earn a sticker after correct trials. The Reward+Choice condition combines the Reward and Choice manipulations. A central component of the study involves determining whether the impact of SES on WM is constant across computerized and play-based settings, or whether the impact diminishes as WM tasks increase in ecological and construct validity.  To address this issue, the researchers will collect data on experiences in children's lives that may mirror the computerized and play-based testing environments. SES impact on WM performance in computerized and standard assessments may be mediated by formal instruction opportunities in and outside the home (art or music classes) as well as digital device use and skill. The researchers will also collect data on experiences in children's lives that may support WM development but be independent of SES. For example, individual differences in pretend play engagement may be related to WM performance in play-based settings, independent of SES. These predictions will be tested using structural equation modeling. Findings will provide novel insights regarding optimal WM performance in young children across various levels of SES. Findings will also have implications for shaping early childhood curricula in ways that will benefit children across various levels of SES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Studies have shown that whether and how children defend their victimized peers has a significant impact on the adjustment of victims. Although much research has focused on individual factors and on class-level dynamics of victimization, less is known about the role of teachers. This project will examine the complex ways in which teachers' characteristics, practices, and actions affect (1) students' beliefs and attitudes; (2) the classroom ecology; and (3) victimization and defending behaviors. Future researchers will be able to use these findings to develop teacher training programs. Findings may also facilitate the development of anti-bullying policies and classroom management strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will address the following research questions: What is the association between teaching practices and peer victimization? What is the association between teaching practices and students' desires to defend their victimized peers? How do teaching practices contribute to students' attitudes toward victimization, and are these associations a function of the quality of teacher-student relationships?  Social motivation theoretical models provide an important interpersonal context for socialization by teachers whereas social cognitive theory describes how socialization might contribute to student social cognition and the classroom climate. The researchers will examine reciprocal interactions between teachers and students in fourth and fifth grade classrooms. The project will use a short-term longitudinal design.  Multimethod (e.g., surveys, in-class observations) and multi-informant (teachers, students, trained observers) approaches will be used to gather unique data for multilevel analyses.

This project focuses on the features of Sora's sound system, grammar and vocabulary which stand out in various significant ways, both from related languages and other languages of the region. These analyses will inform (and be informed by) current debates in language contact and language change in the South Asian and Southeast Asian regions, as well as by current work in linguistic typology, and may necessitate a reformulation of the prehistory of South Asia. Sora presents several challenging features, including a possibly unique form of noun incorporation that has been explicitly predicted to be impossible. Once these details of Sora are better understood, and its changes over time have been analyzed, new insights into the murky linguistic pre-history of South Asia will emerge. The project also offers unique opportunities for indigenous scientists to play major roles in the research as key team members, thus offering capacity building and STEM field research opportunities to some of the most underserved and underrepresented communities of scientists. It also helps promote the visibility of indigenous peoples whose histories have been missing from mainstream accounts of regional South Asian history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce A Grammar of Sora (with texts, a comparative lexicon and grammar of the various Sora dialects) and create an exhaustive, annotated archival deposit of the Sora dialect materials. These are to be collected through a combination of spontaneous narrative recordings and targeted elicitation with speakers, recorded in audio and video format. Topics to be explored include the 'expressive' lexicon, which is a highly developed system in Sora with many attested complex reduplication patterns, as well as the systems of grammatical agreement seen in different verb classes. We will also examine the typological shifts that may have accompanied the Dravidian and Aryan migrations into South Asia that marginalized the groups already there, such as the Proto-Munda ancestors to the Sora, and the ancestral language to Kusunda to the periphery.

People develop and maintain a unique set of personal memories and personality traits that define the essence of who they are.  Important lines of psychological theory and research have shown that self-knowledge is distinct from other forms of knowledge.  As an example, self-knowledge is more deeply and tightly stored in memory than other forms of knowledge.  At the same time, it is known that self-knowledge is not rigid or fixed in memory; like other forms of knowledge, it can be malleable and change over time.  An important focus of past research has considered the conditions under which a person's self-knowledge might change.  This project focuses on one such potential condition: the act of thinking about or simulating other people.  This focus recognizes that one's sense of self develops in and is influenced by social life.  A child's sense of self develops partly as a result of imaginary companions and learning how to take the perspective of others.  Comparing ourselves to others is also known to have a strong influence on one's own sense of self.  This project integrates insights from basic memory research, social psychology, and neuroscience to gain insight into how it is that simulating other minds changes the content of self-knowledge.  Because one's self-concept can be a powerful predictor of behaviors and life outcomes, this research offers important practical implications.  One such application concerns the barriers to female participation and advancement in STEM education and occupations.  Relative to their male counterparts, females see fewer successful role models (others) who are ""like them.""  As a result, females have fewer opportunities to accumulate self-knowledge that encourages the valuing and pursuit of a career in STEM.  This project offers a novel solution -- simulating successful others -- that may help diminish this barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis that imagination can change self-knowledge derives naturally from two well-established research literatures.  Social cognition research has found that people retrieve self-knowledge when imagining, or ""simulating,"" how another person is thinking or feeling.  Memory research has found that when information is retrieved, it enters a labile state and can be contaminated with newly presented information.  Together, these two lines of research suggest that when simulating another person, retrieved self-knowledge may become temporarily labile.  In this state, self-knowledge may blend together with information about the other person.  As a result of simulation, self-knowledge may then incorporate information about the person one is simulating.  The outcome is a change in the self to become more similar to the other.  This phenomenon is Simulation-Induced Malleability (SIM).  Preliminary studies offer evidence for SIM: people's personal episodic memories, personality traits, and physical traits become more similar to how they imagined another person's experiences and traits, and these changes are long-lasting.  This project leverages diverse approaches to test specific predictions regarding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie how SIM changes the self.  It also considers the consequences and social applications of SIM.  The research integrates insights from online, in-lab, and longitudinal behavioral methods, along with advanced multivariate neuroimaging techniques, to develop a comprehensive assessment of Simulation-Induced Malleability.  It will inform the longstanding and widespread problem of gender disparities in STEM fields, thereby helping to advance the science of broadening participation.

Indeed, people often abandon their own personal judgments and choices in favor of conforming to a group majority. In some cases, such alignment with the group may protect against social rejection and grant access to shared resources. However, research has shown that people also conform even when there is no social or economic gain for them. One explanation for this result is that the act of reaching consensus with one's group might be valuable in itself -- an idea that is supported by recent neuroscientific research showing that the brain's reward circuit is involved in social conformity. This project combines computational cognitive modeling with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral economic procedures to better understand the subjective value of conforming and dissenting decisions. By uncovering the motivating and reinforcing properties of majority alignment, this research will shed light on a fundamental aspect of organizational, professional and personal interactions. Among the broader impacts is a priority to share data and code to benefit research in cognitive and social neuroscience, to involve the participation of women, underrepresented groups and high school students, and to inform the development of tools that can improve the social competency of impaired individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses model-based cognitive neuroscience to investigate the motivating and reinforcing properties of social conformity. The main approach is to make the desire to conform compete with the prospect of economic gain, and to assess the transfer of conformity-based valence to other features of the environment. A second objective is to investigate how the relative size and perceived competence of a majority opinion influences the value associated with consensus and dissent. A third objective is to explore a common neural representation for conformity and conventional reward.  All of the studies use variations of standard tasks employed in research on economic decision-making. Reinforcement learning models are used to make quantitative predictions about behavioral choices and neural activity.  Model-based fMRI analyses are combined with connectivity and multi-voxel pattern analyses to investigate interactions between social and motivational neural networks, and to explore a distributed overlapping neural code for social and economic currencies.  By formalizing consensus-seeking behavior as reinforcement learning, the project contributes in several ways to the behavioral and neuroscientific literatures on social conformity. In particular, the reinforcement learning framework provides a mechanism for how apparently inconsequential consensus decisions may be motivated by previously acquired valence, and for how that valence may then be transferred to other contextual and interpersonal features. This approach bridges a critical gap, at both neural and behavioral levels, between complex socio-cognitive representations and basic mechanisms of reward-based learning and decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Explicit knowledge is conscious-verbalizable knowledge while implicit knowledge is unconscious knowledge of language that is widely held to be a key component for fluent communicative skills. Understanding how L2 knowledge emerges and what processing activities contribute to it is an important area of L2 research that can inform how languages can best be learned and taught. It will also advance researchers' understanding of the cognitive basis of L2 acquisition and to what extent this basis differs from, or is similar to, first language acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psycholinguists have studied the relationship between and within L2 knowledge and processing for decades, yet the nature of the interface remains unclear. To demystify the interface debate, a large body of international students in the U.S. will complete a battery of five linguistic knowledge tests three times over twelve months. An untimed written grammaticality judgment test (GJT) and metalinguistic knowledge test will serve as measures of explicit knowledge whereas a timed written GJT, oral production task, and elicited imitation will be used to measure implicit knowledge. Students will also report their engagement in the L2 periodically through a mobile app. Using structural equation modeling, the proposed study addresses two research questions: (1) To what extent does explicit knowledge influence the development of implicit knowledge? (2) To what extent do the amount and type of language processing (i.e., grammar-focused and meaning-focused) contribute to the development of different knowledge types?

However, for the roughly 200,000 young children in the US with a visual or hearing disability, language learning proceeds differently, and there are basic questions about the roles of hearing and seeing in language development for which we have no answers. Discovering answers to these questions is critical for supporting individuals with hearing or vision impairments, and those with language delays or deficits, and also for improving the health and educational outcomes of all children.  Children who are deaf or hard of hearing and do not receive sign language input or assistive technology (e.g., cochlear implants) show large delays in acquiring language skills. When such children learn sign language through normal visual modality, though, they appear to develop normal language abilities.  This suggests that vision can provide a ""path"" to language.  At the same time, other evidence indicates that vision is not strictly necessary for learners with normal hearing, as blind adults have largely normal language. Indeed, these individuals learn color and vision-related words (""see"") similarly to sighted peers.  Neurologically, their 'language' brain areas work quite similarly, whereas 'vision' areas reorganize. Unlike deaf infants who receive cochlear implants or sign language input, individuals who are blind do not generally receive (nor appear to require) additional input to support language. This is despite the fact that, in typical development, visual experiences have been linked to language learning (e.g. seeing where parents are looking or pointing).  This project seeks to provide critical evidence concerning how the brain rewires when infants are born unable to hear or to see, and how early brain development enables language acquisition. This project also has two educational objectives that will increase science knowledge among the lay public and schoolchildren, while building the communication, research, and pedagogical skills of tomorrow's scientists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Across five studies, this project will examine the knowledge and processing of language in infants who are blind, deaf/hard of hearing, or typically-developing. Given that infants understand words months before producing them, this work focuses on early word comprehension, particularly on words' sounds and meanings, using behavioral, neural, and observational approaches.  Real-time language processing will be measured by tracking eye movements and brain waves in response to language stimuli. In another studies, word learning will be tracked through the analysis of naturalistic recordings of parent-child interactions. Together, the results of these approaches will provide critical insights into how children learn and grow with the types of language input they receive, as well as how to improve language learning in special populations. The educational component of this project includes a multi-tiered research communication plan, along with a set of after-school enrichment activities for local K-2nd graders.  These activities will focus on teaching students about sensory organs in an engaging, experiential format, with simple demonstrations to facilitate STEM excitement and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Meanwhile, linguistic communication takes place in the face of environmental and cognitive constraints. When multiple options are available to express more or less the same meaning, what general principles govern speaker choice? Advancing our understanding of this question can potentially enhance a broad array of human language technologies, such as providing more human-like language generation with better understanding of speaker choice, more accurate machine translation, better resources for language learning and teaching, as well as insights to improve treatment for language disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this broader research program, this project focuses on the influence of contextual predictability on the encoding of linguistic content manifested by speaker choice in a classifier language. In English, a numeral modifies a noun directly (e.g., three tables). In classifier languages such as Mandarin Chinese, it is obligatory to use a classifier (CL) with the numeral and the noun (e.g., three CL.flat table, three CL.general table). While different nouns are compatible with different specific classifiers, there is a general classifier 'ge' (CL.general) that can be used with most nouns. This study focuses on the alternating options between using the general classifier versus a specific classifier with the same noun where the options are nearly semantically invariant. The use of a more specific classifier would reduce surprisal at the noun, but the use of that more specific classifier may be dispreferred from a production standpoint if accessing the general classifier requires less effort. This project combines corpus analyses, psycholinguistic behavioral experiments and computational modeling using techniques from statistics, natural language processing, and experimental psychology, examining how language users allocate resources to prepare them to produce and comprehend language, shedding lights on why language is structured in the way it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives.

Increasingly, this process is also argued to involve the prediction of upcoming parts of the sentence. However, open questions remain regarding what type of linguistic information is used in order to generate predictions, and to what extent individuals differ in their ability to engage in prediction. This dissertation research project uses electroencephalography (EEG), a brain-imaging technique with millisecond-level timing resolution, to examine whether the brain utilizes predictive cues to anticipate a complex syntactic structure in Mandarin. This study also examines to what extent the ability to predict complex structures depends on verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, providing new insights regarding the neurological basis of language and the cognitive abilities that modulate success in language comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines what type of linguistic information is used to predict upcoming structure during processing, focusing on the prediction of relative clauses in Mandarin (e.g., the string ""Mary wrote"" in ""the book Mary wrote""). In Mandarin, it is only at the end of the phrase that there is any marker indicating that the words form a relative clause; therefore, predicting relative clauses in advance may be critical for processing these sentences without disruption. This project examines whether tense expressions that appear early in a sentence may provide a predictive cue indicating an upcoming relative clause. Brain activity will be recorded via EEG while participants read sentences in Mandarin, in order to track the dynamics of predictive processing throughout the sentence. Participants will also complete a battery of tests in order to examine whether engaging in structure prediction is modulated by individual differences in linguistic and cognitive abilities, shedding light on the individual properties which may affect language comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

A Heritage Language (HL) is a first language (L1) that has become a non-dominant language for its speakers because of its minority status. The question asked in this project is whether a heritage language (HL) behaves like a first language (L1) because an HL is learned as a native language, or if a heritage language (HL) behaves like a second language (L2) because it is underdeveloped like an L2. In order to test this, this study investigates the grammatical and lexical processing in Vietnamese-English bilinguals. Vietnamese, a heritage and minority language in the United States, is the fourth most spoken language outside of English (U. S. Census Bureau, 2015). This shows how prevalent HL speakers are in this country, and yet, there is a limited amount of research conducted on HL processing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Many bilingual language processing models, such as the Bilingual Interactive Activation model (Dijkstra &amp; van Heuven, 2002; van Heuven, Dijkstra, &amp; Grainger, 1998) and the episodic L2 hypothesis (Jiang &amp; Forster, 2001; Witzel &amp; Forster, 2012), were proposed based on evidence from bilinguals with a dominant L1 and less-dominant L2. Little is known about the processing of a non-dominant L1. The first portion of this study examines grammatical processing in HL speakers. A preliminary study compared grammatical processing in HL Vietnamese speakers to L1 Vietnamese-dominant speakers. Findings from this study suggest that HL speakers and L1-dominant speakers decompose L1 Vietnamese compound words in a very similar manner. To further investigate whether an HL is processed like an L1 or an L2, a follow-up study testing morphological decomposition in L2 English is proposed. The second portion of this study examines lexical processing in these speakers. L1 dominant bilinguals have reliably shown that L1 words automatically activate their respective L2 translations. However, it is unclear what happens to bilinguals whose dominant language has switched from their L1 to their L2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

As iconicity is prevalent in sign languages, one might think that deaf children would have an advantage in learning new iconic signs. However, this does not appear to be the case, at least for some iconic signs. For example, depicting constructions (DCs) in sign language are iconic, yet children acquire these signs at a prolonged timescale relative to other signs. This research asks why, and thus has implications for early intervention in deaf children with language delays. There is a great need for sign language tests to assess children's sign language knowledge, and this project can inform the development of these tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depicting constructions (DCs) have non-discrete, gradient properties, which may be difficult for children to understand. One hypothesis is that young learners are biased to interpret all movements within a linguistic system as categorical, resulting in difficulty in interpreting gradient mappings in sign, which leads to errors in DCs. Children might not apply this same linguistic bias to non-linguistic stimuli (such as gesture, which has no linguistic categories) and, and if so, should be able to interpret gradience within gesture. The alternative hypothesis is that young learners can interpret gradient mappings in both sign and gesture, but do not know the phonological constraints on forming DCs and thus overuse gradience, which leads to errors in DCs. This research has three aims: (1) examine the types of errors native signing children form when producing DCs; (2) understand how these learners interpret iconic, gradient movements within linguistic (sign) and non-linguistic domains (e.g., gesture); and (3) understand how specific language experiences shape children's assumptions about gesture and sign by testing children exposed to sign language and those not exposed to sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project investigates interactions of vowels and consonant voicing (such as voiced 'd' versus voiceless 't'). In English, for instance, vowels before voiced consonants (e.g. 'feed') are longer than vowels before voiceless ones (e.g. 'feet'). Despite a long research history, such interactions are still poorly understood. The empirical focus of this project is on two understudied language varieties, Franconian (spoken in parts of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands) and Low German (spoken in Northern Germany). In Franconian, vowel-consonant interactions have led to a tone contrast, comparable to Chinese languages; Low German has developed 'extra-long' vowels alongside long and short vowels, which is exceedingly rare across languages. This project will document and explain these developments, with important implications for linguistic typology and the study of cognitive underpinnings of language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of an empirical, a theoretical, and a typological part. The empirical part investigates how speakers of modern dialects produce and perceive the vowels and consonants. The results form the basis for the theoretical studies.

The typological part of the project relates the empirical and theoretical findings to comparable phenomena in other languages, which will improve our understanding of interactions between vowels and consonant voicing cross-linguistically. The combined empirical, theoretical, and typological studies will help broaden our knowledge of central issues that are at the heart of current debates in the field of phonology, viz. the structure of phonological representations, the interaction of such representations with the production and perception of phonological contrasts (phonetics), and the role of sound change in shaping phonological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

But not all language communities benefit equally. In order to perform well, current language technology requires enormous amounts of data, which are not available for smaller languages and dialects such as Navajo or African American Vernacular English. This requirement stands in stark contrast to the learning needs of children, who do not require much to acquire their native language perfectly. Linguists have attributed the ease of language acquisition to innate learning biases--all languages share universal properties, and a learning algorithm that is aware of these universals requires less data. But linguistic models of language universals are couched in terms that make them hard to incorporate into current learning algorithms. Bridging the gap between linguistic theory and language technology requires a mathematically and computationally grounded understanding of universals, both of which are incorporated in this project to inform language science and language technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a computational model of universals in the domain of sentence structure and how it interacts with the shape of words. It adopts a framework that is built on techniques from theoretical computer science, mathematical logic, and abstract algebra. This makes it possible to characterize universals in a manner that is both rigorous and sufficiently flexible to easily accommodate the rich diversity of languages. The researcher will generalize this formal machinery from sounds to words and sentences. The project draws from from the linguistic literature on universals, and feeds it by deriving new universals from the computational analysis.

Who people love often affects where they live and work, with whom they have and raise children, who they call friends and family, how they spend their time and money, who celebrates their successes, and who supports them in times of need. As a result, the quality of romantic relationships broadly affects physical health, mental health, and financial success. Understanding how people form and maintain these important relationships is central to understanding human social behavior. It is also a clear means of improving human health, happiness, and well being. Yet gaining a deeper understanding of the romantic partner choice process, and the role it plays in human welfare, is one of the great challenges of social and behavioral science. Romantic relationships develop within complex social environments. They are influenced by interactions between individual preferences, competition between romantic rivals, and mutual attractions that change over time. Accounting for such complex and intricate social systems requires assessing multiple, intertwined processes that are difficult to measure and observe. This project approaches the problem by developing a new computer simulation technique. The aim is to apply this technique to accelerate progress in basic understanding of romantic partner choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new technique (""couple simulation"") compares theories of mate selection on their ability to reconstruct actual romantic relationships within computer simulations. Couple simulation will advance progress in mate choice research by providing the first empirical metrics for comparing different models of human mate selection. The method will help address questions such as: (1) what precisely are the decision processes that connect abstract, ideal preferences to real mate choices? (2) how do these early mate choice decisions relate to longer-term relationship quality and dissolution? (3) is it possible to identify those who are likely to have a fulfilling and supportive relationship? In preliminary studies, this technique identifies accurate models of romantic partner choice and predicts romantic relationship quality. This project will further develop couple simulation by combining agent-based modeling with studies of committed romantic couples, of change and stability in romantic relationships over time, and of the dynamics of initial relationship formation. The scientific aim is to produce computational models that more accurately describe romantic partner choice and that can more effectively aid people in forming fulfilling relationships.

Importantly, it is well known that context (such as the presence of irrelevant options) can influence these types of decisions. This can have good or bad consequences. For example, a store's design can influence what products we buy, or how much we spend. This project uses experiments and cognitive modeling to understand how our choices are influenced by context. This knowledge can lead to strategies to improve decision-making (for example, avoiding the traps of advertisers).  This project also promotes STEM education through the development of new materials to teach decision science and cognitive modeling to middle and high school students. In addition, the project supports increasing diversity in the quantitative social sciences through the promotion of gender equality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this project is to advance theoretical understanding of how context influences multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making. This will be accomplished through a joint experimental and computational modeling approach where new experiments provide rich data sets for theory development. Empirically, the proposal will examine a wide range of different types of choice problems across both value-based and perceptual domains. These datasets will (1) provide valuable new knowledge about the general nature of contextual sensitivity and (2) serve as benchmarks for theory testing and development. To date, there are at least a dozen different computational models of context effects in decision-making. The project will first evaluate and compare these theories. The most promising models will be developed further to build more complete theories of contextual sensitivity in multi-alternative choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

New faces may remind us of someone we already know. Smells and tastes can make us think back to earlier times.  More broadly, new stimuli (i.e. sounds, tastes, smells, or sights) can make us think back to something we already know.  When we encounter new problems or information, we often rely upon our prior knowledge to help us solve the new problem or understand the new information. ""Remindings"" are when new information brings back to mind related, prior experienced episodes.  These remindings sometimes happen when we do not want them (e.g., mindwandering) and fail to happen when they would be useful (e.g., neglecting to notice a relationship between a current problem and a previously solved one).  This project will examine why remindings help memory, what makes remindings happen, and how remindings help us to create knowledge that we can use in many situations.  Understanding how remindings operate will show how the mind is structured and how memory works.  Further, this research may show how students can learn new information efficiently and effectively.  Therefore, the project will include high school teachers and help them incorporate research-based practices into their classrooms to support student learning.  Undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will develop their skills as researchers, teachers, and presenters through this research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remindings, stimulus-guided retrievals of past specific episodes, are a fundamental component of cognition that are theorized to underlie a broad array of vital cognitive skills, including problem solving, categorization, frequency judgments, and even number representation.  The nine experiments involved with this project will answer three questions: what cognitive processes underlie remindings, what stimulus characteristics influence whether remindings occur, and what are the consequences of remindings on generalizing category knowledge.  Learners will study lists of related and unrelated paired stimuli, including words, sentences, and declarative concepts.  The relations among studied information and lag between presentations will be experimentally manipulated to affect the amount and consequence of remindings.  Learners' memory for studied stimuli and their ability to transfer their knowledge to new situations will be tested.  Understanding remindings has great theoretical importance, but it also has significant practical importance, as processes underlying remindings can be used to benefit students' memory and generalization across learning materials.  For example, theories of reminding implicate retrieval practice and elaboration processes (both of which boost student learning in authentic settings).  Through presentations, workshops, and education cafes, high school teachers will learn how cognitive processes underlying remindings can impact student learning, and will create lesson plans based around these cognitive processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience. This project will establish new multidisciplinary approaches to tackle such complex problems as climate change adaptation, and train graduate students from the partner institutions and countries in international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vining and his team will examine how prehispanic agriculturalists developed and switched between various productive strategies as the el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) changed in frequency and severity.  The study region, north coastal Peru, hosted a series of civilizations between approximately 2000 BC - 1450 AD, including the Moche, Lambayeque, and Chimu societies.  However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.  The researchers will use this multidisplinary methodological background to improve historic reconstructions of past ENSO variations, record archaeological examples of agricultural technologies in their environmental context, and reconstruct how different strategies were employed as ENSO effected climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

As a result, genetic variation from Neanderthals exists in the human gene pool, but the effects of this variation on human biology are not well understood. In this doctoral dissertation project, the researcher will conduct a large-scale laboratory-based genetic experiment to test whether Neanderthal variants can affect the degree to which a gene is active in human immune cells. By identifying these variants and making publicly available the raw data from this experiment, the researchers will advance knowledge about the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on the immune system of living humans. Given that science news often features stories about Neanderthals, the researchers will utilize popular interest in this area to demonstrate the biological and medical relevance of studying human evolutionary history. They will also work with two museums to develop an exhibit that will additionally highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will help promote women in science given that the research will largely be undertaken by a female graduate student who is committed to training other women in science and has been active in the organization for Graduate Women in Science Engineering at her university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the last two decades have seen great strides in genetic research, because the specific function of most of the human genome is still unknown, researchers face difficulty when trying to connect most specific genetic mutations to their effect on biology. To aid in this discovery, datasets have been produced that allow correlations between the presence of genetic variation and biological phenotypes. However, because genetic variants near each other are often inherited together, it can be difficult to determine which genetic variant is responsible for the biological effect, limiting the ability to truly understand the mechanism. This is especially true in the case of Neanderthal genetic sequences present in living humans, which mostly lay in poorly understood parts of the genome that are thought generally to regulate the expression of genes. Nonetheless, correlational evidence suggests that this Neanderthal genetic variation may be affecting human immune system function. The researchers will conduct an experiment in which they simultaneously test thousands of Neanderthal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in the immune system, in order to isolate the specific Neanderthal genetic variants that affect the biology of the human immune system. This will allow researchers to focus future work on specific functional testing of these important genetic variants.  Furthermore, by directly comparing correlational findings to the results in a laboratory experiment, this research will deepen the understanding of these commonly used genetic datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.

Standard skeletal measurements and landmarks will be collected to allow for comparisons across geographic regions as well as further examination of variation in the size and shape of the face, cranial vault, and birth canal between the sexes and populations. The analyses will account for the potential influence of nonadaptive forces such as drift and migration on body form by pairing skeletal measurements with appropriately matched genetic data and local weather station information for statistical analysis.  Linear mixed effects models testing for evidence of adaptation due to environmental factors will contain both head and body data of male and female individuals from each population.

This striking appearance results from miniaturized body hair and increased sweat gland density (approximately 10 times higher than that of a chimpanzee). These adaptations allow humans to cool their body temperature through increased air flow over the skin and evaporation of water from the skin surface.  This project will find and explain the genomic changes underlying the human-specific evolutionary modifications to hair and sweat gland composition.  The biological insights, as well as the data, methods and tools developed as part of this research program, will provide novel assets to transform the investigation of the genetic bases of other adaptive skin traits and skin physiology more generally.  The data generated by this project also will advance ongoing efforts to build and properly pattern hair and eccrine glands in vitro, a major obstacle in comprehensive human skin regeneration.  In addition, this project will support the training of under-represented minority students and researchers, and fund the development of a public, educational website on human skin evolution, which will highlight outstanding questions in skin evolution and curate ongoing and new discoveries on this topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program builds on the recent discovery by the research team that a subset of biological signals that increase eccrine gland density also alter hair development, leading to diminished hair size. The working hypothesis of this project is that humans have acquired evolutionary mutations in regulatory sequences leading to concomitantly increased eccrine gland density and diminished hair size relative to other primates.  The researchers will (i) map out the regulatory sequences, or enhancers, that control the expression of a key developmental factor, En1, that reciprocally regulates eccrine sweat gland density and hair size; (ii) define the genomic changes within these enhancers that contributed to unique hair and sweat gland traits in humans, by investigating the functional significance of human-specific changes using genome edited mouse models of diverged human and chimpanzee regulatory sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

To date, the vast majority of decision-making research uses relatively simple stimuli to systematically relate independent variables within an experiment to collected dependent variables such as response time, EEG, or fMRI measures. However, the decisions that we make in our everyday lives are significantly more complicated. We exist in environments where resource and reward structures change dynamically on a daily, even momentary, basis. In these environments, cognitive control is necessary to successfully adjust our goals and representations to match the dynamics of our environment. Data from the experiments conducted during this project, as well the analytic methods, will be used to create a comprehensive syllabus in the emerging field of model-based cognitive neuroscience.  The materials, data, and code for performing the analyses will also be made available to the broader scientific community, so that other universities may adopt the course sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive control is essential to successfully adjust our goals and representations to match dynamic changes in the environment. It is argued that our understanding of the mechanisms by which control is carried out in the brain is limited by the lack of statistical methodology to (1) rigorously investigate cognitive models equipped with mechanisms of control, (2) relate mechanisms of control to brain data, and (3) justify the inclusion of complicated mechanisms by assessing model fit and complexity. In this proposal, I hope to use hierarchical (Bayesian) joint modeling techniques to address each of these three limitations. The hierarchical component of this research is specifically designed to assess individual variation in the degree to which cognitive control is executed. The joint modeling component of this research is designed to link neurophysiological measures (e.g., EEG, fMRI) to cognitive theories about how control is executed. Finally, to fully examine the degree to which stochastic mechanisms of control may best describe individual subject data, I will build on existing techniques I have developed for approximating these processes through likelihood-free Bayesian methodology. Each of these components will be used collectively to systematically examine the neural basis of control in various cognitive tasks, and specifically the degree to which individuals are capable of successfully executing said control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In order to understand the influence of behavior and mobility on human bone structure, this doctoral dissertation project will quantify skeletal variation among human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct. This research integrates archaeological evidence of human behavior and microcomputed tomography data to investigate bone structure as an intersection between behavior and biology. Low bone mass related health complications are a prominent expense within the U.S. healthcare system; this project will provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the risk of low bone mass related health issues from an anthropological perspective. The project will also contribute to the development educator workshops for using publicly available 3D image data for classroom-based research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work has found that human groups with higher levels of activity tend to have more robust cortical and trabecular bone structure compared to groups with relatively lower activity levels.

This project investigates the relationship between cortical and trabecular bone structural variation across several post-cranial elements within and between human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct in order to test whether the relationship between behavior and bone structure is maintained, or if other factors such as diet, genetic background, and environment play a larger role in forming adult skeletal phenotype than previously considered. Microcomputed tomography scan data of the humerus, cervical vertebra, femur, tibia, talus, and calcaneus will be collected. Cortical and trabecular bone structural variation will be quantified and compared between groups with different subsistence strategies including foragers, horticulturalists, and intensive agriculturalists.

Tooth enamel from different primate species will be imaged and mechanically tested using methods from materials science engineering to better understand the relationship between the internal structure of teeth and their performance. The results of this study will illustrate the mechanisms that allow teeth to chew tough and hard foods, which may inform research to develop stronger replacements for worn and broken teeth, as well as research to better reconstruct the diet of extinct humans and animals. The study will support graduate student training and the development of undergraduate laboratory coursework that emphasizes the use of concepts from dental biology and anthropology in engineering applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address how the form of enamel contributes to its function in resisting tooth failure. At micro- and nanometer scales, enamel is formed out of many small crystals that are bundled together in complex patterns. These patterns are thought to help teeth resist wear by aligning crystals in a direction where they are strongest in response to abrasion. Additionally, a highly complex pattern of interwoven crystals is believed to help prevent cracks from moving through enamel and leading to a chipped or cracked tooth. This study combines ion beam microscopy to image micro- and nanometer structures of enamel in fine detail, and indentation methods from material science engineering to determine how enamel structures respond when forces are applied. To understand how these structures function in human teeth, the variation in their properties will be compared with those of other closely related species. For this reason, the analytical sample includes teeth from humans and a range of non-human primates including chimpanzees and baboons. Ultimately, this study will strengthen the inferences that can be made when determining diet from fossils in our evolutionary past, and help to illustrate how and why teeth break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The work will address complex relationships among phenotypic norms, social stigma, and co-morbidities of obesity in a vulnerable section of the US population, at a time when there is a high prevalence of obesity, perceived weight stigma, and weight discrimination. Research findings will be shared with study participants as well as curriculum specialists to develop new learning modules. The project supports graduate training for a female, first-generation college student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research employs a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory strategy, using questionnaires, biomarkers, and ethnographic interviews to compare two populations varying in prevalence of obesity: Lawrence County, Indiana (38%) and Monroe County, Indiana (22%). The project is framed around the concept of biological normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. The researchers use this concept to address: 1) how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body are related to statistical biological norms (i.e. obesity prevalence) within a population, and 2) how these normative beliefs influence the statistical distribution of biological traits (i.e. allostatic load) in a population. It is hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed between the two field sites in Indiana will be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load, and that this relationship will be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The project will advance knowledge about hip and shoulder developmental genetics in the context of modern human skeletal evolution. The project will support graduate research and training; 1-2 undergraduates also will have the opportunity to gain lab experience. The co-PI will use her work in a Life Science Outreach program at Harvard University as an opportunity to discuss this research and other facets of human evolution and genetics with New England high school biology teachers and students, ideally recruiting interested students to visit the lab and serve as summer researchers. The PI and co-PI's close ties with the Harvard Museum of Natural History will allow for the development of public exhibits and events that showcase bone biology, genetics, and human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers have discussed a number of evolutionary pressures, primarily related to the adoption of bipedalism, that are likely to have acted on pelvis and scapula morphology during hominin evolution. However, little is known about underlying genomic mechanisms that resulted in the observed changes in the shape and structure of these bones. This project will investigate portions of the genome that were previously identified as having potential activity and regulatory functions during embryonic pelvis and scapula development. The genomic sequences being specifically investigated overlap with regions of DNA that show signs of having been under positive selection in the human lineage. For each of these regulatory sequences, the researchers will test whether the human and chimpanzee versions of the sequence control gene activity, and whether there are differences in gene activity between the two species.

Children's early experiences lay the groundwork for long-term brain development. This is particularly clear in the context of early life stress (ELS), which alters neural circuits involved in learning and self-regulation during adolescence. Identifying biological sequelae that follow ELS exposure and contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes is a pressing scientific priority given that ELS exposure poses significant risks to cognitive and emotional development. The immune system presents itself as a promising biological mechanism by which ELS impacts long-term neurodevelopment because it is highly sensitive to early experiences and has strong bidirectional connections with the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Psychoneuroimmunological Effects of Early Life Stress Study will test for links between ELS exposure, inflammatory processes, and neurodevelopment across a 2-year period in adolescence. This project will use blood samples to assess pro-inflammatory gene expression. It will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the development of two distinct prefrontal-subcortical circuits involved in learning about threats and self-regulation. Longitudinal data will be collected from a group of adopted adolescents who experienced institutional orphanage care as infants--a severe form of ELS--as well as a group of never-institutionalized adolescents. The researcher will test the hypothesis that inflammatory processes promote brain development relevant for learning about threats and disrupt brain development relevant for regulating emotional responses to threats in ELS-exposed adolescents. Pro-inflammatory gene expression will be tested as a mediator between ELS and (a) increased prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during threat learning, and (b) diminished prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during self-regulation. Establishing this stress-immune-brain chain will inform basic models of neurodevelopment and may help explain why ELS deleteriously affects psychosocial and cognitive outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Increasing agricultural production through irrigation is an essential part of the complex solution to global hunger.  Irrigation can make marginal land suitable for agriculture and existing croplands more productive. However, irrigation is limited by its massive use of water.  Determining the potential of irrigation to reduce global hunger requires a thorough understanding of multiple factors such as climate, agricultural water supply, and crop production.  This project will improve predictions of climate impacts on irrigated croplands by advancing the understanding of key constraints on irrigated agricultural productivity. As a result, it will develop strategies for enhancing future irrigation management.  Knowledge, data, and models will be widely disseminated both directly and through collaborations with the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and Kansas Geological Survey.  This project will also increase knowledge of physical geography, climate science, numerical modeling, and data analysis for students at critical STEM stages.  Additionally, the investigator will create a teaching model that enables high-school students to explore the impacts of climate and water resources on crop production, develop an educator professional development course for the teaching model, and provide research experiences for diverse graduate and undergraduate students intending to major in a STEM field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Irrigated agricultural projections that directly simulate the impacts of water supply on yield are few, and typically have simplistic representations of crop growth and irrigation.  This project will address this key deficiency through four main efforts: (1) Construct a modeling framework that connects climate and hydrologic data with a crop model capable of simulating limited automatic irrigation; (2) Evaluate and improve the modeling framework using reported yields and satellite-derived evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and vegetation index data; (3) Force the modeling framework with climate and water supply scenarios; and (4) Explore crop water use and production across irrigation scenarios and modeling assumptions.  These efforts will provide answers to three important questions at the interface of climate, water, and agriculture: (1) What are the effects of water supply shortages on irrigated agricultural production?currently and in the future?  (2) Which irrigation management practices can reduce water use without harming yields, and ultimately decrease the impacts of water scarcity on irrigated crop production?  (3) How can satellite data improve crop model simulations of irrigated agricultural production?  This project will focus on irrigated corn, soybean, rice, and wheat in the United States, where irrigation is responsible for approximately 90% of consumptive water use and $120 billion of agricultural production.

Learning to adapt is especially important for older adults, as it allows them to maintain functional independence (i.e., live independently). For example, as healthcare providers move towards only accessing patients' medical records online, learning to use new online portals would allow an older adult to avoid needing someone else to access personal medical records. The proposed studies with older adults leverage learning theories from infant and child development, when cognitive growth is typical, in contrast to older adulthood, when cognitive growth is thought to be limited. The proposed research tests whether providing older adults with an informative, rich, and encouraging learning environment leads to learning what to learn, and how to learn in new situations (i.e., transfer of learning). This transfer of learning is hypothesized to trigger a cascading effect of new skill learning in daily life to increase cognitive abilities and maintain functional independence.  The broader impacts of the research are twofold. First, this project addresses an urgent need for learning research in older adulthood. According to the US Census Bureau, by 2035 there will be more older adults over age 65 than children under 18 in the US. Most research-based recommendations to maintain cognitive abilities and functional independence primarily include activities that do not prioritize learning explicitly (e.g., physical exercise, healthy diet), despite the need to adapt to a constantly changing environment. The findings from this project could lead to more effective interventions for cognitive and functional gains in adulthood. Second, research-education activities will be undertaken to educate the general public on aging research. In addition to public writing, talks, and video tutorials on aging research, a public symposium will bring together researchers and service providers to enhance communication of research and its application. Mentored research opportunities for older adults, undergraduates, and graduate students, including low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students at UC Riverside, a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution will be made encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research specifically tests the role of frequent and varied (vs. frequent or varied) skill learning in older adults. Research with infants, children, and young adults suggest that frequency and variability may have both unique and combined contributions on learning. In a 12-week pilot intervention, older adults, who engaged in frequent and varied skill learning, similar to an undergraduate course load, increased their cognitive abilities (working memory, cognitive control) to levels similar to those of middle-aged adults, 30 years younger. A no-contact control group exhibited no gains. The proposed research includes a 2-year longitudinal study comparing 12-week frequent AND varied versus frequent OR varied skill learning conditions with follow-up assessments. Analyses will (1) compare the immediate and long-term impact of cognitive abilities, motivation, and learning activities on functional independence and (2) evaluate individual differences in pre-test cognitive abilities and motivation on intervention outcomes. The research-education efforts will open communication channels between older adult communities and researchers and create research opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and older adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project focuses on hot flashes as an aspect of human variation during reproductive aging, and tests the hypothesis that brown adipose tissue - a type of fat that generates heat - may be a factor associated with hot flash experience. The study will extend our knowledge about human variation in both brown adipose tissue and hot flash experience, with particular attention to the relation between hot flashes (subjectively reported and biometrically measured), brown adipose tissue, body composition, and climate.  The study will address human variation in the ability to generate and dissipate heat, and findings will contribute to knowledge about modern human biological adaptations. The outcomes of this research may also inform clinical understanding and treatments of conditions that affect many women in the U.S., including hot flashes and obesity. Results from this study will be shared with participants and communities through public talks, brochures and a project website.  Undergraduate women will assist with the research, thereby gaining valuable experience in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When brown adipose tissue is activated by cool or cold conditions, it creates heat in an effort to keep the body warm.  The central hypothesis of this study is that brown adipose tissue activation may produce enough heat to cause hot flashes.  The  aim is to explore the role of brown adipose tissue activation in the experience of hot flashes among peri-menopausal and early postmenopausal women, aged 45-55, during the cold months -- from late October to early April -- in western Massachusetts.  The investigators hypothesize that (1) women with more brown adipose tissue activity will be more likely to objectively demonstrate and subjectively report hot flashes, (2) brown adipose tissue activity is more likely to be associated with hot flashes in heavier women, and (3) acclimatization to heat and (4) exposure to lower ambient temperatures amplify the association between brown adipose tissue activity and hot flashes.  The study involves face-to-face interviews about hot flashes and factors associated with hot flashes, physical activity, and stress; body measurements (height, weight, skinfolds, waist and hip circumferences); body composition by bioelectrical impedance; an estimation of brown adipose tissue activity with an infrared camera before and after dipping a hand into cool (64oF) water for five minutes; an ambulatory hot flash monitor worn for 24 hours to record both objective and subjective hot flashes; and an Actigraph GT9X watch to measure activity and sleep patterns for the same 24 hours.

Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator, with women often experiencing more severe deficiency. This doctoral dissertation project applies a biocultural perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to investigate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency in both men and women, and for societies undergoing urbanization. The project not only addresses the complex interplay of human biology and culture, but also has the potential to inform public health efforts to understand and address vitamin D deficiency.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological anthropology has elaborated the tradeoffs between the need for vitamin D production and the need to avoid damage from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet rays, but unanswered questions remain regarding how vitamin D is regulated and why some individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  The primary focus has been on sun exposure, but other aspects of the current environment, and aspects of the environment experienced early in life, may be equally important.  This study will use longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, will be tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation - an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression - will be measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. The use of a biocultural anthropological approach allows for an exploration of how lived experience affects vitamin D production and well-being over the life course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Emotions result from making evaluations about the world while considering our future goals, past experiences, and current states. For example, humans have a basic need to connect with others, and emotions such as guilt can provide signals that help guide our behavior to meet these broader social goals by minimizing the negative impact of our actions on others. However, these internal experiences can currently only be subjectively assessed via introspection, which has limited our ability to understand how our brain generates these unique feelings and the overall consistency of these experiences across individuals. Through a series of studies, we will: (a) elicit feelings of guilt in participants tasked with making choices to reduce another person's suffering; (b) develop objective measures of these guilt experiences using computational models of facial expressions and brain activity; and (c) evaluate how these guilt experiences relate to other types of psychological processes such as perceiving guilt in others, remembering past experiences of guilt, and making decisions to harm others. This work has important implications for a number of consequential, emotional, and costly decisions that might impact others in a multitude of domains such as healthcare, politics, and business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal leverages computational techniques to identify objective measures of guilt experiences using brain patterns and facial expressions. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how guilt-aversion is a central motivation in making decisions to minimize harm to others and can be objectively measured by modelling patterns of brain activity. In Aim 2, we use these objective measures to better understand how guilt experiences relate to other types of psychological processes (perceiving, remembering, and imagining guilt). In Aim 3, we will examine if brain signals are uniquely able to capture signatures of guilt, or if these experiences can also be measured using patterns of facial expressions. This work provides a unique interdisciplinary approach to improve our understanding of guilt. First, we demonstrate our ability to successfully elicit guilt using a naturalistic social interaction and identify a common representation in a pattern of brain activity. This will allow us to perform construct validation on this measure to characterize how the experience of guilt relates to other related psychological experiences such as observing others in pain, recalling a previous guilty experience, or making decisions to harm others. Third, this proposal will evaluate whether guilt is uniquely encoded in brain signals, or if it might be manifested in other downstream signals such as patterns of facial expressions. If successful, this work might have a transformative impact on the field of emotion by overcoming the limitations of self-report in studying emotional experiences. This proposal can also provide important insight into evaluating the utility of alternative low-cost measurements to neuroimaging in capturing psychological experiences via facial expressions. Finally, this work could have implications for decision-making more broadly; our preferences for minimizing guilt may be so strong that they overwhelm the other costs associated with decision outcomes.  This proposal also incorporates synergistic educational training and outreach to broaden the work, including a new intensive summer training program; outreach to community service organizations; and new curriculum for undergraduate and medical students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These mechanisms are fundamental for cognition, and dysfunction with some of these processes likely underlie age-related memory deficits over both the short term and the long term. This project will help clarify how information retained in working memory is reactivated in younger and older adults, and how the consolidation of these memories, which are volatile over the short term, may be enhanced with noninvasive brain stimulation over the long term. This project will also build educational and outreach activities, to students and older adults, through community-based learning programs about memory, aging, and the brain. The project will also provide student trainees with a unique set of research skills that will help catapult them towards advanced work in a variety of STEM-related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objective of the research project is to identify the mechanisms that enable the reactivation of information that is passively retained in working memory - that is, information that is not in an individual's current focus of attention, or what is called ""latent working memory."" The hypothesis is that applying noninvasive brain stimulation (specifically, transcranial magnetic stimulation) to sensory (visual) regions of the brain while participants are passively retaining latent information in visual working memory will reactivate stimulus-specific features of the information whereas stimulating regions of frontal-parietal cortex will reactivate the task goals/rules (i.e., which memory the participant is to be attending to at that particular time), and strengthen the consolidation of these memories. The hypotheses will be tested in experiments using new technologies and innovative methods to safely manipulate brain activity and decode memory representations from simultaneously recorded neuroimaging signals using artificial intelligence, machine-learning algorithms. At the conclusion of this project the PI will have shown causal evidence for the roles of frontal, parietal and sensory regions in storing and reactivating latent working memories in both older and young adult humans.

To examine this issue, we will directly record brain activity from subjects performing spatial navigation and memory tasks.  We will measure how the brain supports different aspects of spatial memory by having people perform several different types of navigation paradigms using virtual reality on a laptop computer. Our participants are neurosurgical patients who have electrodes surgically implanted as part of treatment for their epilepsy. These patients volunteer to participate in our experiments, thus providing rare direct human brain data on the neural basis of behavior.  We will analyze the patterns of brain activity to understand how spatial and memory information is represented across the brain, including both local neural signals in individual regions as well as interactions between brain structures. Further, in addition to recording brain activity, we will also apply targeted (and safe) patterns of electrical stimulation to brains during certain parts of these tasks, allowing us to test how behavior varies when selected brain regions are stimulated. The findings from our research will help us to understand fundamental types of brain signals that support spatial navigation and to compare how these signals differ across brain structures.  This project also has a substantial educational component with the development of educational and outreach programs to advance neuroscience education and research at both the K-12 and University levels. We will deploy new curricula on the neuroscience of navigation and memory at New York City schools. To support this outreach, we will develop novel and engaging augmented reality spatial navigation protocols, enabling the students to study spatial memory in their everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to characterize the distinct neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and memory in the human brain, with emphasis on the medial temporal lobe (MTL).  We approach this goal with four key elements: direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients, custom-designed spatial memory tasks using virtual reality, novel computational methods for analyzing local and distributed neural signals related to spatial behavior, and direct brain stimulation for testing the causality of these signals.  The subjects in our study are neurosurgical patients who will perform customized spatial memory tasks that are designed to distinguish neural signals corresponding to spatial and non-spatial memory at different scales.  Our data analyses will identify patterns of brain activity underlying specific memory processes in the MTL as well as various brain regions using both single-neuron spiking and network oscillations. All experimental designs are grounded in our preliminary data, in which we show that the nature of neural responses to spatial vs. non-spatial memory tasks varies fundamentally across hemisphere, with the right MTL supporting navigation and left MTL supporting memory. Furthermore, to identify how information propagates across this network, we will characterize the functional role of a new phenomenon we recently identified, cortical traveling waves, in which oscillations propagate across the brain to coordinate inter-region communication. Finally, we will use electrical stimulation to causally validate our findings. By combining data across these methods, we will obtain a comprehensive view of how spatial memories are represented in various brain areas and distinguish the large-scale brain networks where information propagates to support spatial memory and navigation. The results of these experiments have the potential for evaluating the key theoretical question of whether a single electrophysiological process in the medial temporal lobe supports both spatial and episodic memory or, alternatively, whether separate neural processes and sub-regions in the MTL support distinct aspects of multi-scale navigation and memory behaviors. THis approach involving direct human brain recordings and stimulation is qualified to address this question because the data we will acquire overcomes limitations of both animal electrophysiology and noninvasive neuroimaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Police departments rely increasingly on various policing technologies, including the use of biometric and spatial profiling data. Yet there is little research on the interplay of these policing technologies and their social and geographic impacts on local communities, particularly communities of color. Understanding how these technologies impact children's perceptions of policing, identity, place, and personal security have the potential of improving law enforcement and public well-being. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising young scholar to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will examine perceptions and spatial interactions between police and children from minority groups. Specifically, this research asks, what are the spatial interactions between law-enforcement and children from minority communities, and what are the impacts on children's well-being of those interactions. The doctoral student will use a mixed-method approach to collect data through interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. Children's perceptions and spatial interactions will be understood via the production of visual interpretive materials such as drawings, comics, and mental maps. Findings will be presented in community workshops, community-council meetings and police-community meetings in ways designed to open dialog regarding police policies, practices, and community impacts. This research will provide an analysis of the social and geographic impacts of policing technologies on children from minority groups with implications for informing police, child, and community interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Objects move, information changes, and human observers need to keep updating their representations of that world in order to continue to function effectively. It is obvious that humans lack the capacity to monitor everything continuously but what is the limit? In classic experiments where people have to track subsets of items as they move around a screen, they seem to be able track 3-4 if all items in the display are identical, and just 2-3 if the items are distinct and they also have to track the identities of the items. However, these numbers seem artificially low, and our personal experience is that our visual awareness is much larger. The key reason seems to be that traditional experimental designs do not account for partial knowledge of items' identity and location. We developed the Multiple Object Awareness (MOA) task to measure this partial knowledge. When we include partial knowledge, it turns out that you know something about 8-12 items, not just 2-4. Why do we care? Many real-world tasks involve being able to rapidly find and interact with multiple items in a changing world. Think of a commander, trying to keep track of his squad and his enemies while monitoring the rest of the action around him or first responders, handling an evolving accident scene. Understanding MOA capacity can impact the design of workplaces (e.g. aircraft cockpits). Moreover, training may improve MOA capacity. If this proves to be the case, then MOA could provide a path to improvement on tasks from monitoring multiple streams of information in an operating room to keeping any eye on your 3rd grade class.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The basic MOA tasks, used in this project, are modifications of the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Multiple Identity Tracking (MIT) tasks. Observers monitor a set of moving objects (cartoon animals in our pilot work). The observers are asked to keep track of all of the objects as best they can. Every so often, we cover all items with disks and ask about the location of a specific animal. The crucial innovation is that we ask observers to keep clicking on disks until they find the target animal. As an observer, if you are guessing, you need to click on half the items on average. If you have some idea about the target location, you will need fewer clicks. Based on the number of clicks required, it is possible to derive a MOA capacity estimate of 8-12 items, far greater than MOT or MIT.  Our specific plans are: (1) To screen a large population in order to test the hypothesis that MOA will show a wider natural range of variation than MOT or working memory, (2) to test the hypothesis that MOA is trainable in ways that MOT and working memory are not, and (3) to study MOA in more complex, realistic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems participated in co-funding of the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

For more than 5000 years, indigenous groups created coastal landscapes dominated by such artificial hills built from many tons of shellfish  that left a legacy from which to study social and environmental change over millennia. Archaeology can provide new insights about how and why people built these mounded landscapes where shell was used to build architectural features (pyramids, ridges, walkways, plazas), to create mortuary mounds, and to construct elevated villages. A major challenge in the study of shell mounds is that many have been heavily damaged by the rapid development of coastal areas worldwide. This project will develop and implement new and innovative methods for working with ""legacy"" museum collections recovered from sites before they were destroyed. Researchers will generate new insights about the nature of shell mounds, provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in archaeological and museum methods, and contribute to a public outreach program highlighting the significant cultural heritage of these places. A centerpiece of this project will be the development of a public outreach program about shell mounds in collaboration with local tribes, community members, museums, and city governments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the research team will engender a better understanding of the people who built mounded landscapes using new techniques to highlight their economies, social organizations,  and mortuary/ceremonial practices. The research will involve the fine-grained reanalysis of museum collections recovered from sites now destroyed employing new methods for recovering botanical remains and starch grains, identifying small animal bones using molecular fingerprinting, investigating ""micro"" artifacts, dating materials using state-of-the art techniques, and employing computer-generated mapping approaches.  Research will focus on the shell mounds in the greater San Francisco Bay Area (northern California) where hundreds of sites once dotted the shoreline before their destruction by urban development.  The West Berkeley shell mound, one of the largest and oldest of these mounds, will serve as a test case.  Archaeological materials from the 1950s excavation (before its destruction) now curated in the Phoebe A.

While it is evident that primate crania (skulls) have evolved to accommodate larger brain sizes, the mechanistic underpinnings of these modifications are not fully understood. In this project, the investigators will test long-held assumptions about the mechanical role of brain growth on cranial morphology (shape). Using a novel tissue engineering approach to simulate static tensile loads during brain expansion, the osteogenic (bone producing) potential of calvarial, basicranial and mandibular non-sutural bone cells will be examined in a murine model. The research will advance knowledge about the developmental and cellular underpinnings of cranial morphology, provide comparative mammalian data that will inform studies in primate and hominin evolution, and potentially inform clinical research in regenerative medicine. The project will foster interdisciplinary approaches to research and education involving members of under-represented groups in STEM. It will benefit a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students and undergraduates as well as STEM teachers and students, all of whom will participate in presentations and outreach at public and local institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its location at the interface of neural and facial skulls, elevated flexion of the mammalian cranial base is depicted as the mechanical consequence of an increasingly globular brain. However, most experimental evidence indicates that calvarial bony tissues are largely buffered against variation in mechanical stimuli. In contrast, the dura mater is known to be affected by tensile forces during brain expansion and induces growth of overlying sutural bone. Surprisingly, there is little evidence about the extent to which neural forces and pro-osteogenic signaling by the dura affect the development of non-sutural bone in the cranial base and vault. A major goal of this project is to detail site-specific and age-related variation in the osteogenic potential and mechanosensitivity of connective tissues in the growing skull, using the responses of mandibular bone cells as a baseline to evaluate calvarial and basicranial cells. The investigators will assess if bone formation in the cranial vault and base is affected by pro-osteogenic signaling in the underlying dura mater. This research is transformative in its integrative perspective and novel use of tissue engineering methods. Experimental data on how the dura mater modulates bone formation in the skull is key for understanding important questions, including the adaptive nature of cranial vault thickness and circumorbital form in primates. The presence of site-specific variation in craniomandibular mechanosensitivity would also emphasize that variation in intrinsic mechanisms of bone formation should be incorporated into future work on hard-tissue adaptations in diverse mammals, including cranial and limb elements with more marked bony responses. The project outcomes will therefore contribute to both theoretical and analytical advances in biological anthropology, organismal biology, mechanobiology and pathobiology.

Consequently, most animals living at high altitude have been under strong selection to develop adaptations to these environmental challenges. Identifying adaptations in high-altitude-living animals, including non-human primates, could help illuminate the mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution of many traits. The central goal of this project is to identify these adaptations in a novel non-human primate model, the gelada monkey. The findings will advance our knowledge of how genetic changes lead to high-altitude adaptations in an important primate model system. The project will provide rigorous scientific training at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. The investigators will also engage in public outreach and international research collaborations, contributing to scientific education and conservation efforts both domestically and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an innovative, robust, and multi-disciplinary framework, combining theories and tools from evolutionary biology, genomics, molecular biology, and biological anthropology, to investigate genetic adaptations to high altitude in a non-human primate. The project has two aims: (1) to generate and use a well-annotated gelada genome and regulatory map to identify gene families that have undergone gene expansion and genes under positive selection in gelada monkeys compared to their close phylogenetic relatives, and (2) to identify candidate loci that show signatures of positive selection in high-altitude geladas. The project will identify genes and family expansions whose role in high-altitude adaptations was previously unknown or poorly understood. The project also represents the application of cutting-edge techniques for the sequencing of animal genomes from non-invasive samples, thereby encouraging genomic analyses in wild organisms historically constrained by sample availability. Recent advances in high throughput genomic technologies, including the approaches the PI and co-PI have developed, have allowed researchers to identify genes and loci under selection in captivity and the wild. Together, the results of these studies will generate new hypotheses and predictions for high-altitude and other adaptations in humans and other animals through identification of genetic variants in a novel system. By identifying novel molecular changes that allow a close primate relative to thrive in hypoxic and cold environments, this project may also have translational implications for understanding human diseases of impaired oxygen intake and transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

When exploring a new city, tourists often wander through the streets, with the goal of visiting individual sites and taking in specific views. Through this wandering, they gain an understanding of the network of the city streets. When returning to their hotel, they are unlikely to retrace their steps. They also will not take a straight-line shortcut. Instead, they will draw on what they have learned about their environment to determine a path home using the city streets. How are tourists able to find their way back, based on experience alone, yet unable to determine a straight-line shortcut? This project addresses the challenging problem in the study of human navigation: What is the underlying geometric structure of our navigational knowledge? Is it truly a cognitive map, as is commonly assumed? Is it something coarser and more fluid? We propose that the underlying structure is a graph?a series of connections between places in a network, much like city streets. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test hypotheses about graph knowledge and its properties using walking virtual reality (VR) methods. Outcomes of this research have the potential to impact other fields, including robotics, neuroscience, mathematics, and geography. The interdisciplinary research proposed here will establish a deep understanding of the theory and cognitive mechanisms of spatial orientation, with far-reaching impacts. Greater knowledge of the basic properties of human navigational systems will lead to improved and more effective electronic navigation and GPS systems, self-driving vehicles, emergency response training, and transportation signage. Dr. Chrastil is committed to training the next generation of scientists and increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. As part of this proposal, Dr. Chrastil will develop a workshop on research methods for virtual reality to train researchers on this exciting technique. She actively participates as a teacher and mentor for programs that encourage participation of women and girls in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project specifically tests the hypothesis that the most likely structure of navigational knowledge is a labeled graph, which incorporates local metric information but is not globally consistent across the environment. We have previously conducted an initial test of the idea of a cognitive graph, demonstrating that graph spatial knowledge is used preferentially rather than simply learning routes between locations (Chrastil &amp; Warren, 2014). However, a systematic test of labeled graph knowledge has not been conducted. Little is known about how graph knowledge is constructed during learning or whether labeled graphs are used across all individuals and situations. Here, we propose a framework detailing the theoretical contributors to graph knowledge. We will also test the relationship between graph knowledge and other spatial knowledge taxonomies. In a series of experiments, we will use fully-immersive virtual reality to test hypotheses regarding the nature of spatial knowledge. First, we will characterize the nature of cognitive graphs by pitting labeled graph knowledge against other types of spatial knowledge and testing a primary prediction of labeled graph knowledge. Next, we will test the constraints on labeled graph knowledge, such as generalizability across contexts, its relationship to other taxonomies, and spatial preference. Finally, we will examine the mechanisms of learning labeled graph knowledge, in particular the deployment of attention and active decision making. This research cuts across levels of analysis by contrasting local and global levels of spatial understanding and by pitting labeled graphs against other spatial systems. The results of the proposed work will provide critical insight into the fundamental formation of human spatial knowledge and will contribute to the fields of robotics and neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In many cases, imitation can rely on visual observations of an expert's actions, as when a child learns to use a spoon. Imitation with the voice, used when learning to produce the sounds of an unfamiliar language or when learning to sing a song, poses a different problem because one cannot see many of the movements that are involved. Indeed, many people find vocal imitation difficult. However, because the mechanisms underlying this ability are poorly understood, instructors have few resources with which to help such individuals.  The research program focuses on vocal imitation of pitch, a feature that is central to both music and speech production. The hypothesis guiding these experiments is that formation of a mental image of the to-be-achieved goal mediates and stimulates neural associations between auditory and motor networks that allow the actual production to be accurate. By contrast, a less skilled speaker or singer will not have formed as strong auditory-motor associations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three studies will examine participants imitating pitch patterns associated with song or speech. Spoken pitch samples will be based on English, where pitch is mostly used to convey emphasis, and Mandarin, where pitch is associated with word meanings. Participants in this research will include singers and non-singers, as well as individuals who speak Mandarin and those who do not. Planned studies will 1) assess basic cognitive processes (mental imagery, working memory, and perception) that contribute to imitation accuracy; 2) use electromyography to address whether auditory mental images are associated with sub-vocal muscle movements; and 3) explore the role that specific learning experience has on individuals' capacity to imitate. Results from these studies will be used to improve instruction for learning to speak a tone language and for singing. More effective instructional techniques could enhance the capacity and experience of those learning to speak and sing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Our brains construct incredibly rich perceptual experiences from the rawest of visual inputs: patterns of light on the eye's retina. A major challenge is that the environment presents more information than our visual system can fully process at a time, so we rely on the mechanisms of attention to prioritize the most relevant information. Attention and perception are vital cognitive processes that affect every aspect of our daily functioning. Understanding how these processes typically work - and when we are susceptible to perceptual errors and distortions - has critical repercussions for both the healthy visual system and various disorders, along with broad-reaching applications ranging from maximizing human behavior to development of artificial intelligence and technology. The project's education component will increase STEM opportunities for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, enhance undergraduate education, and offer community outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal outlines a three-year integrated research and education plan addressing how visual feature perception is altered during dynamic spatial attention and distraction. The proposal investigates a fundamental challenge for our visual systems: How do we successfully integrate information about 'what' an object is with 'where' it is? While the binding process is challenging enough on its own, it becomes particularly crucial during dynamic vision and cognition, where there are often multiple objects or locations of interest in the environment and spatial attention is constantly shifting. Using a paradigm recently developed by PI Golomb, we test the hypothesis that unstable spatial attention can cause errors in feature and object perception. In Aim 1, we focus on how visual feature perception might be altered during conditions of distraction, in collaboration with co-PI Leber, an expert in attentional control and distraction. In Aim 2, we expand in an even more fundamental direction, asking how different types of dynamic spatial attention might impact object integration for multi-feature objects. The experiments include a combination of perceptual feature reports, probabilistic mixture modeling, EEG alpha decoding, eye-tracking, and reward-based manipulations. This innovative and novel approach strives to advance our understanding of how we achieve stable and integrated visual perception, especially under conditions of dynamic attention and distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

There are positive effects of social bonds on health, mortality, and reproduction. In this project, the researchers will examine behavioral, demographic and genetic factors that may contribute to the ability of an individual to establish successful social relationships. Focusing on a non-human primate model in which both father and mother provide care to their young, the researchers will study interactions between reproducing pair-bonded adults and solitary non-reproducing ones. This research will contribute to a better understanding of social relationships, including mating and parenting relationships, in pair-living, monogamous groups. The team will train nine undergraduate students, two Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral researcher from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. International collaborations with researchers in Argentina will be strengthened, and the investigators will expand efforts to foster the development of the biological anthropology discipline in Latin America. At the national level, outreach activities will include working with programs involving underrepresented minority high-school and undergraduate students in research (STARS program at the Yale Peabody Museum) and creating a public series of presentations based on their work for topics regularly covered in animal behavior and biological anthropology courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project occurs within the Owl Monkey Project of Argentina, an international research program to advance knowledge and theory about the evolution of pair-bonding, monogamy, and paternal care.

The investigators will study solitary individuals who have left their natal group but have not yet pair-bonded, as well as pair-bonded adults. The solitary individuals need to enter a group to reproduce, which generates intense competition between solitary and pair-bonded adults. Data collected as part of this project will be used to evaluate how competition between solitary floaters and pair-bonded adults influences infant development and survival, natal dispersal patterns, pair-bond formation and stability, and mating patterns. In addition, because this primate species shows very little physical difference between males and females, but intense competition in both sexes, these data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of sex-specific morphologies and behaviors. The project will therefore make theoretical and empirical contributions to a number of concepts that are central to biological anthropology and evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Remembering one thing can remind of us another. This can be a blessing, as when a song transports you back in time to relive a fond memory. Or it can be a curse, as when seeing a colleague reminds you of a missed deadline. Controlling which memories come to mind influences one's well-being. This research will study why certain memories become linked and the processes that allow us to search for specific memories and avoid others. Existing work has often used tasks that simplify real-world memories by having participants only study random words. We will look at how adding real-world complexities to tasks impacts behavior. Another feature of our work is the use of computer models to simulate the cognitive mechanisms hypothesized to underlie memory search. These simulations allow us to evaluate theories of memory. This work will also help educate the next generation of scientists. We will train graduate students in our laboratory and develop a workshop for local high schools. Students will collect and analyze data. This will introduce them to both memory science and computer programing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has two scientific objectives: Objective 1 is to elucidate the computational basis of interactions between time-based and meaning-based associations. Events that occur nearby in time tend to be related by meaning, but typical free-recall tasks lack meaning-based relations between items. Therefore, subjects rely heavily on time-based associations to guide memory search: recalling a word and using it as a cue to recall another that was studied nearby in time. But recent data reveal that subjects all but abandon time-based associations when lists contain strong meaning-based associations. To ascertain how temporal and semantic information interact to guide memory search, our experiments will vary the number and nature of semantic associations in lists. Our simulations will test the hypothesis that such interactions can be explained by representing semantic similarity and temporal proximity in separate layers of a network. Objective 2 is to elucidate the computational principles enabling control processes to change the dynamics of memory encoding and search. We often form new memories without trying and later find that cues bring them spontaneously to mind. Other times, we deliberately encode information which we will need to accomplish some goal. But most laboratory memory tasks are not quite like these situations: subjects deliberately memorize items but only for the sake of rote memory and not for a specific goal. Recent data show that both incidental and goal-directed encoding markedly alter subjects' reliance on time-based associations. This suggests that control processes, which allow the memory system to adapt to different task demands, are critical determinants of how memory is organized. To ascertain how control processes change the balance of time- vs. meaning-based organization during both encoding and retrieval, our experiments will provide subjects with a goal and vary the type of association most relevant to that goal. Our simulations will test the hypothesis that the influence of goals can be accounted for by adding a goal representation layer to the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

But to the contrary, moments of inattention to our surroundings may be essential to the formation of memory. This project will test the hypothesis that even when we seem to be sitting still and doing nothing, the mind and brain are continuously switching between two distinct states - one in which we are focused on processing our immediate external environment (an 'online' state), and another during which we ignore our immediate surroundings and turn our attention toward internally generated activity, including thinking of the past and planning for the future (an 'offline' state). This project tests the hypothesis that the early stages of memory processing occur specifically during moments of this offline state, interspersed throughout our day. By developing new methods of measuring these waking states and their function, this work will help to move us toward a more accurate understanding of wakefulness as an oscillation between distinct processing modes that are essential for the formation and retention of long-term memories. As a part of NSF's RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program, this project will also provide high-quality research training for approximately 12 undergraduate students across the course of 3 years, including members of underrepresented minority groups and students from underserved public high schools in South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of human memory have typically treated wakefulness as a homogenous state. But to the contrary, moment-to-moment alternation between online attention to the current environment and offline attention to internally generated thought and imagery may be a fundamental feature of the waking state, occurring even in the absence of a directed cognitive task. Although we all experience such attentional fluctuations throughout the day, the structure and function of these short bouts of offline time remain almost entirely unknown. The objective of the current project is to model this temporal microstructure of wakefulness in human subjects, assessing the functional relevance of fluctuation between online and offline attentional states to memory processing. The central hypothesis is that the early stages of memory consolidation occur specifically during these offline moments interspersed throughout the day. This hypothesis is based in part on the researcher's preliminary data describing features of these proposed states of wakefulness using simultaneous high-density EEG, pupillometry, behavioral, and subjective report measures. To test the hypotheses, the research team will pursue two specific aims. Aim 1 will model the transition between online and offline waking states at seconds-level temporal resolution, using simultaneous high-density EEG, pupillometry, behavioral, and subjective report measures. Aim 2 will assess the contribution of spontaneous offline time to memory consolidation. Together, these studies will test the novel hypothesis that a fast-timescale alternation between online and offline attentional states is essential for memory consolidation to occur. This work thus challenges the traditional view of wakefulness as a unified state, instead describing wake as an oscillation between statistically discriminable cortical states, each with different cognitive functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We anticipate that this work will lead to two main scientific advances. First, this project will develop a new, data-driven model of the alternation between waking states in human subjects. The classification algorithms to be developed will allow future investigators to more easily and objectively detect and measure offline time, while providing a uniquely comprehensive description of the heterogeneous structure of wakefulness. Second, the project will test the relevance of fluctuation between waking states to memory consolidation, resolving a continued uncertainty in the field of memory research regarding the brain state(s) during which consolidation occurs, and the timescale(s) on which it operates. Finally, as a part of NSF's RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program, this project will also strengthen the undergraduate STEM pipeline in an underserved region of the country, providing high-quality research training to approximately 12 undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented minorities and local high school students in South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Perception Action &amp; Cognition Program, the Cognitive Neuroscience Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The perception of time is fundamental to our conscious experience and critical to virtually all of our activities.  However, despite being a focus of research in experimental psychology since the 19th century, time perception is still incompletely understood. Previous work has suggested that the brain controls the timing of our actions and the motor system simply produces an output in response to these timed brain commands. That is, the brain decides when to move and the motor system produces the movement. However, recent research has shown that the motor system may have a much more critical role in timing and may be fundamentally necessary for the perception of time. The investigators will test this idea by having human participants move a robotic arm that can be perturbed by the experimenters. The investigators will explore whether changing the features of the robotic arm movement also alters the subject's perception of time and whether this paradigm can be used to improve the perception of time. The research program combines aspects of the decision-making and motor planning literatures and will provide novel training for graduate and undergraduate students in the two research areas. Finally, understanding timing and movements is critical to the development of brain-machine interfaces and neural prosthetics and may help support interventions in motor rehabilitation and motor disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most psychological research on time perception in humans, subjects must typically make a choice between two alternatives by pressing a button. This stands in contrast to most animal research, where animals must move to a response location. The investigators intend to bridge the gap between these two literatures with the proposed paradigm. To do this, subjects will be required to move a robotic arm to different locations, depending on their decision about an elapsed interval of time. A series of studies will test the effects of 1) adding resistance to the arm while subjects actively time an interval, 2) actively moving vs. planning a movement while timing an interval, and 3) the impact of moving while judging other, time-critical stimuli (e.g., pitch). In all studies, the investigators will use movement kinematics and dynamics to predict the choices subjects will make and will apply drift-diffusion modeling simulations to elucidate where and how movement parameters impact the perception of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In daily life, for example, a person easily picks up a red apple from a grocery display containing many kinds of fruit. Successful interactions with such complex environments require seamless coordination among multiple mechanisms. In particular, mechanisms of attentional selection that help us make sense of the world work in unity with those that underlie action selection, allowing us to generate adaptive movements. This attention-action synergy is at the root of all complex behavior.  However, researchers typically study these two mechanisms separately, without investigating interactions between them. This practice makes direct comparisons between the findings in attentional selection and action selection impossible. To overcome this gap, the goal of this proposal is to determine the interplay between mechanisms controlling attentional selection and action selection, particularly when recent selection history biases subsequent behavior. It will provide a basis for unifying theories of behavioral mechanisms involved in the selection of attention and action in a global frame. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed project will focus on three understudied aspects of action selection: variation in action execution, effectors, and biomechanical costs, to determine their novel relations with the wealth of research on selection history of perceptual features. To ensure successful outcomes, an international collaboration between the two research teams, who will play complementary and synergistic roles, will be formed between experts in attention and motor control  and computational modeling. This joint endeavor will advance our understanding of the interdependence between attention and action-driven mechanisms to eventually explain adaptive, real-world selection behavior. By including talented undergraduates including nationally selected underrepresented minorities, this proposal also intends to foster the integration of research, STEM and a broad education. Furthermore, outcomes can also contribute to significant technological innovations, including foundation for novel control architecture for robot arms and teleoperators, improving human-computer-interface such as cognitive neural prosthetics and the widely used touch-user-interfaces (e.g. smart phones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded with the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the SBE-UKRI Lead Agency collaborative research opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Species of this group occur more broadly and in larger numbers than any other non-human primate in the fossil record of Africa. Fossils have been found in southern, eastern, and northern Africa, the Middle East, Spain, and even India, an unusual distribution for any primate group besides humans. The living representatives of this group, however, are only found in the highlands of Ethiopia. Because of their overlap with humans in the past, these monkeys have often been suggested as a model for understanding human evolution. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of gelada monkeys will not just provide better insight into the evolution of this group but will also advance the study of human evolution. This project will support graduate student training, and results from the project will be presented to the general public through the American Museum of Natural History Sackler Educational Laboratory's ""Meet the Scientist"" program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to fully understand the evolutionary relationships, taxonomy and paleobiology of the primate genus Theropithecus. All available cranio-dental data for both living and extinct members of this group will be compiled. Morphometric data in the form of 3D landmarks and 2D measurements, as well as morphological data in the form of character states, will be collected. Genetic data will also be collected, thereby resulting in a large, integrated dataset for this primate group. This comprehensive dataset will then be used to: assess the morphological as well as genetic differences among the living populations of Theropithecus gelada; inform research on fossil populations; provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Theropithecus; investigate the dietary trends seen in this genus and their relationship to cranio-dental morphological trends; and investigate the cause of the extreme facial morphology exhibited by some species of this genus and evaluate whether that is related to diet, sexual selection or some other factor.

Second language learning requires significant time to learn material that has not occurred in the individual's prior experience. While this is obvious for foreign language learning, it is less obvious but also true for learning to read. Written and spoken language differ greatly in both their vocabulary and sentence structure, so becoming a fluent reader requires significant reading experience to learn how written language differs from speech. Because poor readers do not engage in this extensive practice, they fall further behind peers who have higher skill. Current instruction methods in both reading and second language learning are inadequate and intervention in both of these areas is in the national interest. Poor literacy is widespread in the US population and is associated with low employment, poor health outcomes, limited participation in society, and higher rates of incarceration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines memory and learning research to investigate how and why speaking during language learning yields not just better speaking skills but also better written and spoken language comprehension than more traditional reading- and listening-focused curricula. The studies rigorously compare second language learning via speaking vs. listening practice, including whether the learning method influences students' motivation to pay attention, practice, and learn. The studies also examine the link between speaking and short-term or working memory, which is the ability to hold information in mind for short durations. Working memory abilities are thought to be an important component of longer-term learning, including vocabulary learning in a native or foreign language. The same methods will be applied to interventions aimed at improving reading comprehension for poor readers with dyslexia or other sources of low literacy, including inadequate instruction, practice, or barriers from low English skills. The interventions will use spoken language exercises that provide practice with the vocabulary and sentence structure patterns of written language, which are essentially ""foreign"" to a reluctant reader. The aim is to provide key learning opportunities that are crucial to developing reading fluency without always requiring reading practice in which poor readers are reluctant to engage. Both the second language and the reading interventions also investigate students' response to various educational interventions, where students who begin with more knowledge generally get greater benefit from additional instruction, leaving behind those who most need the help. If the speaking interventions provide essential background skills, they could help people with dyslexia and other struggling learners learn from the novel interventions tested in this project and position struggling learners to take advantage of existing instruction in current school curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program, the Science of Learning Program, and the EHR Core Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Growing evidence suggests that some early life biological effects, such as those triggered by psychosocial stress, can persist into adulthood and in some cases influence offspring and grandoffspring development. This doctoral research project will use existing survey data, and newly collected data and biological samples, to examine life course and intergenerational effects of early life stress experienced by now young-adult mothers who were exposed to highly adverse social conditions.  The research will advance knowledge about potential biological pathways of multigenerational effects of stress in humans, and contribute more broadly to our understanding of the complex interplay between human biology and culture. The outcomes of this project will contribute valuable data that may inform public health research and policy. The project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers have proposed that there may be multigenerational pathways of biological ""memory"" whereby an individual's biology reflects not only their own experiences and that of their mothers, but potentially also their grandmothers' experiences. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a central component of the body's system of stress response and is among the candidate outcomes likely to be influenced by such multigenerational plasticity. This study provides a unique opportunity to trace the long-term impacts of early life stress exposure to biological and social disparities, focusing on both the physiology and well-being of exposed individuals, and the birth outcomes and stress physiology of their unexposed offspring. This project will utilize existing and newly collected data for a cohort of women, their children, and grandchildren, that has been followed for nearly 30 years and that experienced highly adverse social and environmental conditions. The investigators will first assess long-term effects of the mother's stress experiences during her own early life on her adult biology and well-being, before exploring downstream impacts on her offspring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In the Americas, ancient genomes have revealed new and surprising details, such as the presence of previously unknown populations, previously unsuspected relationships between groups, and new estimates of dates for past events in human history.  Although recent studies have investigated the origins and history of different Native American groups, few have focused on the indigenous peoples of the Aleutian Islands, a population that may prove central to our understanding of human dispersals in the western hemisphere. The analysis of genomes from ancient and contemporary Aleuts will allow us to better understand the origins of these peoples, how they adapted to a challenging environment, and how European contact and recent population events have affected their genetic diversity. This research is supported by Aleut political and cultural leaders, who are interested in using genetic approaches to better understand their people's history. Results from this project will be used in education materials for the participating communities, as well as in initiatives designed to train Native American students in genetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Americas were the last continents to become inhabited by humans, but it has recently become clear that the history of this process was far more complicated than originally understood based on archaeology alone. For example, current archaeological evidence suggests that the Aleutian Islands were peopled approximately 9,000 years ago in a series of population movements from the Alaska Peninsula westward, with groups inhabiting the western islands by about 3,000 years ago. A recently published analysis of genomic-scale data from ancient and contemporary peoples of the Arctic, which includes data from a few ancient individuals from the Eastern Aleutian islands, indicates that the Aleutian gene pool dates to approximately 5,000 years ago, leaving a 4,000 year discrepancy between archaeological and genetic records. One hypothesis to resolve the discrepancy between the genetic and archaeological dates holds that the earliest ancestors of Native Americans - who lived in Beringia approximately 20,000 years ago - may have moved southward to the Alaska Peninsula, eventually peopling the present-day central and western islands. The investigators will test this hypothesis and uncover additional details of the history of the peopling of the Aleutian Islands through the analysis of complete genomes from ancient and contemporary Aleuts. They will also assess the demographic effects of European contact beginning in the 18th century on Aleut populations, and characterize the genetic adaptations of ancient and contemporary Aleuts to the challenging environmental conditions present in the archipelago over time. This research was developed in a partnership between Aleut political and cultural leadership and the researchers at the University of Kansas, which is the result of a decades-long collaboration.

The impact of trauma may be caused by changes to our genome that alter the way in which genes are expressed and proteins are produced. This project will test the hypothesis that violence experienced by a pregnant woman may produce changes in the genomes of the mother, her child, and her grandchild. This study is a global, interdiscriplinary collaboration that will provide a better understanding of how humans adapt to adversity, and how these adaptations may persist far into the future, long after the adverse conditions have ended. The results of this research will be communicated to the public and scientific community through presentations and publications, student exchanges, and outreach activities to local communities and policymakers. This project will train one postdoctoral assistant and 3-4 undergraduate students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, a unique set of biological samples have been collected and will be assayed for changes to the genome, specifically the addition of DNA methyl groups that can change the expression of a gene. Three generation families have been recruited who have been exposed to violence in different generations; specifically, grandmothers in group 1 were exposed while pregnant, mothers in group 2 were exposed while pregnant, and group 3 are control familes who were not exposed. Biological samples from the mothers and two children (one child was exposed in utero and one child will serve as a control) will be analyzed using cutting-edge methods to assay for DNA methylation changes.

The light that reflects from a visible surface toward the point of observation is influenced by several factors. These include the surface shape, the pattern of illumination, and the nature of the surface material. The problem for perceptual theory is to explain how it is possible to tease apart these separate influences in order to make reliable judgments about each one. This project is designed to investigate how this is achieved by human observers. There are many potential benefits of this research. The accurate perception of shape and material properties are important for many basic human functions, such as grasping objects or judging whether visible surfaces are appropriate to afford safe locomotion. A better understanding of these processes may help to facilitate training to avoid injury due to falling. It could also lead to improved 3D visualization in medical devices, or aids for visually impaired individuals that can detect slippery spots or irregular terrain features in the path of locomotion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first specific aim of this proposal is to measure how the perception of 3D shape is influenced by changes in surface material (e.g., glass, wax or plastic) or the pattern of illumination. This will be achieved by measuring local 3D orientation at numerous probe points on an object, from which it possible to compute a best fitting surface that is most consistent with an observer's judgments. The second specific aim is to measure how the perceptual categorization of surface materials is influenced by changes in 3D shape and the pattern of illumination. This will be achieved using a novel categorization task in which observers are shown a shaded object, and are required to adjust a set of sliders to indicate their confidence that the depicted material is one of several possible material categories. The stimuli for these experiments will be created using state-of-the-art computer graphics to produce physically accurate simulations of real materials. The results of this research will greatly improve our current understanding of the specific computational mechanisms by which patterns of image shading provide information for perceiving the 3D shapes of objects and the identification of their material properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project will investigate the local interactions between individuals in a crowd that trigger collective motion and whether the same mechanisms yield collective decisions, such as which 'leaders' to follow.  The results will contribute to a mathematical model of pedestrian and crowd behavior, with the aim of explaining and predicting crowd dynamics in real-world environments.  An interactive crowd simulator will be posted on the Web.  The research has many societal benefits, including applications to evacuation planning, safe building design, real-time monitoring and forecasting of crowd disasters, and the design of social robots. The results will also contribute to research on evacuation behavior and navigation systems for the blind. Moreover, an understanding of human behavior in virtual environments has implications for the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, one of NSF's 'Big Ideas,' as well as for the design of immersive social media.  The project will also contribute to educating the next generation of scientists by training undergraduate and graduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, in experimental research and the use of virtual reality technology and computational modeling methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is generally believed that collective behavior emerges from local interactions between individuals.  Thus, the key to explaining collective motion lies in understanding the rules of engagement that govern these interactions and the neighborhood of interaction over which they operate. There are many different models of collective motion and collective decision-making in fields as disparate as mathematical biology, computer animation, physics, and robotics. However, few of them are based on experimental evidence about the rules that actually govern local interactions and how they generate global patterns of collective motion.  This project tests whether competing models can explain (a) the onset and propagation of collective motion, the crux of self-organization, and (b) collective decision-making by a crowd, such as whether to turn right or left or which subgroup to follow.  In particular, the research will determine the role of leadership in collective decisions and whether strategically positioned leaders can control a crowd's motion.  Researchers will answer these questions using a combination of experiments on 1) a human participant walking in a virtual crowd to decipher the local recruitment and decision rules; 2) agent-based simulations of the data to test competing models; 3) analysis of real crowd data using methods of network reconstruction to determine the causal networks in a crowd; and 4) use of pinning control to predict the influence of leaders (confederates) in real crowd experiments, using large-scale motion capture techniques.  The result of this project will be an empirically-grounded model that accounts for the self-organization of collective motion and the emergence of collective decisions in human crowds, a significant step toward a general kinetic theory of collective behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems participated in co-funding this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Specifically focused on terraced landscapes, the scientists will investigate how key cultural (e.g., population density), ecological (e.g., soil and topography), and climatological (e.g., annual precipitation) factors influence changing patterns of agrarian land use. Previous research has documented discrete systems of terracing in parts of the lowlands, importantly demonstrating that these landscapes were sometimes intensively curated and cultivated. Combining soil science, paleoethnobotany, remote sensing, and archaeology with existing ""big environmental data"" (LiDAR surveys of Above Ground Carbon Storage), the research will investigate these agrarian systems across ecologies and settlement patterns, critically evaluating the resilience of these systems across the Maya lowlands. Are terraces constructed only in response to population pressure? Why are terraces built in particular regions? Why do they endure in certain ecological settings and not in others? Does terracing in the lowlands increase local landscape resilience? Do communities maintain terrace systems once they are built? Throughout the world, questions of landscape resilience, especially related to smallholder agriculture are vitally important to address, so that we can better design, plan, organize and maintain systems that are resilient to cultural and ecological change. This project fosters international collaborations and provides research opportunities for enhancing student engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the long-term landscape impacts of increasing agricultural intensity in the Maya lowlands of southern Mexico. It will inventory and analyze remote sensing (LiDAR) transects extending from the states of Chiapas north to Yucatan and Quintana Roo. Originally collected for environmental purposes as part of the REDD+ carbon inventory of southern Mexico, these surveys offer a uniquely expansive survey of human modified landscapes and landscape resilience. Specifically, it will explore how the form and spatial distribution of Pre-Columbian intensive agricultural modifications of the landscape are influenced by settlement density. The research will also study the influence of local environmental variability on the form and distribution of terracing.

This research addresses basic social and environmental questions regarding the development of early agrarian civilizations, and the social and physical landscapes they engendered and in which modern societies continue to live. Interdisciplinary studies featuring collaboration between archaeologists, geographers and earth scientists are particularly well-suited to apply deep time perspectives to the role of long-term environmental change, and thereby assess competing explanations for early urban collapse, as exemplified in the Southern Levant and witnessed repeatedly elsewhere. Understanding possible trajectories and potential impacts of ancient environmental change holds major implications for understanding how and why the earliest urban civilizations rose and collapsed. Accordingly, this research illuminates the often-precarious relationships between agrarian societies, both ancient and modern, and their ecological settings. This project takes great pride in the training of young female scholars in archaeology and geography. Among the five principal collaborators on this project, four are women, including two early career female assistant professors, one of whom is of Hispanic descent. This project will continue to recruit students from underrepresented groups and provide opportunities that broaden their participation in science through multiple avenues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In close collaboration with their research team, Drs.

This study features a controlled comparative analysis of environmentally-sensitive evidence excavated from four strategically-selected Bronze Age communities along the Jordan Rift: two in the northern Jordan Valley, Jordan and two lying just east of the Dead Sea Basin. Each pair of excavated sites includes a village occupied during urban abandonment (2500-2000 BC) and a village inhabited during the rebirth of cities (2000-1600 BC). &lt;br/&gt;Fine-grained radiocarbon dating of carbonized seeds will provide high precision chronologies for these sites. Coordinated analyses of stable isotopes from crop seeds, and animal bones and teeth will be used to estimate ancient rainfall and temperatures through time.

The analytical results from our four sites will be compared to infer trends of environmental change, both chronologically and geographically. Resulting trajectories of environmental change between 2500 and 1600 BC will be used to assess competing hypotheses to explain Levantine urban collapse. In sum, this research will contribute to the growing discussion of environmental dynamics at the heart of ancient social change with timely pertinence for human responses to environmental change in the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The reason these features evolved is uncertain, however, they are thought to have helped the ancestors of apes and humans to search for food in trees. This project will examine ape locomotion in differing environments in the wild, including forests, woodlands and grasslands, and while feeding on a variety of foods, to determine the circumstances during which distinctive anatomical features are used while foraging. The findings of this study will help to determine why apes and humans evolved features such as an upright torso and mobile shoulders, arms and hands. This project will support the education of women and underrepresented groups at all levels of education - elementary through graduate school - through students' direct involvement in the creation of science education material. The outreach in this project creates cross-cultural connections and increases the quality of science education. Students in the U.S. and at the international research site will help create science education outreach materials and contribute research and conservation virtual content for a National Museum exhibit on ape and human evolution. Scientific findings will be shared through article publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at professional meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hominoids are distinguished by an upright torso and versatile locomotion. It is hypothesized that such versatility evolved to feed on ripe fruit in the forest canopy, since that is what living apes tend to do.  However, recent fossil discoveries show that the earliest apes to display advanced anatomical features, such as an upright torso, fed on leaves and fruit in a partially open environment. To determine how locomotor versatility relates to foraging behavior, the living ape with the broadest habitat preference, the chimpanzee, will be studied. The central question of this research is: How does variation in arboreal habitat structure, and variation in food type and location, correlate with arboreal positional behavior in woodland and forest chimpanzees?  This question will be addressed using video capture and observational data on chimpanzee positional behavior in different habitats. Linear models will be employed on observational data to explore the relationship between positional modes and contextual variables. Kinematic data will be extracted from limb excursions in video footage and analyzed to determine if positional performance is correlated with ecological and individual variables, and whether excursions are greatest for those behaviors that rely on the advanced anatomical features of interest.  Studying chimpanzee movement in multiple contexts and habitats will assist in predicting why hominoids evolved innovative positional behaviors and why early hominins transitioned to a less arboreal existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Deprived of the limb's sensory feedback, roughly 80% of amputees experience intense, mysterious phantom limb pain. Scientists are developing brain-controlled prosthetics that enable patients to move their prosthetic limbs through thought, while also receiving sensory feedback (touch) from the environment back into the body. Yet touch, pain, and sensation are difficult to quantify, deeply subjective experiences, requiring a delicate process of communication, collaboration, and translation among patients, scientists, and engineers. How do patients' sensory experience, their sense of being in a body in space, and their awareness of their phantom limb, influence the development of such biotechnologies? How do patients actively participate, and even intervene, in the design of human-machine interfaces? These are the questions addressed in this project, to inform the development of biotechnologies. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project will broadly disseminate its data and findings to aid organizations in developing more effective biotechnology design and clinical practice to improve the lives of disabled individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate student, Alexandra Middleton, under the supervision of Dr. Joao Biehl of Princeton University, will investigate the role of patients as simultaneously experimental subjects and active co-innovators in human-machine interface design. To understand how the brain-machine interface is engineered, the project examines the role of patient experience and feedback in the development of biotechnology. This ethnographic research will be conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, a global epicenter of engineering brain-machine interface prosthetic technologies. The researcher will follow two clinical trials, accompanying patients as they engage with experimental neuroprosthetics in the laboratory, clinic, and their homes. These devices are the first in the world of their kind to travel outside the laboratory for home use in everyday life. Ethnographic focus will be placed on the home as a key site of science-in-the-making. Through participant observation in patients' homes and interviews with both patients and family members, the researcher will investigate how everyday experiences constitute a particular type of expertise about the use and possibilities of these devices. Circling back to the clinic and laboratory, the researcher will trace how these forms of expertise inform decisions in design as well as therapeutic communication. Archival research will examine the particular economic and social contexts that make such experimentation and development possible. Findings from this research will offer insight into the ways that human perspective and technology use can inform laboratory development and clinical communication, as well as highlighting the importance of involving disabled individuals in the design of technologies aimed at enhancing their lives.

This question identifies a key challenge in the field of memory research: translating cognitive neuroscience findings from the laboratory into strategies that are useful in the real-world. Although memory researchers have identified a set of well-accepted findings and strategies for memory success (for example: elaboration, pattern separation, and transfer-appropriate processing), these strategies have rarely been integrated or even contrasted with one another. By doing so in the current project, we may be able to identify common principles of memory function that translate to real-world learning and memory. We expect that these common principles will increase our understanding of how the brain codes memories and will reveal additional strategies that can be used to improve learning. The ideas from this project will be translated into strategies that will be taught to students entering college. This outreach program will increase student confidence and success and is intended to improve educational outcomes relative to higher education costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well-established principles, including transfer-appropriate processing, encoding specificity, and elaboration, are known to produce benefits to long-term memory in the laboratory. However, we do not yet know: 1) how these principles relate to one another or to hippocampal memory representations and 2) how these principles can be translated into real-world implications. The first question is of great theoretical and scientific significance and must be answered for our understanding of long-term episodic memory to advance, whereas the second is of great educational and societal significance and must be answered to improve our educational systems. The current project develops a unified account of the role of context in episodic memory, addressing both questions. This account proposes that elaboration, transfer-appropriate processing, and pattern separation (via hippocampal coding) have cognitive and neural mechanisms in common whose identification will both transform our understanding of long-term memory and lead to new strategies for learning. The objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of transfer-appropriate processing from a new perspective: as it relates to context and hippocampal activation patterns, 2) test the prediction, derived from cognitive studies of elaborative rehearsal, that variability in context and hippocampal activation patterns improves retrieval, and 3) test the prediction, derived from animal studies of the hippocampus, that pattern separation of similar events increases context resolution and cue specificity. The ideas in this project, along with existing findings, will be taught to incoming university students who are the first in their family to attend college or who are from underserved populations and may not previously have been taught effective strategies for independent learning. The goal of this outreach is to increase confidence and success in college for these students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project develops computational predictive models of how the human brain encodes speech, using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients to validate these models. The outcome of this project is immediately applicable to understanding communication disorders and to the development of neural prosthetic systems that aim to dramatically improve life for large patient populations with disordered speech function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defining the basic neural mechanisms supporting speech comprehension is a fundamental challenge for clinical insights into communication disorders such as aphasia or dyslexia. Better understanding of the neural basis of speech may also enable development of neural prosthetic devices for disabling neurological disorders affecting communication ability (e.g., ALS or stroke). Humans fluidly understand speech despite large variations in speakers and environmental conditions, such as speaker identity, rate, and background noise, but the underlying neural representations that support this invariant speech recognition ability are unknown. We will establish and test computational models of the invariant neural representations used by the human auditory system to achieve reliable speech comprehension. An important application of this knowledge is the development of robust neural decoding algorithms that can be used in neural prosthetic systems designed to restore conversational speech to individuals with disabling language disorders. To achieve these goals, this project will investigate intracranial responses to speech measured with high density electrode arrays implanted in the auditory cortex of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures. The first aim will investigate neural encoding of invariant speech representations believed to comprise key organizational units of spoken language, including phonetic and syllable structure. The second aim develops a novel machine learning framework to build decoding models directly from neural data recorded during intended silent (imagined) speech. This research program will provide new quantitative tools to understand neural mechanisms of speech comprehension and imagery in the human brain with a goal to advance application of these findings toward development of neural interfaces to restore natural speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Globally, multilateral organizations, nation states, non-governmental organizations, and local-level kitchens support a variety of food assistance programs. The goals of these programs vary widely. Some provide livelihood opportunities, including direct cash or voucher transfers; others focus on emergency food aid or even enhancing the nutritional value of crops and processed foods. But whatever their goals, the foundations of such program are often shaky. Dependent on mixed-source funding and volunteer labor, they frequently taper off or close completely, leaving behind questions about why they arose in the first place, why they are unstable, and what the consequences of their demise might be for households and communities. The research supported by this award addresses these questions through the lens of intensive study of a network of volunteer meal provisioning establishments in a context of economic shift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by University of Arizona anthropology doctoral student Sarah Renkert, with supervision from sociocultural anthropologist, Dr. Maribel Alvarez. The researcher has located a site in a neighborhood of Lima, Peru, appropriate for the project because it has experienced exactly the sort of change that needs investigation: the unwinding of a formerly robust volunteer system of local-level food provisioning. This particular food system was based on communal kitchens, staffed by female volunteers who provided a government-subsidized hot meal to food insecure residents. These kitchens have been closing in recent years so the researcher has the opportunity to study the entire cycle: the system's rise; the kitchens that remain; and the effects, if any, of the changes on household wellbeing. The researcher will collect data with a combination of social science methods including participant observation; semi-structured interviews with current and former volunteers, clients, and supporting institutions; archival research on the system's history in relation to shifts in the local economy; and a household food security survey. These data will document the system's rise and development, the shift from community-level food aid programs to individual household self-provisioning, and the effects of these changes. Findings from this research will contribute to social theories of volunteerism and welfare in market-based economies, and be critical for policy makers attempting to develop effective programs for food provisioning, including in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Many studies have shown that the ability to attend to items is highly limited; yet, it is unclear where these limits stem from and what the underlying neural mechanisms are that determine these limits. In this proposal we aim to test what constrains our ability to select information and to examine the flexibility of the human attention system across different selection demands and sensory environments. We use the human visual system as a model system to test how attention interacts with perceptual representations to guide behavior, and to examine how attention modulates neural activity to enhance perception and memory. Understanding how attention modulates these neural representations in visual cortex will help to uncover how variations in these neural patterns give rise to common perceptual and cognitive disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current research project aims to broadly understand how attention operates in different sensory environments and task contexts. We hypothesize that the capacity limits of feature-based attention are constrained by a combination of the organization of feature representations in the visual system (i.e., perceptual confusability) and by center-surround selection mechanisms. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the selection mechanisms are flexible and adjust to current task demands in terms of magnitude (enhancement and suppression) and shape (e.g., shifts in tuning curves; size of the inhibitory surround). Our approach includes psychophysics, computational modeling, and electrophysiological recordings (frequency-tagged potentials in EEG) that can tease apart perceptual factors from attentional effects, and allow to directly measure feature representations in visual cortex. Together, the proposed experiments will provide important insights into how perceptual organization and attention mechanisms interact to influence limits of attention, and will examine the flexibility of the human attention system across different task contexts. The development of novel experimental designs and neural measures to track perceptual representations in visual cortex and how they are modulated by attention will be important to test perceptual and cognitive models and how they influence visual processing more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In everyday life this might manifest as forgetting a person's name but not the person. Substantial inter-individual variability exists, with some older individuals showing episodic memory performance and neural recruitment equivalent to some young. Existing theories suggest that malleable lifestyle factors, like sleep, contribute to this variability but are not yet well-informed by such evidence. Established age-related declines in habitual sleep quality, the relationship between sleep and neural functioning in memory-supporting brain regions, and the role of sleep in episodic memory consolidation make sleep an essential lifestyle factor to examine. The primary goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the extent to which individual differences in sleep quality contribute to those in neural activity that, in turn, contribute to episodic memory success across the normal adult lifespan. Students from high school through graduate level receive hands on training in all aspects of conducting cognitive neuroscience research pertinent to human memory functioning and the health and lifestyle factors that influence it in diverse, adult lifespan samples. The potential impact of this research for understanding how malleable, individual difference factors affect cognitive decline in aging is high. These results from a large, racially diverse sample will inform existing theories of cognitive changes across the lifespan and future interventions by providing knowledge of the approximate age, specific brain systems, and aspects of memory for which sleep quality is most important and for which sleep interventions may be most effective in the general population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty utilizing cognitive control and the patterns of prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity underlying it is a major contributor to episodic memory decline in normal aging. Sleep quality is related to PFC integrity and its associated network connectivity. Normal aging has been shown to negatively affect this activity, sleep quality, and episodic memory performance but the relationship between these variables is unclear. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the extent to which age-related sleep disruptions contribute to those in PFC network activity during learning that, in turn, affect episodic memory performance. A mediation model is proposed in which poor sleep quality partially mediates the negative impact of healthy aging on episodic memory via reduced resolution of interference during learning, a major age-related cognitive control deficit. A diverse sample of 90 young, middle-aged, and older adult participants without sleep disorders, perform multiple episodic memory tasks that tax different interference resolution functions is measured to assess the generalizability of the negative impact of poor sleep. Episodic memory is assessed behaviorally and supporting brain activity measured with fMRI. In order to evaluate the specificity of the model to episodic memory, both episodic and item memory are tested. Memory is tested immediately following learning and after a 24-hour delay in order to separately assess the impact of sleep on new learning from consolidation. The influence of multiple confounds, including medication, naps, depression, and exercise is controlled through screening and statistical analyses. Objective measures of sleep are obtained using actigraphy, the best method for assessing habitual sleep patterns over multiple days for a large number of individuals naturally, in their homes, with minimal intrusion. Mediation results from average sleep estimates, the night immediately prior to memory testing, and night-to-night variability are compared in order to separate the impact of habitually poor sleep from variable or a poor night's sleep. Univariate analyses are used to identify PFC regions that support resolution of interference defined by activity that is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)-derived interference signals. Functional connectivity analyses are additionally applied to identify the networks affected by sleep quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Careful study of these patterns has led to great scientific and technological progress.  Brain-computer interfaces and brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are two examples.  These technologies depend strongly on the power to tie brain signals to (intended) actions.  In this project, we use state-of-the-art methods in cognitive science to develop a precise mathematical model of the link between brain activity and human behavior.  Our theory now needs to be tested with new experimental data in adverse conditions.  The challenges that will test whether this model can predict the brain-behavior link in new experiments, new behaviors, and new measures of brain activity.  A strong model of brain and behavior will improve our knowledge of the brain and help future research and technological development.  It can also improve the accuracy of science or technology that uses brain signals, including brain-computer interfaces.  The project will benefit researchers outside our lab in other ways.  We will document analyses and experiments as part of a series of video lectures.  We will also freely share our data, code, and methods online.  This will help other researchers to verify our findings and to educate members of the general public who have an interest in cognitive neuroscience.  Finally, the project will involve junior scientists who will receive training and start a career in neuroscience or cognitive science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary advantage of joint modeling is that it improves researchers' ability to estimate parameters of neural, cognitive, or behavioral models by using constraints imposed by one or more additional data modes.  This has already allowed us to construct genuine neurocognitive models that are jointly informed by behavioral and neural data.  We have developed a multimodal sequential accumulation model that makes predictions about the combination of reaction time, accuracy, and neuroelectric data, and that allows for conclusions not possible from either type of data individually.  We will now test the generalizability of this model to other contexts.  After first training a model on a relatively small data set, we will extrapolate its predictions to (a) new tasks by the same participants; (b) new participants in the same task; (c) new paradigms (i.e., tasks with new response modalities) by the same participants; and (d) new tasks by new participants.  For a rigorous test of the linkage between the neural and behavioral data, the experiments will involve manipulations that selectively affect the cognitive components (visual preprocessing, motor preparation time, evidence accumulation) as well as corresponding human behavior (reaction times, accuracies, and choice behavior) and electrophysiological signals (ERP latencies and magnitudes and EMG muscle preparation signatures).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, most of the work has been performed with methods that have not enabled one to address what happens in the brain in the millisecond and millimeter space at the single-subject individual level. As a result, several key questions in the field of cognitive neuroscience have remained open for exploration. One of these key unknowns that we are addressing in our current proposal is the question of how brain regions specialized in processing emotional information interact with those areas of our brain that are engaged in perceiving the outer world. How does our perception get colored by our emotion? Our findings will enrich our understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion generation while also constraining the plausibility of certain emotion theories. Our research will not only promote the progress of emotion and cognitive neuroscience, but also it will advance our understanding of how the mechanisms of healthy interaction between emotional and perceptual system might be affected in neuropsychiatric disorders and as such the proposed research will have potential benefits to our national health, prosperity and welfare. Lastly, through educational outreach programs, we will also support education and diversity to benefit our society.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on the interface between emotion and visual perception in the human brain. Our proposed research aims to explore how stimulus-driven and cognitively-modulated emotional processes affect our visual perception of faces.

In addition to intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS), we will measure subjective report, behavior, and pupillary activity. Our research involves human subjects undergoing invasive monitoring for several days as part of clinical evaluation for refractory focal epilepsy. Stimulus-driven emotions are generated by biologically entrenched perceptions that may not be necessarily accessible to conscious awareness; as such, stimulus-driven emotions are associated with prototypical responses that quickly prepare for action.  Emotional faces, such as those expressing anger and joy/happiness, are used to elicit stimulus-driven emotions.  In contrast, cognitively-modulated emotions are generated through cognitive processes such as contextual information that lead to cognitive appraisal of how a stimulus relates to one's motivations, rather than a specific perceptual stimulus per se.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

What factors guide the many decisions that translate mental health care into algorithms, a set of instructions carried out by AI? There is tremendous variation in how these companies make mental health into an object that is measurable and/or treatable via algorithm. Facial expressions, vocal tone, word choice, or smartphone usage patterns become potential sources of data that communicate mental health states. In other words, companies do not simply collect data; they determine what counts as data sources and establish the correlation of this data to mental health states, and they are doing so in very different ways. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, the project would broadly disseminate its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of improving mental health diagnosis and treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valerie Black, under the supervision of Dr. Karen Nakamura at the University of California at Berkeley, will explore how technology companies design AI for mental health diagnosis and treatment. The algorithms developed by companies that gather and analyze mental health data are typically proprietary. Since these algorithms are being developed at a time when AI can determine matters ranging from bank loan eligibility to criminal sentencing, there is a growing call for AI decision-making transparency. This project asks how mental health technology companies in the US and Japan (two major, interconnected centers of AI development) are addressing this concern, and how that impacts the ways in which they use AI to provide care. Research will take place at three AI companies (two in the U.S. and one in Japan) in the understudied startup technology sector. Data collection includes interviews and participant observation with innovators and investors, psychological service leads, and engineers and developers. Data will be analyzed to ascertain what objectives, ethical and practical considerations, and relationships inform the mental health care algorithms. This ethnographic investigation aims to further scientific understanding of how different configurations of and approaches to AI make possible an array of different (and sometimes clashing) objectives, strategies, and core beliefs about what constitutes optimal ways of caring for mental health.

In 2006, the US Department of Defense developed for the first time official criteria for the use of FDA-approved psychiatric medications ""in theater"", in the physical and tactical spaces of military operations including active combat. Conservative estimates suggest that 1 in 6 service members is now taking at least one psychiatric medication. The use of psychiatric medications by the US military has attracted public attention, and is poised to influence the ways that Americans think about soldiering and the nature of war. Studies on the topic remain largely theoretical and center on the ethics of military psychiatric medication use. This project aims to understand how these medications are prescribed and used in practice, as well as how military service members understand medication effects on the work of counterinsurgency. The results from this study will have important implications for public knowledge and policy, as well as for veteran advocates and clinical practice aimed at the post-service transition of veterans. The project fosters the inclusion of underrepresented student veterans in military and veteran-related academic research and to support diversity in social and behavioral science. It will do so by 1) mentoring student veterans, 2) bringing together researchers and veterans in a symposium to address ways forward for collaborative research, and 3) publishing a co-edited volume on this important topic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jocelyn Chua of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will explore how psychiatric medications have been assimilated into the operations, infrastructures and norms of post-9/11 counterinsurgency, how these medications are understood and experienced by soldiers, and what impact these medications have had on the cultural landscape of soldiering in the U.S. Given the Army's prescription trends and prominent role in ground combat operations compared with other military branches, the research will focus on the US Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. The PI and research team will use in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation to understand the formal and informal ways that psychiatric medications are being prescribed, accessed, used, and shared. The research team will also assess enlisted soldiers' experiences of psychiatric medication use in deployment and their evaluations of the propriety of these medications to counterinsurgency soldiering.

Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Return migrants are members of the diaspora who migrate back to their homeland. There they are not always easily assimilated, even though they share a language and cultural history with local residents. Thus, return migrants challenge common sense ideas of borders, nation, and citizenship. Given the increased global mobility of the world's populations today, it is important to understand why and how return migrants remain apart from the society they have returned to  and whether or not this situation can be remedied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by University of Texas at Austin anthropology doctoral student Hannah Foster, with guidance from Dr. Anthony Webster. The researcher has chosen to study the situation of return Kazakh migrants in Qaraghandy, Kazakhstan, a city that has received large waves of return migrants in recent years. Because the returnees may come from countries with which the Kazakhstan government has uneasy relationships, these return Kazakhs have been the object of governmental attention and special programs. This makes this a productive research site for studying return immigrant integration. The researcher will focus her data collection on a special integration center where the migrants learn Russian and get access to services. Prior research has demonstrated that these interactions may be mediated by the use of multiple languages and shaped by connections back to the diasporic community they left, creating complex communication networks. The researcher will collect data with a combination of linguistic and ethnographic methods including participant observation, recording naturally occurring discourse, matched-guise experiments, feedback interviews, and narrative analysis. Findings from this research will produce new understandings of the return migration processes in relation to maintaining the stability of the nation state.

And one area of social life where ritual is most critical is in the disposition of a community's dead. among This is of particular concern for communities that have been displaced by conflict, where death rates are exceptionally high, and individuals face insecurity and a daunting scarcity of physical and legal resources that challenge the social order. The research supported by this award, which supports the training of a graduate student in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, asks how host societies deal with the high number of displaced migrants' deaths, and what role mortuary and funerary practices have for displaced communities. According to the UNHCR, the world is witnessing the highest level of forced migration on record, making this a particularly appropriate time to examine this question. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of delivering humanitarian aid. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and builds capacity and scientific infrastructure through international cooperation among scientific research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foroogh Farhang, under the supervision of Dr. Jessica Winegar of Northwestern University, explores the extent to which mortuary and funerary practices are impacted by war and displacement, and what resources, networks, rituals, and relationships are marshaled in the burial and propitiation of the dead. The research takes place in Lebanon, where after seven years of civil war in neighboring Syria, displaced Syrians are the first refugee community with no formal camps and cemeteries. They have faced the increasingly stark challenges of securing one of the scarce number of burial sites and, further, holding a proper funeral for their dead. A lack of burial spaces, in conjunction with increasing restrictions on crossing the Lebanon-Syria border, have mobilized networks of Syrian burials within the borders of Lebanon and on the route from Lebanon to Syria. Because this involves such a sizable population, and the issue is so significantly culturally, this site proves an ideal laboratory for understanding what variables aid and inhibit cultural integration. Through in-depth, long-term, and on-site ethnographic fieldwork on people's mobility within Lebanon and between Lebanon and Syria, data will be collected through interviews, participant observation, life histories, and media research among representative samples of refugees, governmental and non-governmental staff, and local leaders and community members. Data will be subjected to thematic and content analysis in order to identify, quantify, and evaluate relevant codes and themes. This study draws upon classic anthropological concerns with ritual and death to examine whether its theoretical assumptions are influenced by variables that are acutely apparent in contemporary contexts marked by war, migration, refugee integration, and transnational NGOs.

The answer to this question is unclear. For example, some research has suggested that meditation changes human attention and alters the body's immune response, blood pressure, and other physiological markers. Other research has found that active church going may improve one's health. Weekly church attendance has been found in some studies to add two years on average to the length of the congregant's life. However, critics point out that the reported improved health could result simply from relaxation (in the case of meditation) and social support (in the case of church going), and have nothing to do with the religious contexts in which these practices take place. To help resolve this debate, anthropologist Tanya Marie Luhrmann will use scientific measures to examine the effects of religion-based training on cognitive performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Luhrmann and her team will focus on one group of religious practitioners who train for intensive prayer practice. The researchers will collect data from this population by combining intensive and repeated interviewing with a neuroscience evaluation using a tested EEG neurophysiological protocol. They will collect data from both highly experienced practitioners and novices to see whether those who are more experienced perform differently. Findings from the research will help health researchers better understand if there is a neurophysiological basis to reported experiences of mental cultivation and whether training affects these experiences.

For example, written communications, whether public signage, billboards, books, instruction manuals, or even consumer electronics interfaces, depend on the purposeful deployment of typefaces and fonts. The typeface or font chosen in each case carries its own meaning, which influences the message received and resonates with readers through these shared cultural forms, even if readers are unaware. Surprisingly, considering typeface's ubiquity and importance, this area of social life has been little studied. Social scientists have examined typeface primarily in narrow, cognitive terms, such as by studying relative readability. But much wider research is needed to understand how the many different typefaces that populate societies are created, selected, and used, and how they ultimately build and influence communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Keith M.

International development groups refer to these as ""child marriages"" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why ""child marriage"" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood.

However, the finding that specific diseases vary in prevalence across populations has given rise to questions and concerns that extend beyond the biological.  These are such questions as, Will diagnosis become the impetus for discrimination in the funding of research or the availability of treatment? Could an association between diseases and sub-populations become a tool for political organizing or social and cultural differentiation? The anthropological research supported by this award will investigate these issues through a focus on sickle cell disease, a group of blood disorders that affects the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Sickle cell is the most common genetic disease worldwide and affects as many as 100,000 Americans. Because sickle cell is also uneven in its distribution, it is an appropriate domain for investigating concerns about changing understandings of the relationship between genes and social life. Genetic diseases increasingly dominate the landscape of biomedicine worldwide, and this project will help to understand the socio-political implications of these shifts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Cornell University anthropology doctoral student, Rebekah Ciribassi, with guidance from Dr. Stacey Langwick. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research in Tanzania, because it has one of the world's highest rates of children born with sickle cell disease. Because sickle cell in Tanzania is at the center of a growing network of infrastructure, advocacy, research, and care, including widespread testing, the disease is discussed widely in the public forum, which will make any socio-political relationships easier to uncover and track over time than would be the case where the disease is less common or less talked about. The researcher has identified two areas of the country, Mwanza and Zanzibar, where people are grappling with sickle cell disease but where the political, racial, and social histories through which they make sense of an inherited disease are very different. This funding is for the second phase of the research, the component to be carried out in Zanzibar. The investigators will gather data from (1) medical practitioners who work in sickle cell disease care in a hospital setting; (2) sickle cell advocacy group participants; and (3) diagnosed families. She will employ a mix-method social science approach including: archival and discourse analysis; participant observation in hospital clinics; and interviews and life history interviews with diagnosed families. The investigators will build a comparison between the data collected in the Zanzibari context and the data collected in Mwanza, with special  attention to emergent themes around blood; kinship (e.g., inheritance and reproduction); race and ethnicity; and nation. The resulting analysis will assess how genetic medicine integrates with extra-clinical contexts. The results of this research will offer an important contribution to literature on the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of genetic medicine.

When public programs and private financial resources both recede, what kinds of social resources do chronically ill people, who need stable access to pharmaceuticals, mobilize in order to survive? Social scientific accounts of unmet healthcare needs associated with economic crises have largely focused on the developing world. Less is known about the relationship between austerity and healthcare resources in contexts such as the U.S. or Europe. This research addresses pharmaceutical access under austerity in a context with a previously robust universal healthcare system. Deepening financial and healthcare inequalities associated with economic crisis have given way to newly disenfranchised people that must seek pharmaceuticals in a therapeutic economy characterized by frequent crisis-driven reformulations. This research, which is centered on training a graduate student in rigorous methods of scientific data collection and analysis, seeks to understand the kinds of social resources people mobilize in order to address unmet pharmaceutical needs, when public healthcare is no longer dependable and financial resources and pharmaceuticals are unevenly distributed. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student, the project would improve scientific understanding through broadly disseminating its findings to governmental and non-governmental organizations charged with improving public health access, as they mediate the differential impacts of austerity on healthcare outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Taylor Bell, under the supervision of Dr. Cristiana Giordano of the University of California at Davis, will explore what forms of social networks replace public infrastructures under conditions of austerity in healthcare access. This research takes place in Athens, Greece, which has instituted the most stringent austerity measures targeting public healthcare across Europe. Athens has the highest concentration of state-sponsored healthcare resources in Greece, and so, will best highlight how people adjust pharmaceutical-seeking practices when public resources disappear. In order to learn how pharmaceuticals are exchanged and the relationships that facilitate these exchanges, the co-PI will conduct participant observation in emergent grassroots solidarity clinics and pharmacies, which many people turned to after austerity measures eroded the universal healthcare system, cutting its budget by more than 50%. The co-PI will also track, map, and analyze pharmaceutical networks and therapeutic economies through a range of observational and archival methods on extended social networks, as well as interviews (through both the McGill Illness Narrative Interview, and well as targeted semi-structured follow-ups) with a representative sample of pharmaceutical seekers. The findings will contribute to debates in medical, political, and economic anthropology about inequality, specifically in the differential distribution of healthcare burdens under conditions of economic austerity.

This project asks what coastal citizens value about the American shore in the near future, and how their investments intersect with the long-term goals of ecological restoration science. On the one hand, how do the promises of restoration science affect the way people whose livelihoods depend upon the coast approach their own environmental management practices in the present? On the other hand, what kinds of local histories and epistemological orientations inform the far-future goals of ecological restoration? Situated in southern Louisiana, where state-funded, large-scale infrastructural projects aim to recover lost wetlands and rejuvenate the state's coastal communities, this research will investigate the concept of ecological restoration in Louisiana, asking how the possibility of restoring the Louisiana coast is affecting local expectations of the future environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannah Burnett, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago, will explore whether the unprecedented rates of wetland erosion along the Louisiana coast have shaped expectations and behaviors along different temporal scales. In the wake of several largescale disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 BP oil spill, Louisiana has proposed to install several river diversions that will re-route sections of the lower Mississippi River, releasing sediment-rich water across eroding wetlands in order to build new land. These infrastructural projects aim to rebuild Louisiana's rapidly eroding coast by mimicking the natural flood events that slowly accumulate into the state's wetlands. The project described here will take place in the coastal communities in southeastern Louisiana that will be most directly affected by these river diversions. By interviewing local fisherpeople and accompanying them in their daily practices, the researchers propose to shed light on the different cycles that fisherpeople rely upon, examining the moments when these cycles are affected by the longer-term goals of wetland restoration. In addition, the researchers will conduct interviews with restoration scientists, along with archival research, to better understand the history of ecological restoration in Louisiana, the metrics that determine progress towards restoration, and the timescales at which scientists project restoration will be achieved.

At the same time, flood, drought, and contamination mark several ways that water can also pose a threat to life. Human activity -- such as mismanagement, travel, pollution, conflict, and widening social disparities -- can also contribute to water's potential danger, including the spread of deadly waterborne diseases. Sudden or otherwise dramatic disruptions in drinking-water quality expose important ways that humans value such an invaluable resource. To develop programs, policies, and infrastructure that ensure all Americans access to safe water, it is critical to understand not only the interacting human and environmental factors that lead to drinking-water contamination, but also the ways that individuals and societies adjust to water crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new presence of cholera in Haiti provides an exemplary case through which to study the dynamic relationship between humans and water. Cholera is a waterborne disease that causes profuse diarrhea and possible death from rapid fluid loss. The investigators, who started traveling to Haiti in 2008, have been researching the cholera epidemic there since it began in 2010, nine months after the earthquake. The investigators' extensive understanding of the local context, robust network of contacts, and previous data with which to make comparisons will foster the successful implementation and impact of forthcoming research. The research will be conducted in the coastal city and surrounding rural areas of Saint-Marc, Haiti, near the mouth of the Artibonite River, which was contaminated with cholera bacteria in October 2010, sparking one of the largest cholera epidemics in recent history. Though preventable by drinking clean water and treatable with timely rehydration, and despite significant national and international investment in relief efforts, many Haitians remain vulnerable to infection. With the disease now endemic, the presence of cholera has likely prompted substantial changes in the political economy, management, and consumption of water in Haiti. Investigators will assess the extent to which drinking-water for many Haitians has gone from a trusted common resource to a market commodity, industrialized product, or privately administered good. They will also evaluate whether these changes, driven by local and international actors, are resulting in improved access to safe water, particularly among the poor. Based in Saint-Marc, investigators will conduct interviews, archival, and participant-based research, observe and participate in everyday life, shadow clinicians, water engineers, and water entrepreneurs, and collect quantitative data about water quality and household water use.

For immigrants to the United States and other countries, it is an often-repeated ""rule"" that language shift typically occurs by the third generation (i.e., the grandchildren of the original immigrants). This project, which trains a student in rigorous, empirically-grounded methods of data collection and analysis in cultural and linguistic anthropology, asks what factors might contribute to influence language shift among an earlier generational cohort. Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Whereas many once assumed that modernization and urbanization would be accompanied by secularization, faith-based movements and their political effects have only become more relevant worldwide. Religious politics have not only transformed the political sphere; politicization has also changed religion and religious practices. This project, which trains an anthropology graduate student in methods of scientifically rigorous and empirical data collection and analysis, explores what impact the institutionalization of religion in government has on transforming the public sphere, urban space, and practices of piety. By examining the effects of governance on religious practices, urban planning, capitalism, tourism, and identity, the project advances our understanding of modernity and state-building in socio-religious contexts. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, contributes the education of underrepresented groups, and builds capacity and scientific infrastructure through international cooperation in these scientific research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow, under the supervision of Dr. Hussein Agrama of the University of Chicago, proposes to explore how shrine pilgrimage and its material relationship to shifting practices of governance, religious pilgrimage, and piety impact the organization of urban space, cultural beliefs about modernity, and conceptions of self and community. This project examines how institutionalization of religion has affected popular practices of religiosity, specifically a network of shrines in a range of urban and non-urban settings with varying levels of state political oversight. The research will be conducted at three sites (in major city, a secondary city that is known for its shrine, and a city that has been rebranded as a hub for religious tourism). Utilizing interviews, participant-observation, and archival, research will investigate how pilgrims, locals, urban planners, architects, and other stakeholders understand the transformation of these sites. This research will contribute to debates in political anthropology about governance, theories in the anthropology of religion about pilgrimage, mobility, and tourism, and analyses in urban anthropology about space and sectarian identity. Findings from this research will provide insight into how religious politics are lived on the ground and how the administrative and bureaucratic practices of governance in a modern state transform the role of religion in public life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These have included both thoroughgoing legislative reforms and specific banking sector reorganizations. Now, a decade later, the research supported by this award asks an important question: how have these changes affected the day-to-day practices and values of those working in finance?  Unlike most research on finance, this ethnographic project is focused on the local and the micro-processes through which global change must occur. This is a critically important and often missing perspective. In some locales the banking crisis has persisted. Understanding the motivations and activities of those who actually practice finance is a key part of identifying the underpinnings of financial resilience and avoiding future crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Yale University anthropology doctoral student, Theodore Park, with the guidance of Dr. Paul Kockelman. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research in northern Italy because it is one site where the financial crisis has continued, despite targeted legislation, and because Italian reforms are sometimes identified as potential models for reforms in the United States. The researcher will collect data with a comparative research design, focusing on two wealth management firms, one of which has chosen to adopt the reforms and become publicly traded, and one of which has chosen to sustain its earlier identity as a local, private institution. The researcher will focus on the effects of variable institutional structures; the impacts of legislation, particularly the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; and variation in ethical discourse and practices. Study populations will include wealth managers, fund managers, support staff, clients, and family members. Data will be collected through a mix of ethnographic methods including participant observations, semi-structured interviews, life history mappings, surveys, and focus groups. These data will be supplemented with archival research; compilations of relevant legislation; and analyses of media, including manager training materials and social media. Findings from this research will be shared with policy makers, the institutions studied, and the general public.

The project integrates disparate scholarly subfields as historians work with oceanographers to extend the instrumental meteorological record back two centuries and with a broader geographical distribution than is currently available. For safety, mariners recorded hazards to navigation on their charts, as well as weather data. The project extracts substantial meteorological data from historic logbooks, records heretofore inaccessible to modern scientists, and makes them freely available online. The investigators use these historic weather records to address current questions regarding shifts in wind and atmospheric pressure patterns. These include changes in high pressure systems that are related to the subtropical dry zones on land and the westerly storm tracks that steer the passage of rain-bearing weather systems. The understanding of past variability in these wind and atmospheric pressure patterns has societal relevance as these patterns directly impact agricultural productivity and can improve weather forecasting and modelling. Furthermore, the research can identify weather and navigational data that are of practical benefit to contemporary shipping, underscoring the project's importance to modern commercial navigation and maritime defense. The project includes training students in convergent science. Research results will be made available to the public via informal learning opportunities at museums and to the broader scientific community at interdisciplinary conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term datasets are invaluable to meteorological research as they establish a baseline against which to measure recent changes, can validate models, and illuminate how the atmosphere and ocean interact. The historic logbooks being analyzed contain systematic weather observations (e.g., wind strength and direction, storms, sea state, precipitation, air temperature, atmospheric pressure) that will significantly extend the instrumental record. The newly-recovered historical data are combined with existing observational and reanalysis products to understand robustness and long-term context of variations in the Earth's atmospheric circulation over the past approximately 250 years. The investigators specifically consider: (a) changes in the Hadley circulation that are related to the expansion of subtropical dry zones, such as in the U.S. Southwest; and (b) changes in strength and position of subtropical high-pressure systems as manifestations of the descending limb of Hadley Cell circulation and changes in strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds that were traversed by the whalers on their way to historical whaling grounds and which have recently experienced strong poleward shifts. Understanding long-term variability in subtropical high-pressure systems and westerly storm tracks has relevance for any regions affected by such meteorological patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Iron and aluminum are abundant and widely distributed, but major deposits of many other critically important metals are scarce, so these must be obtained by international trade. The southern third of the African continent is unusually rich in the rarer metals. It has the world's largest reserves of platinum, cobalt, copper and manganese, and has historically produced more gold than any other region.  Mining and metallurgy now account for a major proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most nations in central and southern Africa, but few know that mining in this region began long ago.  Iron and copper have been mined and smelted here since at least 200 AD, and gold since at least 1200 AD.  Copper objects are often found in archaeological sites far from any potential source of copper. Few citizens of southern and central African are aware of the extent of precolonial mining, or of trade in copper in this region.  The anticipated results of this project on ancient copper mining and trade will likely be widely covered in African print and electronic news media, and will be incorporated into educational materials for African schools and universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research funded by this award will study the circulation of copper within southern Africa between 200 CE to about 1700 CE. Dr. David Killick and graduate student Jay Stephens will collaborate with archaeologists in southern Africa, and with geochemists at the University of Arizona, to reconstruct long-distance movements of copper in prehistoric times by matching the lead isotope ratios of copper objects to those from ore deposits throughout the region.  This research will provide a novel way to study some key issues in the archaeology of southern Africa.  These include: tracing the routes taken by the earliest metal-using peoples (the Bantu migration) into South Africa; establishing when mining of specific copper deposits began; documenting trade links between the major prehistoric states in the region; and providing a new way to look at the changes that occurred in these trading systems after Europeans settled in the region, from the early sixteenth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project explores the diverse approaches urban administrators use to stabilize urban environments, where models forecast persistent uncertainties in public infrastructural planning and increased reliance on stakeholder inputs. The data will be important for American municipalities searching for alternatives in urban infrastructural planning around uncertain futures. Findings will be disseminated to various governmental, non-governmental, and other organizations concerned with evaluating the limits and opportunities associated with water and sewage infrastructure, and coastline management.

This research will examine the impact of solar, wind, and biomass energy technologies on the everyday lives of people in the East African nation of Tanzania. Tanzania is a particularly appropriate place for such a study because the state's pursuit of traditional carbon energy development has been coupled with a notable rise in alternative, renewable energy investment by public and private sources. It provides an appropriate laboratory for investigating energy consumption at the household level, where 90% of energy consumption takes place). The researchers have each worked for over a decade in Tanzania, and their in-country research background is geographically diverse, providing the opportunity to consider different approaches to energy use in rural, urban, peri-urban, and island contexts. Because the existing literature tends to overlook the role of women in energy production and consumption, gendered energy labor and use is an important focus of this research. With gender and geographic range in mind, the core of the research for this project will be conducted through critical case studies in domestic settings in three diverse sites. The researchers will use purposive sampling to identify socioeconomically diverse households who are using a range of energy technologies. Using the methods of observation, interviews, and focus groups, they will investigate the socioeconomic dimensions of renewable energy development. The researchers will also conduct interviews with energy experts, advocates, suppliers, policymakers, investors, and technicians in the public and private sector. Findings from the project will make important contributions to scientific discussions about the optimization of energy extraction, theories of inequality, and debates about infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Every day in the United States, more than 1.4 million youth caregivers support family members who have a chronic illness, disability, or other health issue that requires help, supervision or support. Youth caregivers often assume responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. They may also support basic activities of daily living such as assisting in mobility, dressing, feeding, and administering medication. Like adult caregivers, youth caregivers encounter a diversity of social, cultural, and geographic or spatial impacts which vary according to the type and intensity of care they provide to a loved one. However, unlike adult caregivers, youth in the United States tend not to be recognized for the care that they provide. Furthermore, there are few public programs that provide support for their distinct needs. As pressure upon family caregivers intensifies in the U.S. with the aging of the population and projected shortages of paid care workers, young people are likely to play a larger role in providing support, comfort, and assistance to family members. Results from this research will be widely disseminated to researchers, social service providers and educational professionals, with implications for youth caregiver health and wellbeing. Additionally, the investigator and a graduate student will work directly with youth caregivers to support the creation of a participatory digital caregiving project, creating opportunities for STEM education related to digital design and production, technology use, and science communication.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to understanding how youth caregiving impacts childhood geographies. The project will focus on three key objectives: 1) to understand the relationship between youth caregiver recognition and identity; 2) to explore how youth caregiving impacts childhood perceptions of time, space, scale, and place; and, 3) to identify ways to better incorporate youth caregiving into future research and policies of family caregiving in the United States. Youth caregivers will participate in oral histories and a ""care mapping"" exercise to analyze the relationship between caregiving identity and childhood geographies. Analysis of project documents, and participatory digital projects with youth caregivers will provide additional information about recognition and caregiver identity. The research will take place with young people who receive support from the Caregiving Youth Project, a nonprofit organization that works with school districts to provide services to youth caregivers in Palm Beach County, Florida. Though the work is limited to one geographic area in the United States, the findings are relevant to understanding the experiences of family caregiving by this largely hidden population. The theories and methodologies developed in this research will provide new insights and approaches to research on childhood geographies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This remarkable skill has led to the hypothesis that children come to this task with an innate ability to learn certain types of grammatical patterns, namely those manifested in the languages of the world. Through exposure, they learn which patterns are relevant to their language. For example, children learning English initially produce a type of complex questions not grammatical in English, but resembling grammatical German questions. Over time, they learn this pattern is not English and no longer use it. An alternative explanation for these errors is that limited general cognitive capacities, specifically memory, attention, and sentence planning result in productions which only superficially resemble German questions. The goal of the project is to tease apart these possible explanations through controlled experimentation comparing elicited questions and answers by English speaking children and by German speaking children. The two hypotheses predict different error types. If the errors are the result of an innate predisposition, German speaking children should produce some questions resembling English. If the errors are the result of limited cognitive abilities, children learning each language should produce questions which are not consistent with such a predisposition. This research holds the potential to be used as a clinical diagnostic for investigating children's linguistic and cognitive development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research comprises novel experiments designed to test production and comprehension of multiclausal questions. Children between the ages of four and six will be given tests designed to assess their attention, working memory, and sentence planning abilities. By comparing performance of English and German speaking children, this project will further illuminate the role of input in language learning and provide a baseline for comparison for English-speaking children. Novel contributions include furthering the use and integration of psycholinguistic methodologies into linguistic work as well as investigating German children's as yet unstudied acquisition of this complex syntactic phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Yet the models archaeologists typically employ are strongly conditioned by a limited number of historical and ethnographic cases that are inextricably linked to modern states.  Archaeologists are now recognizing great organizational variability among ancient complex societies, and in the pathways by which societies become complex. This project will investigate the varied roles that secondary centers play within the development of complex, non-state systems, highlighting organizational postures not documented in the ethnographic or historical present.

This is of concern because of the potential public health consequences. To date issues of air pollution and soil contamination in UCGs have been understudied, yet UCGs proliferate, and have been lauded as a means of addressing questions of food access and urban sustainability. This investigation advances the understanding of human-environmental interactions and urban political ecology theory as the relationship between air pollution, soils, and gardening in cities needs to be critically evaluated for it to have the positive outcomes generally associated with it. If airborne or soil trace element sources are significant in UCG contamination, then there are potential repercussions in scholarship, policy, and the promotion of urban gardens.  As well as generating new knowledge with public health ramifications about the degree to which there is atmospheric and soil contamination in UCGs, and the contamination pathways, the project includes educational and training opportunities for gardeners, especially participants from under-represented groups. The research also broadens scholarly diversity in urban garden contamination research, and derives societal benefits in raising awareness constructively, spreading effective preventive strategies, and providing data typically beyond gardeners' reach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's aim is to evaluate the importance of bulk atmospheric deposition compared to other proximate contaminant sources, trace elements in the soil (arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel, and lead) and gardening inputs, in urban community gardens. The project systematically assesses the role of atmospheric deposition in relation to trace element contamination in urban community gardens. The investigation takes place in a sample of UCGs in New York City, where the PIs will conduct archival research about the site of each of the UCGs to develop a land-use history. In tandem they will conduct soil surveys to assess the spatial variability of trace element and determine representative soil and crop sampling points. Gardening inputs, vegetables, and soils will be sampled and analyzed for trace element concentrations. Soils will be sampled at multiple depths and analyzed for variables affecting trace element mobility. Part of the vegetables sampled will be grown under row cover to discern variables other than atmospheric deposition. Frisbee-type funnel-bottle bulk collectors will be set up and sampled monthly for a year to gather atmospheric influx data which will be compared to city air quality information. Findings are expected to be transferable to UCGs in other large cities with manufacturing histories and with decades of reliance on fossil-fuel based transport. The techniques developed through this project are also generally applicable to rural areas and small cities. Therefore, although this research project will focus on atmospheric deposition in urban community gardens, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with food production and contamination problems in urban areas in the United States and many other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Managing the transnational flow of people is one of the greatest challenges facing nation-states in the 21st century, requiring governments to negotiate complex issues of sovereignty, national security, and human safety and well being. PICs present a potentially promising approach to regulating transnational mobility as they are often less expensive and easier to implement than traditional enforcement strategies. However, little is known about the use of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement. This project contributes to research in the field of political geography by producing new empirical data on an under-examined enforcement mechanism, while also contributing to theoretical understandings of how nation-states govern. The findings of this project will have implications for national security, ensuring that border enforcement efforts are effective, economically efficient, and safe. The dissemination plan, including a publicly available website and StoryMap, will enable public engagement and science communication while also providing easily accessible information for migration research and education. Graduate research assistants within the project team will also promote the development and training of a diverse and competitive workforce in the geographical sciences.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three objectives: 1) to trace the development of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement; 2) to map the spatial and institutional frameworks through which PICs have been created and distributed and how these distribution networks relate to the form, content, and effectiveness of campaigns; and 3) to identify the role PICs play in producing political geographies of border enforcement.  A mixed-methods, comparative approach is used to achieve these objectives.  Research methods include textual analysis, semi-structured interviews, and geo-visualization techniques that combines quantitative and qualitative data sets. A comparative approach is useful when examining border and immigration enforcement strategies for it illustrates the nuances of enforcement in distinct contexts, while also providing insight into how national governments communicate and collaborate. Comparison of case studies in the US and Australia will enable the researchers to explore how specific cultural, economic, political, and geographic contexts affects the development and implementation of PICs as a mechanism of border enforcement, illuminating the potential of this strategy across contexts and providing insight on the best practices for effectively mobilizing PICs as an enforcement strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

According to basic theory in biogeography, the relative importance of the biological and environmental factors that affect species coexistence, and thus diversity, varies with spatial scale.  The research assesses the relative importance of the controlling factors as well as specific geographies of location within increasing spatial scales and among places that vary in isolation.  This change with scale and isolation is relevant to fundamental understanding of how diversity arises and is maintained, and this research helps guide interpretation of observations of current global change impacts.  For this project, the alpine tundra biome serves as a useful model system because its plant community composition varies across and within mountain ranges and regions.  Project results will be shared with other researchers working on such interpretation in global ecological monitoring programs, such as the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments, as well as with the general public through outreach via the National Park Service's Crown of the Continent Learning Center.  The STEM workforce will be strengthened through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the role of spatial scale in plant community biogeography.  The investigator will assess the variation in plant community composition in alpine tundra in relation to three factors: local habitat (such as soils and topography), climate (biologically relevant seasonal variables), and geographic distance (a proxy for past dispersal).  Which of the three factors, with multiple variables for each, is most important to the patterns of diversity among plots within distances ranging from 100 meters to greater than 1000 kilometers, will be determined statistically.  The pattern of changes in their relative importance along a gradient of increasing distances will be analyzed.  Specifics of isolation will be evaluated through the inclusion of discontinuous ranges.  These analyses test the fundamental theory that the drivers change in a regular pattern as scale is increased.  The project increases knowledge of the importance of spatial interpretation in biogeographic theory and its applications.  The alpine tundra found in an arc across southern-to-eastern Europe, from Spain to Romania, will be studied because the species composition and environment has been recorded for thousands of plots with the same methodology.  Insights for biogeographic theory and applications will be relevant to other alpine regions, such as those of the western United States, as well as to other biomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Effective visual representations of motion are needed to reveal and communicate complex patterns and processes of societal importance. This project will contribute insights into how humans perceive movement patterns and advance knowledge on the effectiveness of different cartographic techniques in mapping interaction in motion. The theory, methods, and tools developed by this project can be used broadly to map and study movement across diverse disciplines such as geographic information science (GIS), ecology, transportation, and health. Through collaboration with industry, this study will bridge the gap between academic research and industry by contributing new cartographic techniques to existing commercial GIS software products which are used by researchers, policy makers, students, and others worldwide. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained for research in STEM, partnering with industry, writing scientific publications, and developing geographic visualization tools. The visualization methods and tools will be made publicly available and used for training students to develop maps in motion through classroom settings and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will create a new theoretical framework for the cartography of movement and test it on examples taken from movement ecology and human mobility. It will investigate two overarching research questions: (1) What are fundamental visual principles and design elements for representing motion in accurate and effective ways? (2) How can representation of motion advance our knowledge and understanding of interaction? By addressing these two research questions, this research will contribute new cartographic methods to facilitate effective transformation of raw movement data into useful knowledge of motion in different contexts (i.e. animal and human movements).  To assess the efficacy of the proposed framework and the usability of developed methods, a series of evaluative user studies and eye-tracking experiments will be conducted. User study experiments will generate guidelines on effective and more plausible ways of communicating movement patterns.  As a research use case, this research will investigate the question of how visualization of motion helps to understand species interaction, in this case endangered tigers in Thailand. Although this research focuses on the cartography of motion, it will contribute methods and techniques to advance the understanding of interaction between individuals in dynamic social and ecological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Identifying generalities in the factors that confer vulnerability or resilience to species based on their innate characteristics (their species traits) and where they naturally occur (their geography or spatial traits) in relation to threats, is the intellectual contribution of this project and to geography and the spatial sciences. Results from this study permit a prioritization of species and ecosystems and identify locations for management and conservation of plant diversity. This project will be conducted at the University of California Riverside (UCR), a Hispanic-serving institution located in one of the most socio-economically and culturally diverse regions in the United States. The PIs will leverage existing STEM education initiatives at UCR to engage undergraduates in local K-12 classrooms through the CalTeach program, where they will introduce spatial science and models as a framework for understanding geographic concepts, ecological principles and pressing conservation issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vulnerability of a plant species to threat depends on their distribution (biogeography) in relation to these threats, as well as their species traits. Plants may be long or short lived (redwood trees versus poppies), escape habitat fragmentation and loss because their ecological niche places them in locations undesirable for development, or they may have traits that allow them to recover their populations following fire (fire-stimulated seed germination, or resprouting from underground parts). In a changing environment, plants can only move (migrate) away from threats intergenerationally, mainly via seed dispersal. This project identifies the general aspects of spatial traits (biogeography) versus species traits that confer more or less vulnerability to plants under global change in the coming century as human populations grow and land-use changes. The PIs use simulation modeling to project the population growth or decline for a wide range of plant species that differ in their disturbance-response and other species traits (life form: trees, shrubs, herbs; fire-response; and morphological traits) and their biogeography (coastal, mountain and desert distributions) to identify generalities regarding their vulnerability to threats. They develop and use statistical models of spatially explicit fire risk and species biogeography using modern regression and machine learning methods and use those models to project spatially explicit changes under different land-use and environmental scenarios. The PIs construct plant population models using data from the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and will extract species traits from the TRY Plant Trait Database. This project focuses on the biodiversity of the California Floristic Province, but trends identified will be broadly relevant throughout the entire western U.S. where water-limited ecosystems are strongly impacted by increasing environmental variability and increasing wildfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Reducing and managing risks from storm surge are challenging because of the complex nature of the hazard and the inherent uncertainty in storm surge forecasting. Weather forecasters and emergency managers often use maps and animations (visualizations) to communicate storm surge risks and threats to the public. However, little is known about how these visualizations influence people's understanding and response to risk. This project will contribute to research on visualizations and how well these work for the communication of hazardous weather risks.  By focusing on attachment to place within the context of coastal communities, the investigators will improve understanding of how people interact with information about coastal hazards and what role visualizations play in understanding and decision-making. The investigators will engage with practitioners and stakeholders throughout the project, from the planning stages to dissemination of the research results, ensuring project relevancy and building strong societal benefit for the needs of affected communities. This project will support educational activities through interdisciplinary training of students and faculty at a variety of institutions including from minority serving colleges and universities. The project will contribute to broader efforts to increase public scientific literacy by focusing on the role of visualizations in communicating complex scientific concepts in a relatable and usable manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to fundamental theoretical and methodological advances in geography, geospatial science, cartography, as well as decision, risk and management science and their intersection with communication of hazardous weather risks.  The research will bridge the gap between how spatially explicit storm surge information is being conveyed by scientists and their interpretation and use by members of the public in at-risk coastal communities. The investigators will consider the role of concepts such as space and place in data representation and hypothesize that connecting people to place through theoretically and empirically informed visualizations will enhance at-risk populations' understandings of and responses to storm surge hazard threats.  The project's research questions are: How do residents of coastal communities perceive a sense of place in their everyday lives and when hazardous storm surge threatens? How can sense of place constructs be integrated into visualization of storm surge threats? How do different ways of representing space and place in storm surge visualizations interact with people's understandings of and responses to the hazards? The investigators will use a multi-method interdisciplinary approach that employs an experimental participatory cognitive mapping process, research on and development of innovative storm surge visualizations, iterative focus groups on risk perception and the degree to which attachment to place factors in to decision-making, and an online survey to test the impact of different types of visualizations.  Together this suite of methods will be able to inform how the visualizations, attachment to place, and other factors influence people's understandings of and responses to storm surge hazards.  The research includes stakeholder engagement in coastal areas and experts from several related government agencies. Although the project focuses on coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the methods, technology, and visualization concepts will be relevant to other coastal communities in the U.S. vulnerable to hurricane storm surge. Furthermore, the theories and empirical findings will be relevant to non-coastal communities by understanding how attachment to place within visualizations can be used to improve communication of risk hazards and decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019
Jason,P,Briner,jbriner@buffalo.edu,SUNY at Buffalo,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,06/01/2019,11/30/2022,346915,Benchmarking Spatial Patterns of Glacier Change,"This research will investigate global patterns of past glacier advance and retreat to analyze regional patterns of environmental variability.  During times of global glacier recession, glaciers in different parts of the world behaved differently. The rate of glacier retreat varied through time, and in some cases, glacier retreat was interrupted by short intervals of glacier growth.  These differential spatial patterns can help scientists predict future patterns of regional response to global environmental variability.  In this project, using various earth science techniques, investigators will analyze glacial landforms in Alaska to affirm regional differences in rates of past glacier change.  Alaska is a region where past glacier change is less well understood than other parts of the world, but one where regional glacier change was different from global patterns.  Findings will contribute to an improved understanding of past regional environmental variability and thereby be an important data source for future modelling.  The project's broader impacts include the career advancement of a scientist from an underrepresented group and includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students. Dissemination will include academic publications and public-oriented materials disseminated via national parks and native communities in Alaska. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better understand the trajectory of future glacier change, and related environmental variability, better regional influences on glacier behavior across the planet must be elucidated. For this reason, detailed knowledge of regional glacier change and their deviations from the global pattern are critically needed for paleoclimate and glacial-geomorphology communities. Carbon dioxide changes during the last deglaciation were tightly coupled to mountain glacier change. Yet, this compilation lacked data from the high latitudes.  Recent research hypothesizes that carbon dioxide in modern times has overwhelmed regional drivers and has become the dominant control on glacier change. The proposed research aims address these ideas by filling in a key data gap.  The investigators will test two hypotheses that are at the forefront of paleoclimate and glacier science. (1) Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary forcing mechanism of mountain glacier change.  (2) Glaciers outside the North Atlantic region advanced during Heinrich stadials, but retreated prior to their terminations. The researchers will reconstruct a highly detailed mountain glacier record from the high northern latitudes, temporally spanning from the last deglaciation to the present. Because continental ice sheets covered most of the high northern latitudes during Ice Ages, there are few accessible sites that offer detailed glacier moraine sequences with materials that can be precisely dated.  Because Alaska remained largely untouched by continental sheets during the last glacial period and was instead dominated by mountain glaciers, this is an ideal location to benchmark and develop a record of glacier change since last deglaciation.  The PIs will combine cosmogenic Beryllium-10 dating of an exceptional moraine sequence in the Revelation Mountains in western Alaska with digital mapping and glacier equilibrium-line altitude analysis to test their hypotheses and to benchmark a regional record of mountain glacier change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This support will permit the committee to address how the geographical sciences contribute to societal well-being, security, and prosperity by highlighting issues that connect communities with geography, such as natural and human-induced hazards, population growth and change, and changes in physical and social infrastructure. Geographical science research can help address the interactions and feedbacks between humans and the physical environment for more informed decision-making and can contribute to strategies developed together with urban or rural planners, natural resource managers, and policy makers to address individual and community vulnerabilities in the places where people live. Support for the GSC will provide an immediate access point for federal agencies to engage with the geographical science community of practice and will provide the geographical sciences community with a direct interface to inform government and policy. The Geographical Sciences Committee brings emerging and relevant research to the forefront of decision-making, amplifying the intellectual merit of individual topics in a range of issues to increase societal impact. This award brings together different generations of researchers, including students and early-career professionals, for constructive dialogue at the interface of geographical science and policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As extreme weather events, hazards such as wildfires, and economic and population changes displace people from their homes and cause people to make critical decisions about where and how to live, challenges will exist to satisfy human health, energy, water, transportation, infrastructure, and other needs in ways that are safe and economically and environmentally viable. The core activities of this award will develop and oversee new activities to address human vulnerability to natural and human-induced hazards (such as wildland fire, particularly at the wildland-urban interface); to address questions related to changes in physical infrastructure and communities (such as coastal development and flood risk or energy transitions in rural regions); and to examine emerging fields of interest to the geographical sciences (such as access to volunteered geographic information or advances in geospatial data for commercial applications).  This award will address these questions by bringing a geographic perspective to these problems; by fostering cooperation among government, academia, industry, and other stakeholders; and by helping to ensure that the geographical sciences remain an important area of growth for the nation. Support for the GSC will enable the use of modes and methods of knowledge generation that converge around convening information and input from different constituencies. The activities of the award will generate new knowledge on the basis of dialogue, information exchange, and consensus. The award will also ensure that the information is shared with government, academic, non-governmental, industry, and public audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Cryptocurrency-backed initial coin offerings (ICOs) represent a novel form of venture financing that changes the scale and scope of investment as well as encouraging firm structures that maximize hospitable regulatory locations. The outcomes of these processes have important implications for the location of economic growth and wealth formation, particularly within the finance sector.  The project seeks to clarify how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector.  Findings will be disseminated via a variety of publications (academic and more general and using open access publishing), the distribution of  tools, code, and datasets developed for this project for gathering, cleaning and analyzing data via open-source tools and data such as GitHub, and through educational activities such as student training and classroom modules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contribution of this research is to demonstrate how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector. The research will advance theory and understanding within economic geography by looking specifically at financialization and the ways financial institutions and logics exert power in economic systems within these new spaces of finance.  The project has three specific objectives. The first is to determine the geographies of core cryptocurrency functions by asking: what factors contribute to the geographies of different cryptocurrency operations?  How are locations integrated with downstream operations such as ICOs? These questions will be answered using data-scraping and geolocation methods drawn from geospatial science and digital geographies. The second objective is to assesses how cryptocurrencies' uses and networks contribute to value. This will be addressed by using social network analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural nets from computational sociology and computer science to ask: how do networks of cryptocurrencies differ between use types? How does network interaction contribute to value? The third objective focuses on how cryptocurrencies affect financing and entrepreneurial practices within tech-based startups. The investigator will use interviews to gather data to answer: What are the motivations of investors/entrepreneurs in ICOs? and What additional functions are folded into the financing process?  Together these objectives will fundamentally advance basic knowledge in economic geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Ecosystem services are broadly defined as the benefits humans obtain from ecosystems and the services they provide. This research will investigate what institutions and policymakers are using the concept of ecosystem services and how this use differs from previous ways of conceptualizing the environment in policy. It will also explain the potential successes and failures of this new approach in improving environmental management. Understanding the important role that social and technical factors play in shaping these concepts and use in policy is important as payments for ecosystem services have been promoted as a solution to a variety of environmental problems. This research explores how ecosystem services are used in diverse policy settings, and how the translation of ecosystem functions into monetary valuation has evolved in different contexts. The project will benefit society by highlighting what types of policies are more effective in engaging stakeholders in more appropriate ways. The project will also strengthen social science research on environmental policy-making while building improved global scientific understanding among undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing attention to ecosystem services (ES) concepts, there remain major challenges regarding clarifying the values underlying the concept and translating it into policy. These challenges include identifying what counts as an ES, ranging from physical goods like timber to regulating services like soil erosion control to more intangible ""cultural ES""; how ES can be valued in ways that incorporate diverse viewpoints and understandings of nature; and how payments or compensation for provisioning of ES can be designed and delivered in ways that are socially beneficial. This research project will aim to answer two key research questions: (1) How are ES defined, measured, and prioritized by different actors in policymaking? (2) How are different ES turned into economic values and through what means, and why are some ES paid for, while others are not? The research project will use mixed methods, including focus groups, participatory mapping, and interviews to assess local understanding, use, and valuation of ES in three watershed-based case studies, as well as interviews with national and international policymakers and scientists to understand the uptake of ES concepts, culminating in the construction of an ES database. While this project will assess these questions using case studies from Southeast Asia, the findings are highly applicable outside the region, and can illuminate ways to improve environmental policy-making and ecosystem benefit sharing in the US and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Extreme heat is the most common weather-related cause of death. A better understanding of heat wave size, intensity and drivers of these characteristics will enhance public safety by identifying where and under what conditions heat waves are likely to be larger and/or more intense, so that public health interventions such as warnings, education, and staging of cooling/hydration stations, etc. can be planned. Novel integration of methods from climatology and landscape ecology will allow for development of a spatial database of heat waves that can be used to answer questions, such as how climate and land-surface change impacts heat wave size and intensity. Broader impacts of the project include implications for public health, urban planning, and disaster management and preparedness as well as land management and policy. Through workshops with heat-health stakeholders the project will promote dissemination of results and their translation into recommendations for public health and emergency management. The project has education and outreach activities designed to promote the inclusion of underrepresented groups and foster increased minority participation in geography and related STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the critical need to improve the spatial and temporal modeling of heat waves. Spatial analysis techniques from the fields of geography, landscape ecology, and climatology will be combined to examine the spatiotemporal evolution of heat waves. Heat waves will be tracked daily using a novel combination of simple geometric concepts, formalized as shape metrics, and a clustering algorithm. Regions within heat waves where conditions are expected to pose a significant risk to human and environmental health will be a key focus. Using statistical models and the concept of critical climate periods these regions will be linked to geophysical variables including atmospheric and land surface variables that influence surface air temperature and humidity. The two main research questions are: (1) what changes can be observed in spatiotemporal characteristics of heat waves, such as size and shape? and (2) what are the relationships among statistical characteristics of heat waves (frequency, magnitude, duration), spatial characteristics of heat waves (size, shape, connectivity), and geophysical variables?  The overarching goal of the project is to develop models to predict these heat wave characteristics.

The investigators will consider what specific socioeconomic conditions produced local ecological change doing this by comparing multiple centuries of written historical records documenting agriculture and land management with physical records of vegetation change reconstructed using sediments from nearby lakes. Combining ecologic data with historical texts permits identification of times when societal activities resulted in long-term environmental change. There is increasing recognition that modern ecosystems reflect the results of centuries of human and ecological processes. This project will offer insight into present-day decision makers charged with developing better strategies for responding to the challenges of living in a changing environment. The investigators will contribute to the advancement of science by applying a novel geochemical method to create a new and more detailed environmental history. The project includes a team of historians and physical scientists and will support the education of a graduate student and two McNair scholars. The McNair scholar program is a federal program for members of traditionally underrepresented groups in higher education to gain research skills and better prepare for a potential career in higher education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests the hypothesis that abrupt ecologic change is more closely associated with the history of human socioeconomic change than environmental change, and that these changes extend across broad geographic regions under the same governmental control. Ecologic change will be reconstructed using pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal analysis from radiocarbon dated lake sediment cores with very high sedimentation rates that allow for a decadal chronological resolution that can be compared with historical data. Historical narratives will come from extensive legal charters dating back to 650 AD. The investigators will also develop a new high-resolution precipitation reconstruction using a multi-method approach by analyzing oxygen and carbon isotopes from lake sediment carbonates and cellulose, analysis of hydrogen isotopes in leaf wax residues and testing whether carbon isotopes from pollen can be used as a precipitation proxy. This study will investigate this question by considering a case study near Lucca, Italy because this city preserved 1,300 years of charters and legal documents recording land use history across a critical transitional period from the Roman centralized taxation system, into a decentralized political and economic system, then to proto-capitalist city states and finally up to the modern society. The research will provide new insights and approaches to managers interested in increasing forest resilience in the United States by identifying past examples in which land management decisions were implemented under different socioeconomic structures, which resulted in altering land use practices and creating new ecologic states that in some cases led to permanent environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Hurricanes can impact a region by causing storm surge flooding related deposition along the coast as well as river flooding in inland areas due to heavy precipitation. Description and analysis of hurricane-induced present-day coastal and inland sediment deposits are vital for deciphering the origins of storm deposits and understanding the relative contribution of a variety of sedimentary processes in different environmental settings. By using multiple proxies, this study provides accurate descriptions of the storm deposits generated by a recent intense hurricane in both the coastal and inland environments. Results from this study provide critical information for identifying ancient storm deposits in the geological record, which advances the study of past hurricane activity in the context of environmental variability at timescales of centuries and millennia.  From this analysis of hurricane impacts in deeper time societal benefits are derived because long-term records of hurricane activity are vital for accurate risk assessment for present and future coastal communities. The project also provides educational and professional development opportunities for students and faculty at a minority-serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to assess key coastal and terrestrial environments along the path of a recent hurricane, Hurricane Maria in 2017, and to identify and characterize its coastal storm surge and inland river flood deposits. This research identifies prominent hurricane-induced sediment deposition in coastal and interior environments that sheds light on the severity and geographical variation of storm impacts in different geomorphological settings, thus offering a modern analog that assists the search for the evidence of ancient hurricanes in the geological record. Short cores to be collected from a few coastal lagoons and inland wetlands will be analyzed chronologically (using Pb-210 and Cs-137 radioisotopes), sedimentologically (using loss-on-ignition and grain-size analyses), geochemically (using X-ray fluorescence analysis), and micropaleontologically (using foraminifera and palynological analyses) to identify and characterize the Hurricane Maria deposits. Chemical elemental ratios (such as Cl/Br and Ca/Fe) and biological proxies (especially palynomorphs and foraminifera) will be used to differentiate the effects of freshwater flooding versus saltwater intrusion that represent two different types of environmental impacts. Although this research project will focus on Hurricane Maria related deposits in Puerto Rico, the research will provide new insights and approaches for identifying the coastal and inland environmental impacts of other intense storms in the continental U.S., which helps society better prepare for these extreme events in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The project demonstrates a new framework for analyzing urban water budgets that synergistically integrates qualitative analysis of knowledge, perceptions, and governance of water resources and infrastructures. This research will generate important new knowledge about how infrastructure-mediated flows (IMFs), including inter-basin transfers (IBTs) and the infiltration and inflow (I&amp;I) of rainfall and groundwater into sanitary sewer pipes, fundamentally alter the hydrology of watersheds. The research will reveal how these IMFs strain the capacity of wastewater treatment systems and evaluate how this new knowledge can enhance the effective governance of transboundary water resources. The broader societal impacts of this research include enhancing STEM education and the inclusion of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The project also includes a summer workshop with local K-12 teachers aimed at integrating concepts of urban hydrology and water governance into curriculum. The project provides research training for undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia State University, a national leader in supporting the educational accomplishments of underrepresented minority students, and elements of the project will be integrated into the curriculum for undergraduate and graduate courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. population is becoming increasingly urbanized, resulting in dramatic impacts on urban watersheds and contributing to multiscalar and transboundary water governance challenges. Water withdrawals for municipal consumption have increased greatly, often necessitating politically contentious inter-basin transfers of water. Aging water infrastructure is conducive to infiltration and inflow, whereby a high volume of water permeates sanitary-sewers through pipe fractures and discontinuities. This unnecessarily increases inflow to wastewater treatment plants, while reducing streamflow in local watersheds. Inter-basin transfers and infiltration and inflow remain difficult to quantify, resulting in disparate perceptions of their magnitude and importance. This project answers three fundamental questions about the magnitude, variability, and governance of infrastructure-mediated flows (IMFs) in urban watersheds: (1) how do IMFs impact urban watershed hydrology; (2) how are these impacts perceived and managed by governance authorities and stakeholders; and (3) how will governance decisions be impacted by improved hydrologic characterization of IMFs? The methodology includes a novel formulation of the urban water budget with explicit quantification of the impact of inter-basin transfers and infiltration and inflow. A possible solution is using data representing meteorological variables, potable water flows, sanitary sewer flows, and land-cover characteristics. These data are widely available and promote maximum transferability of the approach. The solution of the urban water budget will be informed by qualitative data gathered from utility managers and water resource stakeholders, thereby leveraging local expertise. The perceptions of IMFs, and responses to new knowledge about them, will be characterized through an iterative set of interviews with managers and stakeholders. Inferences will be made via qualitative-thematic analysis of interview transcripts and quantitative analysis of Likert-scale survey responses. The findings of this project will inform conceptualizations about urban water management and urban sustainability. To demonstrate the utility of this new method and approach, this study focuses on the South River Watershed within the broader Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, while the methodological approach and results are applicable across a broad array of urban watershed in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The research analyzes historic sites, specifically sites on the National Registrar of Historic Places (NRHP) which, as part of cultural memory, provide a rich window into how the U.S. frames its past. Understanding how the past is commemorated and represented in landscapes of memorialization is crucial to achieving public trust and civic participation as it provides an opportunity to engage with U.S. history, how this history has been represented, what such representations mean, and how these vary. Research products include a publicly available database of all non-restricted sites on the NRHP that denote relevant nation-building events between 1513 and 1898, an historical atlas, and an accessible website. Graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the project and are trained in interdisciplinary research that combines archival methods with field-based landscape analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research advances geographic scholarship by contributing to theory in historical geography, landscape studies, and related fields. The investigation first develops a database of all sites that denote relevant nation-building events between 1513 and 1898.  While scholars have written about specific sites and events, there has been no analysis of the practices across the entire country or connecting such sites to the formation of the U.S. nation through its historical geography. Although the study uses a regional approach, the project is a national level investigation and provides data on commemorative practices for all 50 states. Sites will be analyzed and coded according to which forms of memorialization are associated with the site and how those processes are represented in the nomination materials. Not only will the study illuminate the diverse ways that memorialization is represented, it also highlights how the landscape is used in this process. Although this study is focused on the historical geography of the U.S., its underlying conception can be applied to many places, ensuring the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the proposed methodology, with minor modifications, offers a rigorous and robust way of analyzing cultural memory in any locale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Rapid advances in AI methods, the proliferation of spatial big data, and immense computing power are transforming the way research is conducted and prompts new discoveries. This project develops a new Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) solution to enable large-scale, automated, intelligent, and highly accurate landform feature detection and terrain analysis. Conventional approaches to terrain analysis have been limited to the use of pixel/object-based image analysis and shallow machine learning, which suffer from significant performance challenges when dealing with big data in complex classification tasks. This research, which spatializes deep (machine) learning by incorporating spatial principles and spatial relational data, represents a methodological breakthrough in GeoAI and spatial data science more broadly. Leveraging GeoAI for landform feature recognition enriches spatial knowledge and enhances the understanding of land-surface processes on Earth and other planets. It also benefits geospatial applications that have societal benefit, including anomaly detection that can be used in search and rescue operations and by recognizing landform features indicative of environmental change. The investigators intend on developing the GeoAI community using the model used to establish the Geographic Information Science (GISci) community in the past. GeoAI-related symposia will be organized to serve as an important venue for researchers from diverse disciplines and organizations to discuss new advances and open challenges in GeoAI. The project includes a postdoctoral scholar and trains undergraduate students as interdisciplinary scientists. Both investigators are female scientists and they actively mentor scientists from underrepresented groups. All data and code developed during this project will be open-sourced to benefit the broader geospatial community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant challenges exist in successfully applying GeoAI to terrain analysis, including the complexity and diversity in landform features, the dearth of training data, the lack of spatial knowledge in model design, and the limited understanding of machine inferential processes. This research will tackle such challenges by developing (1) a comprehensive terrain dataset GeoNat to support terrain analysis and various machine learning tasks; (2) a machine learning model TerrainAI that injects key spatial principles (spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity) to enable cross-scale deep learning from multi-source, georeferenced data; and (3) an interactive visualization tool that opens up the ""black box"" of the machine's learning and decision process. Relying on these tools, three research questions will be answered: (I) What are the unique spatial structures, patterns, and spatial scale that a machine learns to differentiate landform features? (II) How do human and machine recognition processes compare? And (III) How can the underlying geomorphological processes that yield certain forms of a feature in different landscapes be predicted? The identification of process-form relationships significantly impacts the agenda of geographical, spatial scientific and related sciences such as geomorphology in fostering the creation of a community-consensus landform classification system. The TerrainAI model is not limited to the study of landforms but is generalizable and applicable to detect any geographical objects, both natural and human-made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Ocean thermal expansion (due to increasing ocean temperatures) and mountain glacier ice loss (due to increased glacier melt rates) have contributed most to global mean sea level rise (SLR) and are expected to continue to dominate SLR over at least the coming century. Unfortunately, the uncertainties in recent glacier contributions to SLR and current volume of glacier ice remain high due, in part, to limited data on glacier volume changes. The improved estimates of historical glacier changes and current glacier volume from this project will provide a critical step towards assessing changes in SLR, quantifying glacier sensitivity to environmental variability, and providing accurate projections of future SLR and its associated societal impacts.  This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will also develop educational lab kits for K-12 classrooms. These kits will communicate the results of this research to school teachers and students, while simultaneously providing hands-on, real world, geographical and spatial science exercises.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will quantify regional glacier volume/mass changes over the past approximately 150 years to significantly improve the spatial and temporal estimates of glacier changes and the associated contributions to SLR.  Investigators will include all mountain glaciers and ice caps across the globe in their analysis.  The investigators will also quantify the current spatial distribution of volume of glacier ice using observations from the initial phase of the research to constrain a glacier model.  This will be accomplished using a combination of techniques (automated cloud characterization schemes, NDSI, photogrammetry, photoclinometry) applied to a suite of remotely sensed data and historical imagery to map glacier area and volume changes over the past several decades.  The investigators will use this information to constrain spatially-varying scale factors for a glacier volume-area scaling model. This work will extend back in time to the Little Ice Age (LIA) by compiling reliable moraine dates and maps, and automated mapping of LIA moraines.  The volume of ice around the end of the LIA will be calculated, which will permit placing the spatial and temporal patterns in glacier volume change into context relevant to assess anthropogenic changes. These new glacier volume and volume change estimates will be used to estimate regional patterns of past and future contributions of glaciers to SLR and identify specific regions where glacier changes and contributions to future SLR are likely to be significant. Thus, this research project will focus on glacier contribution to SLR globally and will provide new insights estimating the impacts of SLR in many countries, including the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This research will explore the impacts of drought in order to improve management efforts to mitigate conifer die-back and wildfire risk. Since 2010, over 52 million hectares of trees have died in California's forests due to climate change, drought, and drought-induced disturbances such as wildfire. Forest loss and wildfire trends have important implications for the health, safety, and well-being of communities in both urban and rural areas throughout the American West. The effects of how competition, species, and habitat interact geographically to influence tree responses to drought will be studied across six conifer species. This research will benefit society by providing valuable input data for potential fire risk modeling. The project will also mentor young scientists at an undergraduate institution. It will provide knowledge to land managers and regional tribes through public and educational outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use the recent drought as a natural experiment to investigate conifer responses within diverse species' biogeographic distributions. The project will examine 1) how competition, species, and habitat interact to influence tree responses to drought, and 2) how drought resistance varies among diverse conifer species after years of severe drought. This study uses multiple measures of tree response for common and uncommon conifer species. This research will advance the geographic literature on forest drought responses, while also providing opportunities for students to work with an interdisciplinary research team. This study, focused in northern California and southern Oregon, will provide essential information about the potential impacts of ongoing drought to forest species in a biodiverse and culturally important region of the Pacific West. As forest mortality and drought are not issues unique to this region, findings from this work will benefit management efforts in many forest ecosystems, with implications for fire risk, human health and well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This research arena is an important theoretical and methodological marketplace where geneticists, biological anthropologists, paleoecologists, and archaeologists work to explain the process of global human dispersal. This is especially the case in the Americas, where genetic models predict that humans of the late Ice Age rapidly filled the Western Hemisphere, originating in greater Northeast Asia, spreading to Alaska, and reaching the Southern Cone of South America, between 24,000 and 12,000 calendar years ago. Archaeological evidence is required from these scattered regions to empirically test the genetic-based theory of how early hunter-gatherers dispersed. One of the most visible components of the archaeological record is the variable forms of weapons and projectile points that prehistoric hunters across northern Asia and America used, specifically stone lanceolate points versus bone/antler/ivory points, the latter sometimes inset with stone microblades. The functional, environmental, and social factors that influenced these weapon designs remain unknown. Why did ancient foragers of Siberia and Alaska employ different weapon systems as they entered the Americas? How did these variable weapons facilitate settlement of every ecological niche in the Western Hemisphere? The new research will offer insight into the use of major projectile-point technologies and human decision-making processes as early Americans dispersed through different environments, at the end of the Ice Age when dramatic climatic and ecological changes were taking place, broadening knowledge of human adaptability, especially in northern landscapes. The international context of the research will foster relationships between a new generation of American, Canadian, and Russian archaeologists investigating human behavioral change and adaptation in the circumpolar Arctic. The project will engage Alaskan Native communities through educational demonstrations of projectile systems traditionally used in subsistence activities, promoting positive relationships between archaeologists and the public. Understanding the functions of these important artifacts will help sustain traditional subsistence practices among Native Alaskans and will help reveal the reasons for ancient assemblage differences and ultimately how these differences relate to the colonization of Beringia and the Americas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joshua Lynch, PhD candidate at Texas A&amp;M University, will examine variability in projectile technologies Ice Age Siberia and Beringia by examining the range of morphological and functional variation in lithic, osseous, and composite points to test hypotheses explaining why different projectile technologies co-occur in the early archaeological record of the far north. This will be achieved through a series of experiments employing projectiles reflective of archaeological examples used in three different weapon systems (hand-thrust spear, bow and arrow, and spear thrower) to generate a new standard of breakage and use-wear patterns for ancient weapon technologies. By establishing the functions of specific point forms, project results will improve interpretations of Ice Age archaeological assemblage variability as it relates to foraging behavior, landscape use, site function, and cultural variability. Further, macro- and microscopic analyses of projectile points from more than 40 pivotal Siberian and Alaskan archaeological sites will be conducted and compared to the results of the experimental testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

While there have been many studies on political identity and conservation, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the intersection of complex identities and conservation. Some traditional groups in the Americas, for instance, claim both Black and indigenous political identities simultaneously. Such communities often predate the countries in which they now exist, many occupying areas historically assumed to be uninhabitable. Such groups also face land insecurity, while at the same time playing an important role in conservation. Understanding the political identities, territorial claims, and ecological knowledge of these distinct communities has important implications for the creation and management of protected natural areas. The research findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, academic publications, and stakeholder meetings. Results will be communicated through written policy statements and recommendations to government offices, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and local stakeholders. As a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research uses a comparative case study approach, analyzing and comparing the experiences of two Maroon settlements, African-descended peoples who also claim indigenous status. Both communities are located in forested areas of Jamaica, with different levels of environmental protection and state governance. This research has three objectives: 1) identify how Maroons describe and interpret their identity to negotiate claims on territory and protected area management; 2) identify how state officials describe and interpret Maroon identity, claims on territory, and protected area management; and 3) identify ways tensions between diverse stakeholders are resolved. The doctoral student will employ a range of qualitative methods, including: semi-structured key informant interviews; participant observation; and collection and analysis of archival documents (survey reports, environmental management plans, policy papers, and maps). These methods will be complemented by collaboration and affiliation with local communities and environmental non-governmental organizations.

Savannas and prairies cover a fifth of Earth's land surface, are home to over a half a billion people, and disproportionately affect interannual variability of the global carbon cycle. Yet, there is limited understanding of the factors that create and maintain the low woody cover (trees and bushes) of savannas. For decades, researchers have clearly documented how large herbivores suppress local savanna woody cover, while the large-scale effects continue to remain unclear. By quantifying a large herbivore's ecosystem-wide impacts, this dissertation will enhance understanding of the factors shaping savannas and their influence on global climate. Such understanding is critical for large herbivore conservation worldwide. The work will establish a field site that will benefit the early academic careers of the researchers and create a collaborative partnership with an established savanna researcher. The project will build capacity through a student internship and a week-long programming course for students and faculty. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite decades of research, the scientific understanding of the determinants of woody cover in savannas and prairies lags behind that of other biomes. To this end, a growing number of site-specific studies have found that tree mortality rates in some protected areas are principally controlled by large herbivores. However, it is not known whether these impacts significantly affect the total woody cover of the larger landscapes and region. If they do, it will lend significant support to the growing argument that biome extent and persistence can be a direct product of herbivory. This project focuses on quantifying the relationship between African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) densities and savanna woody cover in twelve protected areas across elephants' eastern African range. It then asks whether elephants' impacts  alter global climate. To answer these questions, the researchers used satellite imagery to map the woody cover in each of the study sites. NSF funding will be used to assess the accuracy of the maps through the collection of ground truth data at a select site. By incorporating the data into a global network, with plans to monitor the field site into the future, the researchers will establish important baseline data which will be made available to researchers for future studies. Globally, the world's megafauna populations continue to decline and the ecosystems, national revenues, and local livelihoods they support face detrimental consequences. Although this research project will focus on savanna ecosystems in eastern Africa, the research will provide new insights and approaches for megaherbivore conservation in many other countries, including the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Participants in the workshop will develop the concept of ""biological normalcy"" by using a series of case studies to understand the relationships between statistical norms for, and normative social views of, biological variation within human populations, and the broader implications of these relationships. By bringing to light the normative (and often ethno-biocentric) language used to describe human biological variation, the goal of the workshop is to expose and reduce bias in discourse about biological variation and develop new ways of describing it. The language used to describe human variation has direct relevance to clinical and public health, where treatments and policies may be aimed at ""normalizing""  biological measures that are viewed as ""non-normal,"" deviant, or pathological. To maximize the impact of this workshop, time during the final phase will be dedicated to developing dissemination plans for each participant and the group, with an emphasis on academic, applied, and public outreach that will emphasize communication and education as well as public engagement.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological normalcy serves as a conceptual framework to better understand and describe human biological variation from a biocultural perspective.  The outcomes of this workshop will advance biocultural research in anthropology by elaborating this framework, which emphasizes the bidirectional relationships between biology and culture. Over the past twenty-five years biocultural anthropologists have learned much about how social or cultural factors influence biology, but relatively little about how the distribution of biological traits in a population influence social norms.  Using the biological normalcy framework, the two meanings of normal are untangled, revealing the relationships between the two, and the ways that ethno-biocentric views may exist in discourse about human biological variation are exposed. The workshop is structured as a three day intensive session, with each day having a mix of individual presentations, group discussion, and small group research. Participants will focus on the causes and consequences of relationships between statistical norms and normative views, with each providing material on specific biological or biobehavioral traits (such as growth, body proportions, sleep, diet, among others), and investigate the ways that ethno-biocentric views may exist in discourse about these traits and their variability within and across populations.

Specifically, the research will focus on the ways in which surviving trees interact with the landscape to provide external seed sources for a burned area's recovery.  Recent studies used only a limited measurement of straight-line distance to nearest tree seed source, which does not fully consider scale, pattern, or interactions with local site suitability for area recovery.  Consequently, there is a knowledge gap regarding an understanding of how a burned area's surrounding context in the landscape supports or reduces its recovery potential (spatial resilience).  Project findings will contribute to the development of approaches that better account for landscape context in a world where wildfires are becoming more severe and occurring more frequently.  Given these changes, land managers must make decisions about which burned areas need to be actively replanted following wildfire activity versus areas that exhibit higher natural spatial resilience.  Prioritizing burned areas in the context of their position in the landscape could be fundamental to this decision-making.  To aid with decision-making, research findings will be disseminated as a decision-tree product to local and regional forest managers.  Furthermore, the project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate students by involving them in fieldwork and by developing workshops that engage K-12 girls with geography and spatial sciences.  Finally, the project will support a female doctoral student, further broadening participation of women and underrepresented groups in geography and spatial sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying the spatial scales at which landscape context is important for a burned forest's recovery is an important first-step in a holistic understanding of forest resilience and recovery.  However, scale-dependent effects are often species-specific, thus identifying relevant scales must account for divergent tree traits and interactions with local site suitability for tree growth.  To do so, the doctoral student asks three research questions: (1) What spatial extents and patterns of landscape context support a burned area's recovery? (2) How does landscape context interact with local site characteristics of recovering areas? (3) At broader temporal and spatial extents, will landscape context mediate resilience of forest ecosystem services in drier, more fire prone landscapes?  These questions will be answered using statistical modeling and fieldwork-generated data from a natural experiment in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.  The natural experimental landscape includes fires that represent a gradient of burn patterns and post-fire climate conditions in a similar geophysical setting, thereby providing a unique opportunity to observe the effects of landscape context on different burned areas' recovery.  Additionally, the investigator will use a spatially explicit ecosystem process model to investigate how landscape context at broader temporal and spatial scales support carbon storage and tree biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

When individuals take turns cooperating in a reciprocal fashion, they are better off in the long-term than individuals who care only about their own immediate benefit. However, little is known about the psychological skills needed. What features of the human mind enable us to engage in reciprocity? How can we explain when individuals are more or less cooperative? This project is focused on three psychological abilities that are hypothesized to be critical for reciprocity: The ability to plan for the future, to exercise patience, and to tolerate a level of risk. Measuring these abilities will facilitate understanding fundamental aspects of human cooperation and developing strategies needed to foster cooperation in daily social interactions, including the work environment. This project will examine reciprocity as it first emerges in development (by studying children), it will also examine reciprocity within the context of human evolution (by comparing human abilities to those of chimpanzees). To assess why some individuals are more cooperative than others, the project tests individual differences in reciprocal behavior across adults. An important aspect of this research project is to translate the insights about the basic skills for reciprocity into programs that foster cooperation in society-at-large. In business, practitioners have come to realize the need for more cooperative approaches and are in urgent need of guidelines to promote cooperative work in organizations; therefore, the researchers will partner with the Institute for Collaborative Working, an organization that develops executive training for collaborative working in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a battery of validated tests to determine the degree to which future planning, patience, and risk tolerance are the foundational skills required for reciprocity-based cooperation. The project will integrate three complementary lines of inquiry. One line will assess the evolutionary basis of the human capacity for reciprocity by studying chimpanzees as one of humans? closest primate relatives. This will test the hypothesis that chimpanzees reciprocate in limited ways because of differences in future planning, patience, and risk tolerance. A second line of inquiry will trace the emergence of reciprocity in children between 3 and 6 years of age. This will enable the researchers to test whether the emergence of reciprocity can be explained by developmental changes in the three component abilities. A third line involves experiments designed to examine individual differences among human adults in their tendency to engage in reciprocal cooperation -- measuring whether variability in reciprocity can be explained by differences in future planning, patience, and risk tolerance. Researchers will meet with key members of the Institute for Collaborative Working and international scholars to discuss the findings and their implications for fostering cooperative interactions in the work place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Early research typically treated technology as applied science with a predetermined developmental trajectory that predicted specific outcomes. Recent work contradicts this, suggesting that technologies and their structures are the result of complex social dynamics between producers, consumers, and other members of a society with a vested interest, often leading to conflict, cooperation, and compromise. These interactions produce unique and materially traceable patterns of specialization, organization, and consumption. Archaeology, with a material dataset spanning millennia, is well suited to studying the material aspects of these phenomena. When supported by ancient textual records, as in the case of the present research, it is also possible to investigate the social dynamics behind the material record, allowing researchers to look at the tension between what people say (texts) and do (material remains), which often reveals information about social ideals and the limits of power. Over the long-term, how do different societies come to terms with new and complex technological suites? Today, as societies grapple with the unforeseen consequences of technologies like the internet, labor automation, and machine learning, the importance of this question is clear - new technologies often do not have straightforward and predictable effects, and different groups, based on their unique priorities, will structure them differently and use them to meet a wide variety of goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Johnson and his collaborators will examine how metallurgical technologies were practiced, managed, and perceived during a crucial transformative period where metallurgy underwent a shift from a small-scale elite craft to a complex industry that facilitated the development of wealth-based economies and increased productive capacity, thereby laying part of the foundation for the formation of large territorial empires. Working with material scientists, geologists, and archaeologists, Mr. Johnson will utilize methods developed in the STEM disciplines to analyze metallurgical debris excavated from the ancient city of Alalakh in southern Turkey. As the capital of a small state with a diverse economic base that was frequently subservient to much larger regional powers, Alalakh is an ideal setting for studying these developments. Through these analyses, the researchers will develop a comprehensive assessment of metallurgical technologies in use over a 400-year period (1600-1200 BC), during which the production of iron was mastered and the manufacture of copper reached a truly industrial scale. Considered in reference to local and regional textual records and their archaeological contexts, the evaluation of these data will permit a thorough assessment of changing methods of production, management, and consumption at a local level and how these trends supported broader social developments. Using a robust interdisciplinary program, Mr. Johnson and colleagues will generate a more thorough protocol for the integration of STEM and humanities datasets, while the international nature of the collaboration with create a valuable venue for cross-cultural teaching and exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

While time is generally understood in terms of quantifiable units such as hours, days, months and years, recent scholarship has highlighted that human experiences of time are diverse, and rooted in activities rather than objective measurements. As a discipline that tracks long-term processes of continuity and change, archaeology is particularly well-suited to tracing the rhythms and durations of a range of activities, everyday acts of cooking and consumption as well as events like death and commemoration. Further, archaeological studies emphasize how relationships between people and the material world - landscapes, monuments and objects - influence how people and societies form a sense of history, and develop their collective memory. These complex experiences of time have been significant historically and remain important in today's world, as seen in disputed claims to heritage, debates over the repatriation of museum objects, and a widespread interest in documenting and preserving traditional practices. Researchers collaborate with scholars and government officials in India to train students and produce knowledge about the past that is disseminated to both academic and non-academic audiences. Additionally, this team of researchers will collaborate with local authorities to create a museum with finds excavated at Maski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shifting the focus from meaningful monuments to the sphere of everyday life, the research will study how the production and use of ceramic vessels shaped the rhythms of household activities in medieval south India.

While the study of ADE has demonstrated its importance in the development of complex societies before the arrival of Europeans, there have yet to be any significant studies concerning the transformations of ADE during European colonization of the Amazon. Researchers will collect and analyze samples of ADE soils at the Carrazedo site, located at the confluence of the Xingu and Amazon Rivers, to examine the processes and causes behind transformations of ADE between precolonial, colonial, and modern occupations of the site. This study will provide ecological and anthropological knowledge concerning both the transformations of ADE soils and the political economies associated with their production. The rupture caused by colonialism in this region presents an ideal opportunity to identify the ways in which ADE production, which was originally geared towards subsistence agriculture, transformed to meet the needs of emerging capitalism. Within the Carrazedo community, this project will help to foster greater appreciation of the community's archaeological past, will provide incentive to protect the archaeological site from future development, will contribute to the development of a community-based tourism project at the site, and will provide archaeological training to both community members and undergraduate students. The project also holds great potential towards the ongoing development of productive, yet sustainable strategies for rural agriculture in the Amazon. As the project fine tunes the analyses of the complexities of ADE variability, farming communities may harness this knowledge and benefit from the greater production that high fertility levels of ADE have to offer. Opportunities for less deforestation and greater carbon sequestration also make the study of ADE an important avenue for greater sustainability in the Amazon.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Researchers of this project will address questions concerning the chemical, physical, and cultural variability of ADE between precolonial, colonial and modern occupations of the site. Specifically, this study will seek to understand both the intentionality behind ADE production, and the transformation of this traditional ecological knowledge over time. Were these soils being reproduced after the arrival of Europeans? Or were the techniques and knowledge of ADE production lost as a result of colonialism? This study will answer these questions by conducting excavations and collecting soil samples within various activity areas that cover a broad spatial and temporal scope of the site with the intention of understanding the incremental and systematic changes to ADE. Once collected, these samples will be analyzed in order to understand their chemical, physical, and cultural components. These results will then be integrated with findings from archival research in order to gain insight to the nature of historic strategies for agricultural production and community patterning in the greater Xingu-Amazon region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Interactions among prehistoric populations are widely recognized as processes that ignited cultural change and had far-reaching consequences influencing the spread of languages, religion, technology, sociopolitical organizations, economic patterns and human demography. Some of the most profound impacts occurred when prehistoric food producing (farmers and herders) populations spread and migrated into new areas where they encountered indigenous hunter-gatherer's or foragers who did not produce food. Interactions among populations can take many different forms, from complete assimilation to competitive exclusion. Interactions can also result in the formation of cooperative interrelationships in which both groups maintain their ethnic identities but regularly interact in ways that are mutually beneficial (also called mutualism). Mutualistic interactions are well-known among contemporary foragers and food producers but are difficult to explain with current knowledge. Previous scholarship focused largely on economic exchange as the driving force behind these interactions, but observations show that these interrelationships are very complicated and have economic, social and nutritional benefits for the participants. The question faced by researchers now is why some population interactions result in the establishment of mutualistic interrelationships and others do not? An equally important question concerns how archeologists might recognize similar kinds of cooperative arrangements in the archaeological record? Ethnoarchaeology, which uses anthropological methods to identify the material traces of different behavioral processes, is uniquely situated to investigate all of these questions.  This research project will help build scholarly capacity by providing ethnoarchaeological training to Central African researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international team of researchers from the United States and Central African Republic will use ethnoarchaeological methods to study cooperative mutualistic interactions among foragers and food producers in the Central African rainforest, one of the last remaining areas in the world where these interrelationships persist. The team will collect information on how these interactions are maintained through observations and interviews with foragers and farmers.  The team will also collect information on the material traces that result from these interactions and that can serve as a framework for identifying mutualistic interactions in the archeological record. These include biomarkers of diet and nutritional health from hair samples and proxy measurements of economic and social interactions through the contents of faunal records and household inventories. This interdisciplinary project will create a unique intersecting dataset that documents how mutualistic interactions work and are reflected in the material record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Recent work in archaeology reveals the many ways that humans use ""foreign-made"" objects to forge meaningful social identities. Yet this focus on identity tends to downplay important economic interdependencies between production and consumption. Researchers will analyze the archaeological remains of shell bead manufacturing centers New Jersey between 1750 and 1900 CE. At these sites, Euro-Americans produced shell beads for export to Native American consumers on the Great Plains. How did interactions on the borders of an expanding American state impact industrialization in New Jersey? What factors led to the successes and failures of making and selling products to indigenous consumers? And how did Native consumers use Jersey-made beads to achieve their own social and political goals? Today, much of the American manufacturing sector relies on the tastes of consumers who live outside the country's boundaries. The forces that drive industry - and the success or struggles of workers - are often tied to distant political and cultural factors beyond the immediate understanding of producers. By investigating the effects of state policies on the fortunes of both early American industrialists and Native nations, this research offers key insights into the relationship between the economy, state policy, and international affairs. The archaeological excavations conducted by this project will provide opportunities for student training in scientific methods of archaeology. Researchers will engage publically with community stakeholders through local historical societies and the New Jersey State Museum in an effort to show how a local American industry was intimately tied to indigenous cultures, economies, and conflicts on the Great Plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will examine changes over time between production and consumption in order to determine the factors that influenced the rise and fall of an American industry. Shell beads have been made in North America for thousands of years, but by the American Revolution, Irish and Dutch settlers in northern New Jersey became the major exporters of beads for the fur trade. Combined with analysis of existing museum collections, excavations in New Jersey will target ""proto-industrial"" and ""industrial"" shell bead manufacturing sites to gather archaeological data in the form of debris, waste, bead blanks, tools, and finished beads. These will be examined along with historical accounts, factory ledgers, and fur trade records to track elements of ""industrialization"" such as efficiencies, technologies, standardization, and scale of output. Archaeological, historical, ethnographic, and portraiture data will be used to track broad regional trends in Native uses of shell beads throughout the 19th century.

Its study also contributes to our appreciation of how language change proceeds more generally.  Tibeto-Burman, along with the Sinitic or Chinese languages, constitutes the larger Sino-Tibetan family, including hundreds of languages stretching from Pakistan to the Pacific. Most of these languages have no written record.

Tremendous variation occurs cross-linguistically in terms of the different linguistic means by which speakers convey their own perspective on a segment of reported speech, including the extent to which speakers agree or disagree with it in content or tone. The notion of ""perspective shift"" is not only an area of linguistic significance, but is also important to theories of cognition, but considerable gaps in our knowledge of these processes exist. This project seeks to addresses some of those gaps to advance a better understanding of perspective in linguistic theory and cognition through analysis of an endangered language of Ecuador, A'ingae, which employs a typologically unique mechanism to signal perspective shift by producing a word that is unusually or unnaturally high, known as falsetto.  The project will create a diverse collection of narratives useful for future scientific and cultural endeavors, as well as innovative methodological advances like digital animation and interactive board games to examine language use in context.  Broader impacts also include the training of undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups at two US universities in scientific research methods, technical skills like digital animation, as well as hands-on experience working with diverse groups of stakeholders in an international collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of perspective shift within discourse and sentences is one of the most important areas of semantics and pragmatics research, and it is one where the study of indigenous and endangered languages has proven especially crucial. This project explores these issues through the documentation of an understudied language whose grammar allows for the explicit expression of perspective shift of a sort which is implicit in English and other more well-studied languages. The perspective-shifting use of falsetto in A'ingae (CON), a linguistic isolate of Ecuador, can co-occur with other reported speech devices in the language including lexical verbs like ""say"" and ""tell"", as well as reportative and quotative clitics. To understand more precisely the kind of perspective shift that falsetto in A'ingae encodes, the project will analyze the broader domain of reported speech and perspective-taking through the collaborative creation of an annotated digital corpus of naturalistic speech and careful consideration of how these devices impact deictic and other perspective-sensitive elements with which they co-occur. Specifically, speakers produce a single syllable of falsetto in order to indicate shifts between different perspectives in discourse, a shift that is largely or entirely implicit in other languages, thereby shedding light on perspective-taking processes which are often quite difficult to observe in other languages. This project, in addition to creating important documentary materials and linguistic training opportunities, will provide important insights on the rich techniques that speakers use to signal perspective taking and perspective shifting. The issues impact many areas of semantics and pragmatics and this theoretical focus dove-tails naturally with broad coverage language documentation, as perspective-taking can be studied only in rich and diverse discourse contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

While there are centuries of such records for Indo-European languages like English, this is not the case for all languages. The study of language change informs, confirms, or disputes theories of population movement and contacts--that is, it provides insights into prehistory. Its study also contributes to our appreciation of how language change proceeds more generally.  Tibeto-Burman, along with the Sinitic or Chinese languages, constitutes the larger Sino-Tibetan family, including hundreds of languages stretching from Pakistan to the Pacific. Most of these languages have no written record. This award will investigate as many as six Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in Chin State, Myanmar, which up to now have only been recorded in fragmentary wordlists. This project will expand our understanding of: development of tone and other aspects of tonal phenomena; sound changes and the position of these languages in the larger Tibeto-Burman language family; the grammatical behavior of nouns and verbs. Broader impacts include the mentoring of a junior faculty member and a graduate student at a Hispanic-Serving Institution; undergraduate training; capacity-building in linguistics and language documentation in Myanmar, and materials support for community language preservation and revitalization goals. This project has the potential to act as ""soft power"" in the region, strengthening U.S.-Myanmar engagement and empowering local communities, both of which are important U.S. State Department objectives. Materials collected under the project will be archived with the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By careful investigation and analysis of the structure of verbal complexes (verbs plus specific meaningful elements associated with them) for the languages in question, the investigators will test the extent to which understanding these structures contributes to a proper classification of languages with respect to related languages. Previous attempts to classify languages are based primarily on developments of specific sounds in individual words, a method which often fails to provide unambiguous classification; the current project will place greater emphasis on the consideration of specific grammatical phenomena for purposes of classification. Access to Chin State has been highly restricted for the last several decades, preventing fuller data collection which would illuminate the languages' history. Currently, there is a window of opportunity for access to the region by foreign scholars. This collaborative project pairs a PI with extensive experience running language documentation projects in neighboring countries, and a PI who is himself originally from Chin State, a cultural insider. Both PIs are established specialists in the languages of Chin State and the adjacent areas of Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, as of 2017, 70% of CHamoru speakers are currently over 55 years of age and less than 5% are younger than 30 years of age. The language is no longer being transmitted inter-generationally. Complicated features of the language and unique cultural knowledge and practices are being lost. Most of these features and practices are undocumented, including the use of specialized language for traditional practices. Since these parts of the language are sparsely documented, this knowledge repository is exclusively held in the minds of older speakers. In addition, the indigenous CHamoru people, along with other Pacific Islanders, face major disparities in educational advancement and are underrepresented in all of the sciences quite significantly.  This project seeks to address both the scientific and educational challenges. This project will document the expanse of CHamoru knowledge and produce a lasting record of this knowledge, simultaneously useful for scholars and the CHamoru community itself. This archive of recordings (audio and video) will be the only one of its kind on CHamoru and will facilitate further scholarship on the language. Broader impacts include broadening participation of underrepresented U.S. citizens in the social sciences, specifically linguistics. The data will be archived at Kaipuleohone UH Digital Language Archive at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, as well as archived at the Micronesian Area Research Center (MARC) on Guam to develop a local repository. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Developing CHamoru Language Infrastructure: Goggue Yan Chachalani Mo'na I Fino'-ta [Embrace and Make a Way Forward for Our Language] seeks to provide an in-depth understanding of the underpinnings of the CHamoru language as spoken by remaining first language speakers and to develop a cadre of language documenters drawn from university students and language educators in Guam. Carefully selected first language speakers, who are acknowledged experts, will identify traditional terms and cultural practices related to five specific cultural areas (fishing, agricultural, spirituality, medicinal plants, and artisanal crafts). The first language speakers will also be asked to produce speech samples in open-ended and guided interviews to document unique linguistic features which are rapidly disappearing or significantly altered in second language speakers. These include intonation, vowel harmony, consonant assimilation, derivational affixation, and use of CHamoru's focus system. This project will develop a repository of marked and tagged interviews and elicitations.

Tremendous variation occurs cross-linguistically in terms of the different linguistic means by which speakers convey their own perspective on a segment of reported speech, including the extent to which speakers agree or disagree with it in content or tone. The notion of ""perspective shift"" is not only an area of linguistic significance, but is also important to theories of cognition, but considerable gaps in our knowledge of these processes exist. This project seeks to addresses some of those gaps to advance a better understanding of perspective in linguistic theory and cognition through analysis of an endangered language of Ecuador, A'ingae, which employs a typologically unique mechanism to signal perspective shift by producing a word that is unusually or unnaturally high, known as falsetto.  The project will create a diverse collection of narratives useful for future scientific and cultural endeavors, as well as innovative methodological advances like digital animation and interactive board games to examine language use in context.  Broader impacts also include the training of undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups at two US universities in scientific research methods, technical skills like digital animation, as well as hands-on experience working with diverse groups of stakeholders in an international collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of perspective shift within discourse and sentences is one of the most important areas of semantics and pragmatics research, and it is one where the study of indigenous and endangered languages has proven especially crucial. This project explores these issues through the documentation of an understudied language whose grammar allows for the explicit expression of perspective shift of a sort which is implicit in English and other more well-studied languages. The perspective-shifting use of falsetto in A'ingae (CON), a linguistic isolate of Ecuador, can co-occur with other reported speech devices in the language including lexical verbs like ""say"" and ""tell"", as well as reportative and quotative clitics. To understand more precisely the kind of perspective shift that falsetto in A'ingae encodes, the project will analyze the broader domain of reported speech and perspective-taking through the collaborative creation of an annotated digital corpus of naturalistic speech and careful consideration of how these devices impact deictic and other perspective-sensitive elements with which they co-occur.

The Jicarilla Apache language, a Native American language of the Southwestern U.S., is known to be endangered. With the loss of their heritage language, the community's customs and traditional practices are equally endangered. This project is designed to address both linguistic and cultural knowledge by developing new transcriptions and translations of Jicarilla Apache texts gathered in the 1890s to 1930s by James R. Mooney, Pliny A. Goddard, and others.  A team of native-speaking Jicarilla Apache elders will undertake the process of examining the texts, retranscribing them into accurate Jicarilla Apache, and then translating them, both in English and Apache. Scientific understanding, based on materials collected in earlier decades by Western academics from indigenous language speakers underwent changes. Translations and interpretations were unduly influenced by Western perspectives and prioritizing academic audiences; this process of essentially multiple ""translations"" did not always capture accurately the intent of fluent speakers in Jicarilla Apache and other indigenous languages.  Misunderstandings may also have been introduced through imperfect translation into English. Revisiting this challenge, project activities will achieve greater linguistic and cultural accuracy for a key set of texts and associated traditional knowledge. The community-based efforts for documentation of the Jicarilla language are designed to foster inclusion and training of both learners and fluent speakers. Community youth will receive an introduction to the Jicarilla language and to the study of anthropological linguistics, in addition to an introduction to the computational methods involved in archiving and preserving language data. Broader impacts also include increased participation by Native Americans in fields where they are underrepresented: linguistics, computer science, and other STEM fields of study at the university. This project also received funds from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These historical Jicarilla Apache narratives contain a wealth of information about the material culture, history, and traditional practices within the Jicarilla community. This project will produce a new body of literature, increasing indigenous language literacy opportunities for community members and others. The project will use the early texts as a basis for this body of Jicarilla literature, but enhance these retranslations with new information on culture and history. The aim is to focus on the broader meanings and socio-cultural import of Jicarilla discourse; this represents a top-down approach to language revitalization, looking at discourse first, rather than a bottom-up approach, from grammatical pieces to sentence structure. The goal of this project is to use community-driven perspectives to lead to a re-analysis and reinterpretation of the narrative record. The project is designed to maximize collaboration within the community by inviting Tribal leaders and community members to participate in the work sessions and comment on the process and the products. This project will also be of great benefit to the community of academic scholars who work on Dene (Athabaskan) languages, as it will provide transcriptions and recordings relevant to the analysis of phonology, lexicon, and grammar of this particular Apachean language. Additionally, for other communities with endangered heritage languages, it can provide a model for the reclamation of archival material and for the development of new and effective pedagogical materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

A related issue is that what linguists do know comes primarily from Indo-European languages like English or Latin, which restricts the possible data set in two ways: by the linguistic structures these languages lack and by the smaller set of social situations where language shift has occurred. In order to augment the typology of shift situations and linguistic structure, this project will investigate language change through a unique set of field notes and recordings of two endangered languages of northeastern Uganda collected from 1967-1971, and from new fieldwork with the remaining speakers. Because the target languages in this study diverge typologically from much of the existing sample of structural changes as languages cease to be spoken, they offer a control against the possible hypothesis that observed structural similarities across shifting languages are attributable to historically contingent interference rather than a universal markedness hierarchy of particular grammatical structures. Broader impacts of the project include advancing the training of a post-doctoral scholar and creating learning opportunities for undergraduate linguistics students to participate in and contribute to cutting-edge research. The project will ensure the Nyangi and Soo communities also get copies of the materials in this collection, as well as providing access to the broader community of scientific researchers. Finally, the project will promote international collaboration between scholars at American and Ugandan institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of situations in which an ancestral language is replaced by a non-European language are poorly understood. In part, analyses of language shift in languages shifting to non-European languages have been hard to come by because such languages often lack documentation from before the time that they started to shift. This means that there is no reference point to compare current linguistic forms to: linguists have ending points for the types of change undergone by languages, but not starting points. This project addresses this problem by making data accessible from Nyangi (nyp) and Soo (teu), two languages that are now being replaced by African languages. The data to be digitized and archived in this project includes approximately 26 hours of audio recordings on cassette tapes and reel-to-reel tapes and approximately 3,000 pages of hand-written field notes. The resulting collection of digitized recordings will be translated into English and into the language of broader communication used by the Nyangi and Soo. A selection of its contents will be analyzed and richly annotated in consultation with the Soo and Nyangi communities. Analyses of the typological and areal motivations for the changes observed in Soo and Nyang'i in the 50 years since the recordings in this collection were made will be permanently archived in a secure and accessible location, shared and discussed at scholarly conferences, and published in linguistics journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Shoshoni [ISO 639-3 shh] is the northernmost member of the Uto-Aztecan language family, languages spoken from Wyoming to Central America. The Shoshoni language today continues to be an important component of Goshute and Shoshone tribal identity. In the 1960's-1970's, the late Wick R. Miller, of the University of Utah, taperecorded speakers of Shoshoni (born from ~1875-1920) from several different varieties, representing the most extensive documentary corpus of any Great Basin language, of vital cultural, historical, and linguistic importance to several tribal communities in the Western states. Past linguistic studies of Shoshoni have largely focused on the internal structure of sentences in isolation and on the structure of words, while this project will focus on its sound system and discourse-level structure. Broader impacts include the availability of the two corpora as free online resources from the Marriott Library (University of Utah) and the California Language Archive (UC-Berkeley).  The project will also provide undergraduates from Shoshoni-speaking tribal communities with valuable experience on a computational linguistic research project, and enhance interactions between these young people and the two native-speaker elders collaborating on the project. The team will also produce a print version and an easy-to-read electronic version of a subset of the traditional stories from the Wick R. Miller Collection and disseminate them to the three communities collaborating on the project, the South Fork Band Council of the Te-Moak Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation and the Ely Shoshone Tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Shoshoni is fairly well-documented for a Native American language, its discourse structure and its phonetics and phonology are relatively understudied. Thus, these significant gaps will be remedied by the development of two corpora.  First, the 36 stories will be marked up to produce a electronically-searchable database valuable for sentence-level as well as discourse-level linguistic studies. Second, a phonological and phonetically valuable corpus, consisting of audio-TextGrid pairs of word and sentence-sized recordings which will be force aligned and fine-tuned. In the resulting corpus, the phonemes representing each vowel and consonant will be aligned with the corresponding part of the sound file, allowing researchers to automate the acoustic phonetic analysis of each sound.  Such text-to-audio aligned corpora already exist for majority languages such as English, German, Japanese, and Spanish, making their sound systems relatively easy to study and thus leading to the development of electronic products that can quickly process spoken language.  These majority language corpora are prepared using costly, language-specific computational tools called forced aligners.  Our project will train the Montreal Forced Aligner to align the text of 4,000-5,000 Shoshoni words and short sentences to sound. Doing so will provide a model of how to inexpensively use a generic forced aligner to align text-to-audio data for any small, understudied language.  The resulting forced-aligned Shoshoni corpus will greatly speed up the acoustic analysis of this phonologically complex language and lead to many relatively inexpensive, but in-depth, scientifically-sound research studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project uses new methodologies in linguistics in order to document a Native American language, Arapaho (ISO 639-3 ARP). The project uses aerial drone video and 3D 360 video panoramas to document landscapes that are culturally significant to the Northern Arapaho people.  The project also documents stories associated with those culturally significant landscapes. This methodology will thus ""virtually"" bring elder speakers of the language into places and contexts that may be physically impossible to go to in person.  Given the importance of land and environment in indigenous communities, if successful, these technologies could be portable for documenting linguistic, cultural and other scientific knowledge of inaccessible regions.  The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. The Northern Arapaho language is a critically endangered Native American language now fluently spoken by fewer than 100 elders on the Wind River Indian Reservation in the state of Wyoming.

The project's findings will be useful for linguists interested in exploring new methodologies for language documentation and elicitation.  Once tested and formalized into a working research methodology, the applications created by this project can be utilized to other Indigenous peoples to aid in revitalizing their languages and cultures and infusing STEM curricula with culturally relevant content.

One type of multilingualism that is increasingly prevalent under pressures from globalization occurs in small, tight-knit communities wherein one of the languages being spoken is endangered. The importance of scientific investigations of these situations is twofold. First, little is known about the processes at play when multilingual people shift away from one of the languages. Second, the endangered language, which encapsulates important knowledge, often has been the least documented and researched. One important example of this situation is found in the Nasal speech community in southwest Sumatra, a region full of linguistic diversity and exceptionally complex multilingual situations. What is striking about this multilingual community is that the endangered language, Nasal, was not known by linguists until 2007, and to date it has not been the subject of any significant research. Yet, preliminary fieldwork reveals Nasal has unique linguistic properties, such as unique verbal affixes that present disparate meanings related to the ""completeness"" of an action. This project is an international collaboration between the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UHM), Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, and Nasal community. It will provide important training in linguistics to faculty and community members in Indonesia, and students in the US and Indonesia. It will also foster binational relationships between the US and Indonesia. The broader impacts also include the professional development of a UHM doctoral student and a public repository of recordings of speech events and their transcriptions that can be accessed by scholars from the US and Indonesia and Nasal community members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will document the linguistic practices of the Nasal speech community, which represents an especially complex sociolinguistic situation in Bengkulu province, Indonesia. This community is multilingual where Nasal (nsy), an endangered Malayo-Polynesian isolate with little existing documentation, is used alongside South Barisan Malay (SBM; pse) and Kaur (vkk) in everyday interactions. The primary aim of this project is to document Nasal in all of its multilingual complexity. Thus, this project will produce extensive audiovisual documentation of Nasal in its multilingual context accompanied by a comprehensive grammatical description. These materials provide crucial data into the study of multilingualism in tight-knit communities, the history of western Indonesia, and the nature of unique verbal affixes in Nasal. Furthermore, as historical linguists and archeologists piece together the history of western Indonesia, additional data from Nasal has the potential to radically alter this picture. Specific activities include: (i) assemble a large audiovisual corpus of the linguistic practices of the Nasal speech community, (ii) compile a multilingual lexicon, (iii) mentor a doctoral student who will write a dissertation on Nasal, and (iv) draft a Nasal reference grammar and Kaur sketch grammar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

For decades the field has largely focused on languages with millions (or even billions) of speakers, such as Spanish, French, Japanese, and English. We know very little about how children learn to speak most of the other 7000 languages around the world. Approximately half of these languages are in danger of disappearing, which includes all of the Algonquian language family, one of the largest groups of indigenous languages in North America. Algonquian languages such as Northern East Cree (NEC) are radically different from those typically studied in language acquisition research, and as these languages cease to be spoken, we lose the chance to understand how children acquire the fundamentally human capacity of linguistic expression. This dissertation project explores how children learn to speak NEC, one of the few remaining indigenous languages in North America still learned by children as a first language. This project analyzes and improves video/audio recordings collected by the Chisasibi Child Language Acquisition Study (CCLAS), and this dissertation also includes new fieldwork with adult speakers of NEC to provide more insight into how the language works and the stages children go through when learning the language. This dissertation project offers a range of benefits for science and for communities. It will enhance existing documentation of NEC and include child speech as well as speech from adults to children, both of which are underrepresented genres in language documentation. It will also expand the purview and deepen the diversity of language acquisition research. Furthermore, this dissertation can help provide Cree communities with better tools for language assessment and speech-language pathology, so that children may have better support on their journey to become speakers of their language. Lastly, the documentation and description generated by this dissertation can help inform the development of curricula and teaching materials for learners of the Cree language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation will enhance and expand the documentary record of NEC. This project will create new language documentation as well as enrich existing recordings of child and child-directed speech collected by the Chisasibi Child Language Acquisition Study (CCLAS). The focus of this dissertation is the first language acquisition of the expression of possession, which is a fundamental concept in cognitive and linguistic development. This project will create and advance language documentation on two fronts. First, research involves working with adult speakers of NEC to review CCLAS recordings and elicit and transcribe adult-like targets. This will produce hours of transcribed and annotated audio recordings of NEC as well as unique metalinguistic commentary and analysis. Second, these adult targets, transcriptions, elicitations, analysis, commentary, and notes will be used to enrich the existing CCLAS corpus. This work will help enable CCLAS to make additional transcripts, annotations, and media files publicly available. Through this work, this dissertation will help break new scientific ground. For example, this dissertation examines speech genres often absent in language documentation, and it enriches the range and typological diversity of language acquisition research. This project can also provide insight to help ensure that methods and tools in language assessment and speech-language pathology are linguistically and culturally inappropriate. The findings from this research can also inform the creation of curriculum and pedagogical materials to benefit not only second language learners but also meet the needs of schools teaching Cree-speaking children about the structure of their mother tongue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The laboratory is able to support a wide variety of projects and numerous students, graduate interns, researchers, and visiting scholars every year, and contributes to knowledge diffusion through close scientific collaborations between MURR staff and outside researchers, student education, and professional publications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MURR Archaeometry Laboratory focuses on elemental and isotopic analysis in order to examine the production, exchange, and movement of a broad variety of artifacts including ceramics, lithics, and metals, using neutron activation analysis (NAA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) including a laser ablation system and a multi-collector. The laboratory also supports geochemical research on the petrogenesis of various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Broader impacts of the Archaeometry Laboratory at MURR include: (1) availability of affordable chemical and isotopic analyses for students and faculty from academic departments and non-profit research organizations in the US; (2) training of undergraduate and graduate students in the selection and use of laboratory methods of analysis; (3) advice in project design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of the chemical and isotopic data; and (4) public access by archaeologists, geologists, and scientists from many disciplines to the compositional database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

An oxygen glow discharge converts organic material in rock paintings samples to carbon dioxide, which can be radiocarbon dated using accelerator mass spectrometry. Plasma oxidation has been used to radiocarbon date organic binders in mineral-pigmented paintings, as well as many charcoal-pigmented paintings. In recent years, there has been an increased demand by rock art researchers to use the plasma extraction technique for dating studies. The ability to place rock art in a chronological context allows an inventory of images to be studied together with excavated cultural remains from a given archaeological time period. This incorporation of rock art studies alongside other archaeological specialties, such as lithics, ceramics, and weaving techniques, is crucial for developing a synergistic approach to studying past cultures. Before dating methods were developed, only relative ages and approximate age ranges for some distinct genres of rock art were possible. Without a way to place the images in time, archaeologists had mostly ignored these insights into past human cultures. The integration of chemistry and archaeology through this project will directly address a national need for interdisciplinary research. NSF support for the plasma oxidation laboratory fosters collaborations among archaeologists worldwide. In addition, we will train university students interested in archaeological science as interns. More scientists with interests in applying chemical knowledge to archaeological and cultural applications are needed. Public outreach for archaeological science will be accomplished via Shumla's blog, popular magazines/websites, the Shumla Scholars STEM program, and public outreach events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Steelman has designed a 10 chamber system that has the ability to oxidize 10 paint samples in tandem for batch processing. This will increase sample throughput, decrease analysis time, and reduce costs for rock art dating. By constructing a multi-sample plasma oxidation laboratory, batch processing of paint samples will allow Shumla to expand research for additional archaeological projects. USGS coal (C14-free) and ANU sucrose (modern) radiocarbon standards will be used to test the accuracy and precision of results. At sites where calcium oxalate coatings are present, both oxalate dates from accretions and plasma oxidation dates from paintings agree, suggesting valid results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

While modern anthropological and sociological research is increasingly oriented toward the transnational nature of cultures and languages, other disciplines, like linguistics, may lag in comparison. Moreover, because many displaced people are speakers of minority languages, the pressure to shift to more politically and culturally advantageous languages threatens the transmission of minority languages to future generations. As a result, linguists are increasingly finding themselves conducting time sensitive work with speakers of understudied languages in diaspora communities. This award will convene a symposium to address this gap in linguistics, bringing the field into a fuller dialogue with other social sciences, as well as emerging research on transnational networks and their relevance to the economic, medical, and legal problems of the modern world. The broader impacts of the symposium include enabling community language experts who are personally affected by the threat of linguistic and cultural attrition in diaspora environments to connect with others in similar situations in order to develop mutually beneficial solutions, as well as to prepare a set best practices for linguistic research in diaspora contexts that incorporates perspectives from migration studies and can be disseminated to enhance the training of those involved in linguistic research with diaspora communities.<br/> <br/>The symposium will bring together linguists working with threatened languages spoken in diasporic contexts in both urban and rural communities around the United States of America to interact with specialists in different areas of migration studies, including political conflict, refugee studies, and urbanization. Best practices in the social sciences must adapt to the changing social and political circumstances in our world, in particular the worldwide flows of immigrants and refugees.  Yet many of the widely accepted best practices in linguistic research fail to take the sociopolitical situation of speakers into account and start from assumptions about language communities that are inapplicable to languages spoken in diasporic contexts. Working in diasporic contexts also raises questions beyond the scope of traditional training. These questions pertain to how a language community is defined; how to work with communities in conflict; and how language change takes place in hyperdiverse contexts. Symposium participants will write a consensus-based white paper proposing best practices for linguistic research in diaspora contexts and promulgate this text for wider scholarly discussion among linguists and other researchers with overlapping specializations. Such a collaborative effort has the potential to increase the efficacy of future work on languages spoken in diaspora communities. Project activities will be valuable to scholars already working in diaspora contexts and will offer foundational training to both undergraduate and graduate students in anthropological, descriptive, documentary, and theoretical linguistics programs. Activities also have the potential to enhance multidisciplinary research beyond linguistics with the involvement of other social scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The recognizable fauna of the African savanna as we know it - dominated by elephants, zebras, and many kinds of antelopes - was also established during this critical interval of environmental change, characterized by expanding C4 vegetation (predominantly grasses). Despite the importance of the Late Miocene in human and mammalian evolution, the fossil record from the Late Miocene in eastern Africa is restricted to only a handful of sites in the East African Rift System (EARS). This high-risk research project will improve our understanding of human and mammalian evolution in the Late Miocene by developing the scientific potential of a newly discovered fossil site called Tumbili Estate, located outside the EARS in the highlands of Laikipia County, Kenya. This project will provide research experience for American and Kenyan undergraduate and graduate students, which will bolster the researcher pipeline and lead to a more globally engaged workforce. Through our partnership with the Laikipia Forum, a consortium of local Kenyan stakeholders, this project will enhance the understanding of human evolution among community members, and give local people a voice in the science being conducted on their land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA evidence has firmly established that the human, gorilla and chimpanzee lineages originated during the Late Miocene. However, the fossil evidence for the origin of these lineages is meager. The known ape fossils from the Late Miocene are fragmentary, and the potential links between the fossils and the modern apes are largely unknown. The recovery of additional fossil ape and/or hominin (i.e., human ancestor) fossils from this time period is the key to understanding the origin of the hominin, gorilla, and chimpanzee lineages. This research project will confirm the age and extent of sediments at the Tumbili Estate, which likely date between 9 - 10 Ma based on fossils previously recovered, and also allow survey of nearby areas for additional sites. Analysis of the paleoenvironment at Tumbili will provide valuable new data bearing on the timing of the C4 vegetation expansion and the modernization of the African mammalian fauna. The fact that Tumbili is located on a high-elevation plateau far outside the EARS will add significantly to our understanding of the spatial and altitudinal variation of the habitats on the landscape during the Late Miocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These data will be compared with human and chimpanzee genomic data to identify potential shared evolutionary mechanisms in the evolution of birdsong and human language. By illuminating the molecular mechanisms of auditory perception that support learning of a more flexible vocal behavior in the model system, the research may shed light on our understanding of normal functionality and disorders of human speech.

Specific aims of the project include: (i) an investigation of the evolutionary forces underlying the changes in vocal behavior in BF relative to WBM utilizing whole-genome sequencing of individuals within the two bird strains and subsequent scans for signatures of positive or relaxed selection, thus allowing identification of candidate genes modified in this transition; (ii) an analysis of genetically regulated differences in neurological function correlated with differences in the flexibility of adult vocal production between BF and WBM, by comparing measures of gene expression for whole transcriptomes from main birdsong-related brain areas of BF and WBM adult males exposed to unfamiliar conspecific song; and (iii) a comparison of the birdsong data to neuroanatomical and genomic data provided by studies of human divergence from closely related primates (e.g. chimpanzee) to identify possible evolutionary parallelisms.",2019

Scholars have increasingly come to view Classic Maya rulers as being reliant on ceremony to bring followers together, due to a lack of overt political power. In contexts where the ruling classes lack the tangible power to affect the everyday lives of their subjects, intermediate elites (those between the highest rulers and the commoner masses) often fulfill important roles as mediators between the ruling family and their followers. By identifying how the relative wealth and status and ceremonial and economic bases of power of three autonomous local elite families changed as they became co-opted by the emergent Lower Dover polity, Walden will show how incorporation impacted the agency of intermediate elites. Did the local elites lose wealth and status, and their bases of power upon incorporation into a polity? If so, this would suggest Maya rulers wielded high degrees of political, economic and ceremonial power. Conversely, if little change is apparent or the co-opted intermediate elites witness an increase in their power, then this would corroborate current perspectives envisaging ruling elites as lacking explicit political power. The approach is grounded in an anthropological perspective on the co-option of local political leaders by external powers, and consequentially offers a comparative window into contemporary foreign policy and incorporation in the developing world. The results of the study will be made accessible in Walden's dissertation, and a series of academic publications. All data will be freely available through the University of Pittsburgh Center for Comparative Archaeology. The project will form the basis for training local and international students in archaeological practice and serve to educate local Belizeans about their past through a series of outreach events, lectures and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walden will examine changes at three intermediate elite centers situated around the political capital of Lower Dover; Tutu Uitz Na, Floral Park and Barton Ramie, and include data from the commoner neighborhoods which surrounded each intermediate elite center. Understanding the wealth and quality of life of client commoners will show whether local elites favored more exploitative or communally beneficial strategies in their dealings with their subordinates, and how this changed when the rulers of Lower Dover established themselves. Comparison of possible variability between the three intermediate elite families will allow an understanding of the different factors which structured how much political power intermediate elites retained following the rise of Lower Dover. For instance, did local elites located geographically closer to Lower Dover see a more dramatic reduction in their power, or did more politically powerful local elites possess greater opportunities for negotiating their role in the new polity? Analysis of residential and ceremonial architecture and the changing proportions of utilitarian, high value and ritual items within these structures will show how inequality, patterns of production, consumption and ritual activity changed as the polity rose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Catherine Klesner, a graduate student at the University of Arizona under the direction of Dr. Pamela Vandiver, will characterize the provenience of finely decorated glazed pottery from Central Asia to determine the scale of local production and technological innovations and to understand the stylistic models for local development provided by long distance trade during the Medieval Period. The ceramics in study were excavated from archaeological sites which lie on the northern edge of the Tien Shen Mountains. This narrow corridor occupies an important geographical position on the Silk Road and for millennia facilitated the complex trade and knowledge networks that transverse Eurasia. By examining the ceramics, the researchers will better understand both the physical trade networks in place during the 9th-15th centuries, but also how technologies were transmitted, and local traditions adapted with the influx of nonlocal goods. The research will shed light on how complex trade networks are developed and the role they play in the development of social complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will examine the composition and isotope signatures of the lead-glazed pottery from sites in southern Kazakhstan as well as the microstructure of the ceramic bodies and glazes in an effort to reconstruct their production technology.

Carballo, Mary Clarke of Boston University will undertake research to study the socioeconomic relationships that comprised ancient Maya economies, focusing specifically on labor relations and artisanal production. Previous scholarship on ancient economies has focused on a number of variables, including the organization of production, the level of commercialization, and the organization of marketplaces and marketplace exchange. While some contexts suggest that the work of producers was directly supported by consumers (they may have provided materials, subsistence goods, and, in some cases, housing for producers), others illustrate that producers worked independently and could directly profit from the commercial exchange or sale of the goods they produced. Commercial activities, however, can still be managed by representatives of the state: the price of goods can be fixed, entrepreneurial activities can be encouraged or prohibited, and financial institutions may control the means of and opportunities for exchange. The evaluation of commercialization in ancient societies requires knowledge of political organization and its strategies, which are reflected in the material records of marketplace exchange, such as marketplaces, household assemblages, and workshops. Archaeology is particularly well placed to provide relevant insight because it can evaluate the material evidence within these locations, which can then be compared across a community, a site, a region as a means of reconstructing ancient economies and economic transactions. Because this research will be conducted by MS Clarke as part of her doctoral dissertation research it will serve a valuable educational function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Clarke will evaluate the ancient Maya economy through an investigation of limestone workshops and producer households. Limestone is a ubiquitous material in Mesoamerica that was used by the ancient Maya for a myriad of purposes, including the construction of monumental art and architecture. Stelae, altars, lintels, and temple stairways made of cut and carved limestone were inscribed with narratives documenting real and mythological events, as well as with depictions of key ritual performances and supernatural beings. At the site of Xultun, Guatemala, a stone production district was found where domestic architecture is integrated with quarry workshops wherein incomplete monuments were found still attached to the limestone bedrock. The limestone producers in this district were specifically producing materials for monumental state expressions, implying a single consumer, the state. Using this district as a case study, this project will assess multiple working hypotheses to address one broader question: how was limestone production organized, both socially and economically, at Xultun, and what does this tell us about labor and power in early societies? Through the analysis of chipped, ground, and pecked stone from Xultun, this project will establish the distribution and nucleation of limestone production work across the site. Moving from social to economic organization, this project will evaluate the systems of exchange visible in household consumption patterns to determine the commercialization of limestone and the extent of state involvement in its production and distribution. Results will be contextualized within the broader, multi-scalar frames of non-renewable resource management, commercialization and local exchange systems, and the production and projection of state identity in ancient society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Systems of food production and distribution are closely tied to the economic organization and social structure of a society, and can serve to reinforce social inequalities, particularly in cities in which many households do not directly produce their own food. Archaeology is ideally situated to investigate the many ways in which food systems contributed to urban developments in the world's earliest cities, providing a unique perspective that can inform on the potential impacts of today's growing urban populations. This project will provide a comparative data on one aspect of the food system from an important pre-modern city, foster international and interdisciplinary collaboration, and engage in public outreach within the research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the role of animals in the urban economy of a pre-modern city that is a vital case study in understanding the relationships between food production, urban economies and the development of social inequalities.

The research will evaluate how urban and rural residents of Teotihuacan acquired animals, and the role of hunting and raising animals to the urban economy. To evaluate multiple trajectories of change over time, this study presents an innovative integration of zooarchaeological analysis, to identify the types of animals consumed by residents, and carbon stable isotope analysis to distinguish animals from natural environments, and those which lived in anthropogenic environments, such as agricultural fields or animal pens.

This phenomenon, covering about 50,000 square miles, is popularly known as the ""Vacant Quarter."" Archaeological research elsewhere has shown that climatic factors commonly play a central role in large-scale regional depopulations, and recent evidence suggests that a series of severe multi-decadal droughts struck eastern North America in the AD 1300s and 1400s. These droughts appear to have been the result of wide swings in precipitation caused by the period of global cooling known as the Little Ice Age. Nevertheless, there is extreme variability in the ways in which societies adapt to environmental as well as social stresses. The project will involve a comparative study of a number of archaeological sites in two sub-regions, central Tennessee and northern Mississippi, in the larger abandoned region. Both areas witnessed an apparent exodus of people about AD 1450. However, prior to that time, they had very different histories of occupation culturally and ecologically.

This phenomenon, covering about 50,000 square miles, is popularly known as the ""Vacant Quarter."" Archaeological research elsewhere has shown that climatic factors commonly play a central role in large-scale regional depopulations, and recent evidence suggests that a series of severe multi-decadal droughts struck eastern North America in the AD 1300s and 1400s. These droughts appear to have been the result of wide swings in precipitation caused by the period of global cooling known as the Little Ice Age. Nevertheless, there is extreme variability in the ways in which societies adapt to environmental as well as social stresses. The project will involve a comparative study of a number of archaeological sites in two sub-regions, central Tennessee and northern Mississippi, in the larger abandoned region. Both areas witnessed an apparent exodus of people about AD 1450. However, prior to that time, they had very different histories of occupation culturally and ecologically. The research team will combine excavations with ceramic sourcing analyses, subsistence studies, and examinations of conflict to address similarities and differences in population movement, foodways, and warfare in the two study areas resulting from deterioration in their ecological and social surroundings, and how these processes ultimately led to contemporaneous mass migrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Severe natural disasters during the past decade include unprecedented flooding, devastating wildfires, and catastrophic hurricanes. On September 14, 2018, Hurricane Florence made landfall off the coast of Wilmington, North Carolina, causing billions of dollars in damage to the state and surrounding region. Robeson County was one of the hardest hit counties in North Carolina, with catastrophic flooding causing substantial damage to residences, businesses, and infrastructure. The same county had experienced widespread damage following Hurricane Matthew in 2016 as well.  Many in the hardest hit areas were still experiencing long-term impacts from Hurricane Matthew in 2018, including loss of employment and physical health problems related to exposure to mold and other contaminants. Research focused on the experiences of individuals in this county offers a unique opportunity to better understand how individuals cope with and recover from severe and ongoing stress in the post-disaster context. This project seeks to gain a richer understanding of how individuals manage post-disaster recovery and the extent to which individual and social factors predict both positive and negative outcomes. By integrating theories of post-disaster adjustment and using advanced data analytic techniques, the current study will lead to a better understanding of individual and community responses to extreme events and inform the development of future interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online surveys and daily ""check in"" assessments administered via smart phone technology will be used to study psychological adjustment, social support, community solidarity, and coping efforts among adult residents of Robeson County, North Carolina who were exposed to severe and repeated hurricane-related stress. The surveys and the daily ""check-ins"" will provide critical data on how people cope with stress over time, including the extent to which social and individual factors affect adjustment. By cultivating a very rich set of data on the same individuals over time, it will be possible to discern patterns of recovery, and understanding which we are currently lacking. Measuring outcomes on a daily basis will generate significant amounts of data and we will use advanced non-linear data analysis methods to identify unique changes or shifts in functioning predicted by guiding theoretical frameworks (self-regulation shift theory and social support deterioration deterrence theory). This project extends current knowledge related to post-disaster recovery by targeting key social and coping mechanisms of change and highlighting possible critical targets for interventions in the near and long-term post disaster context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The origins of inequality in ancient societies is a central concern in anthropological archaeology with significant implications for wider understanding of inequality in today's world.   Previous research has documented conditions under which persistent institutionalized inequalities are likely to develop.  These include the presence of defensible subsistence resources and the possibility for inter-generational transmission of wealth, access to wealth, and rights to wealth.  Debate continues regarding the historical processes that give rise to material inequality with some reseachers asserting inequality to be an inevitable outcome of inherent human striving for personal economic and reproductive success under conditions of resource abundance versus others who argue that inequality is an unintended byproduct of competitive conditions during periods of resource shortfall.  Archaeology is poised to offer significant contributions to these discussions given the ability to reconstruct social evolutionary process over lengthy time spans.  The research is designed to facilitate extensive public outreach regarding indigenous culture and history along with STEM training opportunities for college students.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Prentiss and her research team will examine the origins of material wealth-based inequality at the Bridge River village in the Middle Fraser Canyon of interior British Columbia.  The Bridge River site is an ideal place to study the evolution of inequality given the excellent record of human occupation spanning the past 2000 years.  This archaeological excavation project is designed to develop fine-grained tests of alternative hypotheses concerning variation in the integrated roles of demographic change, subsistence intensification, storage variability, social networking, and large scale cooking and food-sharing (""feasting"") events associated with the origins of inequality.   The interdisciplinary research team sets a new standard for excavation and laboratory study of prehistoric cooking features in Northwestern North America with analytical approaches including sediment micromorphology, ancient DNA analysis, plant tissue identification from carbonized remains, sediment geochemistry, and advanced approaches to stone artifact and animal bone studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project builds on previous research collaborations by both principal investigators that have established immigration patterns and cultural interactions in ancient civilizations for Egyptian and Nubian sites within the Nile River Valley based primarily on strontium isotope signatures of archaeological faunal (soil, animal, plant) and human samples. The results from this first time, detailed investigation will accurately trace any temporal change in the regional distribution of bioavailable strontium driven by a drying climate within the Nile River Valley. This approach will prove extremely useful for other regions around the globe where recent climatic conditions have changed significantly during the archaeological period of interest. Strontium isotopes in soil and living and fossil materials vary on a regional basis and using isotope ratios scientists can trace how individual during their lifetimes moved between regions.

Samples will also be obtained from collections of pertinent museums worldwide. Assessing the bioavailable strontium for the Nile River Valley will also rely on synthesizing existing strontium isotope data obtained by both PIs from ~250 specimens, which consist of both archaeological human and faunal samples investigated from Egyptian (Memphis, Qurneh) and Nubian (Shellal, C-Group, Pharaonic, Amara West, Tombos, Kerma) sites. These combined results will help to characterize the isotope variability and better understand human mobility in this region, which is rich with sociopolitical transitions and contact between groups. The results obtained from this project will help elucidate any input or influence of Holocene climate change within the Nile River Valley for the past ~4,000 years. By comparing archaeological or paleo-strontium isotope signatures of faunal samples to their present-day counterparts, our study will provide a better understanding of aeolian (wind-driven) contribution, if any, within the Nile River Valley. The proposed research will have major implications for archaeologists conducting isotope-based investigations of ancient migrations around the globe since climate change is a phenomenon that has occurred throughout Earth's history.

In recent decades, however, archaeological research across the African Diaspora has begun to explore the nature of resistance movements in colonial slave societies and the new societies forged in their ashes. The quest for freedom is taking center stage in archaeologies of enslavement, revealing how Africans and their descendants participated actively in the making of the modern world. And yet, one critically relevant exemplar of resistance has been absent from archaeological analysis, the independent states of post-revolution Haiti. Led by Prof. J. Cameron Monroe (UC Santa Cruz) and collaborators from Haiti and the US, this project explores how material culture was used to express political independence and identity in northern Haiti after the Haitian Revolution. The project examines how elites in post-revolutionary Haiti used public and private architecture, domestic objects, and everyday meals to manifest independence from France, as well as political control over a rural populace. The project will contribute to a broader understanding of the diversity of state-making processes in the Age of Revolutions, and the complex ways that material culture shaped national identity in the past and continues to do so in the present. The project contributes to long-term development plans for Haiti's National Historic Park, identified as one of 5 primary targets for cultural heritage development following the earthquake of 2010. Additionally, the project is providing field training experience for graduate students and college students from Haiti and the United States, particularly students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Milot Archaeological Project (MAP) engages theories of sovereignty that highlight the use of material culture to make, and reject, claims to political power in the past. The project focuses on the Royal Palace of Sans-Souci, located in the historic town of Milot in Haiti's Northern Department. Sans-Souci, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982, was the primary royal residence of King Henry Christophe, first and last king of the short lived Kingdom of Haiti (1811-1820). Sans-Souci was built as an exceptional example of the Neoclassical architectural style, a tradition used around the Atlantic World to represent symbolically the imposition of order, rationality, individuality, and freedom - Enlightenment-era values that guided state craft in the Age of Revolutions. Archaeological research at Sans-Souci examines the relationship between the public expression of these values, represented in architecturally, and their reception, rejection, and reformulation within domestic contexts. Project participants bring together non-invasive archaeological survey, 3D modelling, and the analysis of artifact, faunal, and botanical remains from excavated domestic contexts to address these issues. This project provides an important Caribbean example to longstanding discussions about the relationship between Enlightenment-era ideologies and consumer practices taking root across the Atlantic world. Additionally, project is the first to explore the nature of state formation in post-colonial Caribbean, providing an historical rich and archaeologically robust case study with which to model state formation processes more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This research began with a chance finding in 2012 during archaeological excavations in a floodplain in the Chincha valley of southern Peru.

This was quite unexpected because archaeologists and paleo-climate specialists had assumed the area to have been open desert prior to human occupation.  Previous scientific consensus was that the desert was irrigated around 3000 years ago by people using canals drawn from the deeply entrenched rivers that course through the valley.  Additional work found similar patterns of hydromorphic (waterlogged) soils and evidence of the use of artificial drainage canals.

With Dr. Arthur?s leadership, her team plans for small scale testing of the forests to retrieve soil samples and artifacts, to date and reconstruct the environmental and cultural history of the forests. The team also intends to conduct an environmental assessment and map the living forests, as well as core sample the highland springs to obtain historic pollen for environmental reconstruction.  The team anticipates the construction of a model outlining the relationship between the past and present cultural and environmental factors examining how people living on the borderlands of states are able to resist or be resilient to conflict through forest conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The goal of the workshop is to identify ways to facilitate research and education in this markedly interdisciplinary field that is assuming increased prominence in the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Bioarchaeology exists at the intersection of biological anthropology, archaeology, and socio-cultural anthropology. Practitioners to date have largely been trained in one of these sub-fields, assimilating additional information on an ad hoc basis.  The proposed workshop will focus upon creating a model curriculum across the relevant fields, while also defining big picture questions that invite bioarchaeological input. Problematic areas of methodological topics, especially those relating to research design and analytical methods, will receive in-depth treatment. The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective methodologies and avenues for the dissemination of findings from anthropological research to promote public scientific understanding. Products from the workshop will be made publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion at the workshop will focus on key issues facing the field, both curricular and in research. Examples include: 1) identifying and implementing a desirable balance in training between evolutionary theory, social theory, and methods; 2) how to creatively and effectively deal with the osteological paradox; 3) the research balance between big picture questions and focused, contextually rich research; 4) statistical approaches to small sample sizes and integrating continuous and categorical data; and 5) the importance of outreach and sensitivity to perspectives of descendent communities. Bioarchaeology, profoundly interdisciplinary, has emerged as a productive and popular anthropological research and teaching domain. To date, there has been no encompassing consideration of the curricular and research issues that should be addressed in order to advance the field and to take advantage of 21st century developments from outside anthropology, for example, in biogeochemistry, epigenetics, statistics, public health, and other physical and social sciences.

Most such narratives about how past human societies have dealt with environmental change conflate political stability with social stability, assuming that if a political entity survives it means that the society has successfully adapted. But the interests of polities and of the individual communities they administer do not always align, and maintaining political stability in a rapidly changing world comes at the cost of at least some political subjects who must bear the costs of ""adaptation."" Luke Auld-Thomas, a Ph.D. candidate at Tulane University, will conduct archaeological research under the supervision of Dr. Marcello A. Canuto to investigate the reorganization of communities in the hinterlands of El Achiotal, an ancient Maya polity that survived a period of severe environmental change with its political institutions intact. This project advances understanding of the processes that occur within polities beset by environmental change, asking whether political stability in the context of environmental duress is underwritten by the reorganization of other aspects of social life. Such considerations are fundamental as the contemporary world absorbs the effects of environmental change and policymakers grapple with how to distribute the costs of maintaining social and/or political stability, and this research will shed light on the internal social transformations that allow polities to endure. Moreover, the research location in northwestern Guatemala is an area under extreme environmental and political pressure tied to narcotics trafficking, illegal ranging, and deforestation, and the project plays a stabilizing role by helping to strengthen local stakeholder institutions with an interest in maintaining the forest and building legal and sustainable livelihoods, specifically archaeological tourism. The project will train Guatemalan undergraduate students in the use of remote sensing technology in archaeology, increasing local capacity for documenting and preserving cultural heritage resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Auld-Thomas will utilize airborne laser scanning (lidar) to rapidly document the distribution of archaeological features underneath forest canopy, which allows researchers to move directly to targeted excavations instead of spending years locating archaeological remains through traditional ground survey. The project develops a rigorous methodology for rapid, lidar-assisted settlement survey and excavation that is easily adaptable to other forested regions, ultimately allowing archaeological research in these areas to proceed more efficiently in terms of both time and funding. Through test excavations of a large sample of both residential and public buildings (totaling about 50 sampled buildings) distributed across four intensively-surveyed ~1km2 settlement zones around El Achiotal, this project will document changes in where people lived and in the types of settlements they inhabited through time, allowing for a reconstruction of broad-scale social changes in the hinterlands of the El Achiotal polity as it coped with a changing landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These decisions become even more complicated when they involve groups with substantial power differences. The archaeological record, with its numerous example cases and substantial time depth, holds valuable insights regarding these issues. This doctoral dissertation project, directed by Kaitlyn Davis and Dr. Scott Ortman of the University of Colorado-Boulder, will assess the interplay between Spanish impositions and Native agency with regard to Pueblo economic and agricultural practices in 16th and 17th century New Mexico. The goal is to better understand the Pueblo agricultural economy prior to and following Spanish contact. The data collected for this project will address gaps in the understanding of the implications of and responses to colonialism in the Americas, reassessing and complicating the colonial narrative in light of Native agency. The data will also help fill in gaps in the understanding of how indigenous arid-land agricultural systems operated, and continue to operate, in the Americas. The multi-crop agricultural potential model produced by this project will be instructive as to where good agricultural areas are in the study area today, and thus has environmental sustainability value and will be of use to scholars as well as farmers. Finally, working with local landowners and Pueblo community members through every step of this project will provide educational opportunities and a positive example of collaborative archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spanish colonization of the Northern Rio Grande region in New Mexico contributed to demographic changes, additional demands on the finite land base, and changes in the economic system, including changes in trade networks and taxation. The recent literature on this period has tended to interpret changes in the archaeological record as deriving from the impositions of or resistance to Spanish colonization. While both did occur, what has been overlooked is the extent to which Pueblo people also took advantage of the opportunities presented by introduced Spanish crops, technologies, and livestock, adapting them for Pueblo use and incorporating them into Pueblo life. In previous scholarship, considerations of local agricultural production have been largely divorced from the economic system they fit into. In this project, the researchers will assess the role of Spanish introductions in Pueblo economics and settlement by: 1) creating spatial models of agricultural potential for indigenous and introduced crops and combining these with artifact and settlement data; 2) determining associations between field types and crop types by collecting and analyzing microbotanical samples from various field types at two pre-Hispanic Pueblos and two colonial-era Pueblos; and 3) assessing changing investment in various field types, technologies, and associated crops through surface survey of field features and dateable artifacts at these four sites. These efforts will yield a better picture of agricultural potential versus agricultural investment through time to reveal Native choices in a changing economic and social system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Radiocarbon dating is one of the most important developments in archaeology from the 20th century, making it possible to directly date materials from the past. However, many artifacts are too small or fragile to survive the standard methods for preparing samples for radiocarbon dating. Dr. Ruth Ann Armitage, of Eastern Michigan University, and her team of collaborating archaeologists and students will evaluate the use of plasma chemical oxidation (PCO) for preparing samples of small, fragmentary or fragile artifacts for radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The focus of the project is dating endangered rock art, burned bone, and fragments shed from fragile textiles that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to radiocarbon date directly. PCO has been used for decades as a way to extract organic carbon from inorganic carbon matrices to date rock paintings. It is also a way to date fragile organic materials without destroying them, allowing for repeated dating of the same sample. However, much remains to be learned about the capabilities and limitations of the PCO technique. Validation of the PCO method is critical to applying it in a meaningful way to answer questions about the age of artifacts that might otherwise be overlooked. The Armitage group has a long track record of collaborative work between chemists and archaeologists to better understand past human society and behavior through radiocarbon dating and chemical analysis of artifacts. This project will develop a method for handling, processing and radiocarbon dating archaeological samples that could not be dated otherwise, adding to what is known about people and their activities in the past. The award supports a diverse group of scientists and students at a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) doing novel, anthropologically-relevant archaeology research in collaboration with archaeologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Armitage and her team seek to demonstrate the accuracy, precision and minimum sample size that can be AMS dated with PCO sample preparation through comparative studies of rock painting samples, calcined bones, and textile fragments. Their work will aid in understanding the effects of chemical pretreatments on samples dated in this way, as well as improving the method so that it can become more widely applicable. The proposed project will investigate the fundamental limitations of the PCO method in order to optimize its use for otherwise difficult to date archaeological materials. The project examines minimally-destructive and rapid methods for reliably dating these types of samples with AMS radiocarbon analysis. Successful completion of the proposal's objectives will improve the ability to date archeological materials. The team seeks to validate PCO as a sample preparation method for AMS radiocarbon analysis through comparative measurements and chemical analysis. The project results will be disseminated through a conference symposium, workshop, and book to disseminate the results of the project to a diverse audience of anthropological archaeologists and physical scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These large houses, and the complex multifamily households that resided in them, have been the economic engines of the society and the scale at which resources were managed and maintained over the last five millennia. Investigations of plankhouses will therefore provide foundational data for understanding how small-scale societies can effectively organize economics, people and resources in ways that promote sustainability and resilience at the local level. The study of Northwest Coast lifeways, with its emphasis on local management of resources and decentralized decision making, can reveal potentially new strategies and options for reshaping current social practices towards greater sustainability. Archaeology is particularly suited to address these goals because it considers a range of societies with multiple different organizational principles. The project will provide cutting-edge training for graduate and undergraduate students in these increasingly important geophysical techniques. Moreover, in the face of rising sea levels, the methodological advances that will result offer a mechanism to expediently collect critical archaeological data from the globally-threatened coastal archaeological record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Grier and his team will employ geophysical prospection methods, a set of techniques used to visualize the subsurface of archaeological sites without excavation. Traditional archaeological excavation is both costly and time consuming, which has resulted in a very limited sample of well-documented houses and villages for the region. Geophysical methods can provide a low-impact alternative, but they have been applied only in a limited way on the Northwest Coast. The researchers will develop a rigorous methodology for connecting the signals generated by geophysical techniques, such as ground penetrating radar and magnetometry, to specific buried archaeological features. They will generate a predictive model and evaluate predictions using limited ""ground-trothing"" excavation. Archaeological sites are a non-renewable resource, and geophysical methods, if systematically applied, can provide a means to acquire substantial data with minimal impacts, an approach consistent with the interests of First Nations/Native American Tribes, and useful for Cultural Resource Management practitioners and Public/Federal land managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The Basin of Mexico settlement pattern survey led by Drs. Jeffrey Parsons (University of Michigan) and William T. Sanders (Penn State) stands as one of the most important regional studies of modern archaeology. The survey has served as a model for regional settlement pattern projects in other parts of Mesoamerica, including Michael Smith's survey of the Yautepec Valley in Morelos. This project will organize, conserve, and make more accessible the survey collections for future scientific research. The Basin of Mexico and Yautepec surveys together recorded over 4,500 sites, including in the core of the Aztec empire. Many of the sites have since been obscured or destroyed by urban growth and agricultural activities. The maintenance of archaeological collections is crucial as they comprise the material record of excavations and surveys and are themselves part of the archaeological record of the human past. Artifact collections and records are an on-going database for scientific studies with new methods and techniques. Analysis of collections also can conserve and help manage sites for future investigations. In Central Mexico urban growth, construction, and other land use changes have destroyed or obscured many prehispanic and Early Colonial sites, making these collections irreplaceable. Dr. Deborah Nichols, Dartmouth College and colleagues from Arizona State University will provide for the long-term access and management of the survey collections as irreplaceable scientific data by 1. Developing storage space at the ASU Teotihuacan Research Laboratory to archive the collections there for future research and education; 2.

When speakers of English modify a sentence with 'apparently', they convey that their evidence comes not from direct first-hand experience, but from either a report or an inference. Other languages make evidential distinctions with specialized evidential morphemes, which encode direct perceptual evidence or indirect reportative or inferential evidence. There is great variety in how evidentiality is expressed grammatically across languages, yet the kinds of evidential meanings that are conveyed are remarkably few and consistent, suggesting the involvement of grammatical constraints. To understand the grammar of evidentiality it is fruitful to study sentences with embedding verbs that explicitly encode evidence type, like 'see', 'hear', 'gather', and others that allow a range of evidential interpretations, like 'say', 'think', 'believe'. In addition to providing a point of comparison for evidential morphemes in terms of meaning, such verbs also allow the study of whether evidence can be dissociated from the speaker and attributed to the subject of the embedding verb. The mechanisms of evidential anchoring in contexts of embedding can be compared to those of temporal anchoring. Temporal morphemes situate events in time relative to the speech context, or to the main clause event in contexts of embedding. Understanding the orientation of evidentials in embedded contexts will advance our understanding of the role of syntactic structure in encoding such aspects of linguistic meaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study the links between evidentiality and temporality in Paraguayan Guarani, an indigenous language of the Tupi-Guarani family. The language has no tense, and some of its evidential morphemes express temporal meanings, providing a special perspective on the typological tendency for temporal morphemes to encode evidential categories. The researchers will ask native speakers of Paraguayan Guarani to evaluate and produce sentences in context. A corpus study of written texts will supplement the data gathered from participants. Of particular interest will be the distribution and interpretation of evidential morphemes in clauses embedded under verbs of speech, thought and perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

But communication is not always successful.  Sometimes people are misunderstood, their intended meaning is taken the wrong way, or it is missed entirely.  Misunderstandings often have serious consequences and can lead to faulty and harmful decisions.  Past research on miscommunication has tended to focus on specific types of miscommunication, such as that between people of different genders or cultures.  The goal of this project is to develop a more general theoretical model of miscommunication.  The aim is to gain a clearer understanding of the general principles involved in communicative misunderstanding.  A special focus of this project is miscommunication that occurs in digital contexts, such as texting and email.  The research will help to uncover general principles, increase basic understanding of miscommunication, and identify the factors that contribute to it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates insights from social psychology, linguistics and communications to develop and test a model of communicative misunderstandings in the context of digital communication (texts, email, etc.). A general framework is developed in which miscommunication is defined as an instance of a sender's communicative intent not being correctly recognized by the recipient.  An important facet of the model is a focus on the interpersonal process of face management (a person's public identity).  The research considers how factors such as culture, individual differences, and emoji influence the salience of face management, and how these combine to predict message characteristics and communicative success.  Eleven experiments address critical questions about miscommunication.  The research will show how the linguistic realization of specific speech acts and emotions vary as a function of threats to public identity (face-threat), and how the relationship between different intentions can influence communication errors.  It will also consider the role of emoji in message production and intention recognition, and how these processes are moderated by cultural and individual differences in communication style and mentalizing capacities.

In addition to enhancing knowledge about how specific mechanisms of inhibition develop, the project will address long-standing debates in social cognition regarding the role of inhibition in development. Isolating the role of different inhibitory processes in children's social judgment specifies the mechanisms through which children develop social cognitive knowledge, and cognitive development more generally. Understanding how these processes unfold also applies to real-world practice. By examining how children understand others' mental states, the researchers will be able to provide a framework for describing how children resolve conflicts with others. By examining how children develop concepts of fairness, the researchers will be able to identify factors contributing to cooperation and moral development. These findings have the potential to impact curriculum design and interventions designed to promote social cognitive development. &lt;br/&gt;          &lt;br/&gt;This project uses a technique called reach trajectory tracking (RTT), which measures how children engage in reaching behaviors in response to scenes shown to them on a screen. Different mechanisms of inhibitory control are reflected by the speed and trajectory of children's reaching responses. Three lines of research in social cognition will be addressed: children's theory of mind, selective social learning, and prosocial behavior. Each line of research targets the developmental trajectory of a social-cognitive process and discerns the role of distinct inhibitory processes in that development. In this way, the research team can articulate ways in which children's social cognition develops and what role inhibition plays in this development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In the United States, approximately 90% of everything we consume on a daily basis is now shipped to us by sea. The stability of maritime commerce depends on a workforce of over 1.6 million international seafarers, the dynamics of which have yet to be fully mapped. In particular, we know little about whether the trends that we associate with the globalization, industrialization, and automation manifest within the maritime commerce industry. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous, scientifically grounded fieldwork, asks how the labor market that services this critical, yet understudied commercial space, is changing with increased automation, acceleration, and globalization of production. Research findings will be published in professional journals and presented at maritime conferences to create media exposure and foster exchanges between academia and the shipping industry regarding labor relations. Based on his findings, the researcher will also develop college-level curricular materials aimed to innovate higher education pedagogies and to disseminate critical anthropological knowledge of global supply chains to a diverse body of business, international law, and global studies students, thereby engaging a wider audience with the scientific process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liang Wu, under the supervision of Dr. Karen Strassler from the Department of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, will explore labor dynamics, human and capital mobility across maritime circuits of commerce. He will study contemporary seafarers working on board ocean-going container ships of the international shipping industry, the majority of whom are now outsourced from China, the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Russia, and Ukraine among other labor exporting countries. Research will be conducted with seafarers on board a container ship and in the ports of New York and Hong Kong as hubs of transatlantic and transpacific trades. Drawing on wide-ranging language skills and more than a decade of field experiences, the researcher will investigate seafarers' work routines and relationships on board, backgrounds and aspirations, job cycles, port duties, shore leave, port-based welfare facilities and services, and shipping infrastructures and logistics management. Methods include combination of ethnographic fieldwork on board a container ship and at the ports of Hong Kong and New York, as well as social network, geospatial, and other methods of data analysis.

But how did communities in the countryside experience vacillations between security and insecurity, resulting from alternating episodes of peace and conflict, and decades of climate stability followed by periods of drought? Drs. Charles Golden (Brandeis University), Andrew Scherer (Brown University), Timothy Murtha (University of Florida) together with colleagues in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will address this fundamental question. To address this question they will focus on the relationships among climate warfare and agricultural intensification. The research will provide a first step towards understanding the entanglement (or lack thereof) between war and the agricultural economy in the western Maya lowlands, with implications for understanding human-environmental and political dynamics more broadly. The natural and cultural resources of the Usumacinta River Basin in which the research will take place and other areas of the neotropics are being devastated by looting, illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture, and livestock management practices that can result in devastating wildfires in a landscape plagued in recent decades by drought. Understanding long-term uses of the landscape will help to address contemporary land use issues and assist in planning for sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research continues the investigators efforts to enhance understandings of ancient Maya defensive features and warfare generally and represents a new attempt to identify the potential economic causes and consequences of war for the ancient Maya.  The western Maya lowlands is an ideal case for the study of the relationship between social strife and agricultural production. With a robust epigraphic record and decades of archaeological fieldwork, the region hosted a diversity of polities in terms of their strategies of governance and socio-political integration. The proposed research will also advance understanding of ancient Maya agricultural systems. The study area is the wettest region of the Maya lowlands, where little work has considered agricultural dynamics over the long term. Such regional comparison is critical for synthetic statements about agricultural regimes that are often based on research conducted in the distinct ecological zones of the Central Peten, Belize, and northern Yucatan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Such understanding will be helpful in peacefully addressing world conflicts, negotiating business deals, and facilitating group interactions.  Westerners see themselves as independent agents, and they are individualistic in value. In contrast, some non-Western groups, such as people in Asia, and possibly those in Arab regions, Africa, and Latin America, often see themselves as interdependent with others in their groups and relations. They tend to be more collectivistic. This project investigates the ways that different non-Western groups develop their cultural styles of interdependence by utilizing different strategies of attaining this valued state. It is hypothesized, for example, that East Asians achieve interdependence by avoiding conflicts with others and attain social harmony within their groups. Arab people, on the other hand, do so by self-assertively resolving conflicts with others and by protecting their groups. By studying multiple cultural groups, we may be able to learn more about non-Western and Western cultures. Thus, this project can learn how Westerners typically assert themselves to express their individuality so that they can feel more esteemed and independent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test this framework, six studies will be conducted to identify the nuances involved in the interdependence-independence construct. The studies will assess three core features of interdependence vs. independence, including the primacy of personal versus social goals as predictors of happiness, analytic versus holistic attention, and analytic versus holistic social cognition. The research will also assess three pairs of subsidiary features that theoretically produce different styles of interdependence. In particular, the use of self-effacement vs. assertion, emotional suppression vs. expression, and dialectic vs. logical reasoning, can all produce different types of interdependence. Those strategies often arise from the ecological context of the cultures. Highly populated cites with greater commerce, for example, should produce more argumentative interdependence whereas more linguistically diverse areas should produce more emotional expressivity. The subsidiary features will be measured across a set of 16 cultural groups from South Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and across the Middle East, Africa, Western Europe, Latin America, and those groups will be contrasted to groups in North America. It is expected that there will be a broad divergence between the groups regarding the strategies they use to achieve their desired cultural state of independence and interdependence. It is also predicted that the West will differ from the non-West in core features while the non-West will be characterized relatively more in subsidiary features. Experimental tests will include priming manipulations designed to produce independence or interdependence to test their later effects on the subsidiary features. Results will shed light on how cultural groups utilize social interaction styles to produce independence and interdependence.

This project examines the effects of different kinds of grammar instruction with Mandarin-speaking learners of English, one of the largest English learner groups in the U.S. today. The results are expected to have implications for the grammar teaching of this population in English as a Second Language classrooms, and will contribute to the understanding of language learning as well as language instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how input/instruction affects Mandarin-speaking English second language learners' acquisition of English inverse scope, and whether learners can generalize the acquired knowledge from one structure to another. English allows inverse scope while Mandarin does not, and our preliminary findings suggest that Mandarin-speaking learners of English are not able to acquire English inverse scope based on naturalistic input alone. This project examines whether explicit instruction and/or input flooding can help learners acquire inverse scope; it further examines whether the learning effect is sustained over time. The scope interactions in two structures are examined: universal quantifier-negation scope (e.g. ""Every sheep did not jump over the fence"") and double-quantifier scope (e.g. ""A girl stroked every kitten""). In an intervention study, learners will be instructed on one of those structures, but tested on both, to see whether they can generalize their acquired knowledge to a different but related structure. Learners will be instructed by means of either explicit rule presentation or input flooding, to determine which is the most effective.

However, we have little understanding of how existing norms are shifted and new norms evolve, so that justice is seen to be done and cooperation furthered in the face of change. Many jurisdictions have adopted legal pluralism to bring about harmony at different levels of society with formal western-based law courts for administering retributive justice and customary courts negotiating compromise through restorative justice. This project explores the role of these public forums for restorative justice, which are optimal settings for understanding the dynamics of coalescing diverse opinions into norm shifts to maintain community cooperation despite rapid demographic, economic and social change. The project includes educational components that broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science, and improve the public's understanding of science. The research team will produce educational materials on courts and customs. The work is highly generalizable to other traditional court and restorative justice systems, which will contribute to the field at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study conducted by Dr. Polly Wiessner (Arizona State University and the University of Utah) and Mr. Nitze Pupu, J D (Enga Tradition and Transition Centre) will build on a decade of research observing and documenting over 1,000 customary court cases in village courts within and between the tribes of the Enga of Papua New Guinea since 2008. Customary courts are open air forums, manned by elected local leaders, have broad participation, and host extensive public discussion. They are sanctioned by the government for resolving conflicts and minor crimes, although they often mediate settlements for serious ones. The study will examine the processes and outcomes of the documented cases and continue to research new ones asking: (1) Which procedures, norms, and customs continue to bring about decisions that satisfy communities; which do not and why? (2) How are norms and values updated during public forums to address new realities, such as radically altered patterns of communication with mobile phones, changing norms in sexual relations and marriage, guns in warfare, and land inheritance? (3) How do community members assist in making up for harm done and bringing wrong-doers back into the fold as productive citizens? (4) What are rates of recidivism for different infractions?  (5) Why are customary courts often favored over formal courts? (6) How are the relations between the formal western-based courts and customary village courts altered in response to changing conditions and how are mismatches resolved to avoid legal dissonance? Methods proposed include the collection of court case data, follow-up data collection on compensation payment, follow-up interviews with participants in key cases (to include customary court officials, those involved in cases, and those that observed proceedings or contributed to restitution payments), follow-up data collection on recidivism, and finally workshops and focus groups with magistrates and customary court officials to get their perspective on changes in the customary court system over time. The PI plans to use content analysis methodologies to identify shifting norms around reproduction, production, and social support; as well as changing articulation with the formal courts. The research will contribute to better understanding of the articulation between local, regional, and national systems.

Yet, previous research on governmental investment plans stresses that the futures promised by ambitious state-planning often remain out of reach, given that expansive projects are rarely completed on time or as according to plan. Thus, state planning might equally be a source of hope and a source of fear for people impacted by the protracted implementation processes inherent to complex plans. With proposals to invest in the rebuilding of national infrastructure growing in popularity, both in the United States and in industrializing nations across the globe, an understanding of the ultimate effects of investment in long-term, large-scale infrastructure planning is urgently needed. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, the project would engage a wider audience in the scientific process, and broadly disseminate its findings to organizations invested in optimizing urban infrastructural planning.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvard University doctoral student Courtney T. Wittekind, advised by Dr. Jean Comaroff, will explore what strategies for investment, speculation, and planning are employed in the context of a large-scale infrastructural plan. Extended ethnographic research will be conducted in the city of Yangon (formerly Rangoon), Myanmar's cultural and economic center. As the site for an impressive state-led plan that proposes to expand the city by over 20,000 acres, Yangon is an ideal location for the study of the advantages and disadvantages of large-scale state-led planning. The researcher will focus on the Yangon region's southwestern outskirts, including three townships targeted for redevelopment by this city expansion plan. There, she will ask two sets of questions about the effects of large-scale infrastructural planning. The first set asks about the relationship between everyday decisions made by those living in the Yangon region's southwest, and their perception of the city expansion plan, its progress, and future potential. The second set of questions contextualizes the first within Myanmar's ongoing democratic transition, asking how people's impressions of municipal and regional planning relate to their perceptions of national politics. The researcher will collect data through ethnographic research, including participant observation, household surveys, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and archival analysis. The conclusions of this research will provide new insights into the relationships between planning occurring at the level of the individual, the municipality, and the nation, while also helping policymakers and civil society organizations better assess the promise of infrastructural investment, in light of its possible risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Research suggests that people track their language experience, and they know for example that the more common interpretation of ""ear"" is as a body part and not a piece of corn. But a lot less is known about how language experience changes the way we interpret larger chunks of discourse. For example, an important part of language understanding is interpreting reference. In ""Ana saw Liz. She waved"", people need to figure out whether ""She"" refers to Ana or Liz. Do people pay attention to the frequency of referential patterns, and use this to interpret ambiguous pronouns? Recent findings suggest they might. In our example, most people tend to assume that ""she"" refers to Ana, who is the subject of the previous clause. But this bias toward the subject is weakened if people have recently read many stories where the non-subject gets re-mentioned, as when the pronoun is rendered unambiguous in context by the gender of the discourse participants (e.g., Matt saw Lyn. She waved.). This suggests that people shift their strategies on the basis of the most frequent reference patterns in context. But researchers do not know exactly how these biases are learned. For example, do people learn biases separately for each verb or verb class, or do they assume that frequencies of reference can be generalized across sentence types? How much exposure is necessary, and of what type? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project tests these questions with adults. Participants read numerous ""priming"" stories that display one type of reference, for example where the subject character gets re-mentioned, or the non-subject character gets mentioned. The critical question is whether this changes the way people interpret ambiguous pronouns, like ""she"" in the Ana/Liz example above. All priming stories use unambiguous reference, for example in mixed-gender stories so the pronoun referent is clear. The first set of experiments tests the types of generalizations people draw, for example across verbs or verb types, or based on syntactic vs. semantic information. The second set of experiments tests the conditions necessary for learning, for example the amount or type of input needed. This project is one of the first studies to examine how the frequency of discourse structures influences the strategies people use for pronoun comprehension. This builds on other recent evidence that language comprehension strategies can be learned from the frequencies of language input. This project will help demonstrate how the mind uses statistics from the environment to shape cognitive processing. Results will be important for developing models of how higher-level language comprehension is influenced by experience, and for developing interventions to address problems with poor reading and listening comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Self-regulation is a key aspect of typical and atypical cognitive and social-emotional development. The project will advance basic knowledge about how the brain's frontal lobe develops to more effectively and efficiently regulate cardiac activity, and how this brain-heart coordination influences developmental improvements in self-regulation. As part of this effort, the project will test several foundational theories and establish novel brain imaging methods that will benefit developmental cognitive neuroscience and physiology research. Evidence of how brain and heart systems coordinate their functioning will move the field of research on early developing self-regulation toward a more integrated systems perspective. The project team will collaborate with local schools to (1)provide hands-on experiences involving tasks and games that assess brain and heart functioning, and (2)inform students how the nervous and cardiovascular systems work together to influence their learning. The team also will conduct professional development workshops on these topics with school personnel, to translate research results into teaching practices. More broadly, the results of the project will contribute to basic and practical knowledge about preschoolers' development that can be applied by early childhood educators and policymakers, to improve child development outcomes across the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyvagal and Neurovisceral Integration theories predict developmental changes in the coordination or integration of neural and cardiovascular factors that are essential to effective self-regulation. To test these theories, prior research has identified key developmental patterns and predictors in early childhood, but that work has generally focused on brain and cardiac factors separately rather than simultaneously. Therefore, this project will address gaps in knowledge about developmental changes in the associations between brain activity and heart rate variability (a key indicator of cardiac regulation), along with measures of cognitive and emotion regulation behaviors in early childhood. The study participants will be 200 children from an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse community that includes urban, suburban and rural settings. A cross-sectional design will involve comparing 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds. Children will visit the laboratory to complete cognitive and emotion regulation tasks, while neural and cardiac activity (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS] and electrocardiogram [ECG]) are both recorded. The study will identify how neural, cardiac, and behavioral indicators of self-regulation co-develop from 3-to-5-years of age. The project team hypothesizes that children with more advanced self-regulation skills will show stronger activation in specified frontal lobe brain regions as well as higher heart rate variability. In addition, the team hypothesizes that  neural, cardiac and behavioral self-regulation indicators will show either stronger associations (developmental integration), or weaker associations (developmental specialization), at older versus younger ages due to developmental changes. To test the hypotheses, the data will be analyzed using multivariate general linear and structural equation modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Understanding how sociolinguistic expectations are formed and accessed during expectation-driven accommodation contributes to a general understanding of how social stereotypes are formed, mentally represented, and utilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs a novel word-naming game paradigm designed to elicit tokens of /ay/ from participants while exposing them to Southern speech that contains no /ay/ tokens. Acoustic properties of participants' /ay/ tokens are compared before and after exposure to a Southern or Midland (control) talker to determine whether accommodation occurs. Experiment 1 investigates whether accommodation based on expectations alone occurs. Experiment 2 tests whether expectation-driven accommodation is socially or structurally rooted by manipulating social cues (dialect labels) and structural cues (linguistic variants). Experiment 3 uses a joint perception-production task to determine whether participants exhibit /ay/-category boundary shifts, and whether such perceptual shifts predict accommodative behavior. This task attempts to pinpoint the perceptual changes that must take place for accommodation to occur, as well as understand the role of social information in both early perceptual changes and subsequent production behaviors. Self-reported surveys are paired with all three experiment to gauge the influence of social, cognitive, and attitudinal measures in accommodative behavior. Results contribute to scientific understanding of the relationship between perception and linguistic production, as well as the mental relationships between social and linguistic knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, producing accurate measures of global health outcomes is acutely challenging, due to both the lack of quality global health data, and the difficulty of producing universal measures for well-being, cost, and other factors that may vary by region. In recent years, the world's foremost global epidemiology study, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, has initiated global collaborative efforts to bolster the objectivity and universality of their data and measures. The research supported by this award investigates the grounded micro-practices of these global collaborative efforts in order to understand how  global experts use numbers and data technologies to craft scientific consensus and common understandings across cultural contexts. The findings of this research will be disseminated in such a way to aid researchers and policy-makers better understand how large-scale international data collaborations may operate as venues for forging common understandings, negotiating global social goals and projects, and improving the universality and accuracy of health measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses anthropological methods to investigate the social  and technical micro-practices of global collaboration for the GBD study. The researcher will conduct participant observation and interviews  with researchers at the institutional home of the GBD study, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, Washington, as well as with their 3,500 global collaborators . The researcher will also conduct historical and semiotic analyses of the quantification procedures used by the GBD study over time in order to evaluate how experts balance scientific, ethical, and social considerations and goals while producing and reviewing health data. In addition to training a graduate student in the methods of social science research, this research will contribute to interdisciplinary efforts to understand the social dynamics of global scientific collaboration and the various ways that social goals and values influence the design and measurement of global health data. Research results will be used to create education materials that will help the public better understand the social and scientific significance and functions of specific measures and data technologies in global health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Rather than seeking understanding of others, people often shut out, talk over, or even spew hatred at people who do not share their own perspectives. This ""empathy gap"" reflects a tendency for empathy to break down in situations where people are in conflict or feel different from each other. This research tests ways to reduce this empathy gap by focusing on how people understand their own empathy. Does the belief that empathy can be developed motivate people to empathize with those who have differing perspectives? By examining how people's beliefs about empathy influence their interactions with members of other groups, this project offers insights into promoting more open-minded interactive dialogue and reducing intergroup polarization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the concept of empathic effort, which is the willingness to invest time and cognitive energy into understanding and relating to members of a different thought group. The project uses diverse methods and nationally representative samples to examine how to foster empathic effort. The research tests (a) whether a growth mindset of empathy (the belief that one can develop empathy) and a dynamic norm of empathy (the belief that a growing number of people think interparty empathy is important) combine to promote empathic effort toward outgroup members, (b) whether empathetic effort and feelings of empathy toward an outgroup member produce less hostility toward the broader outgroup, and (c) whether receiving empathic effort from an outgroup member encourages empathic effort from the recipient and reduces the recipient's hostility toward the broader outgroup. Messages that teach a growth mindset of empathy and dynamic norm of empathic effort could be delivered broadly and across multiple intergroup contexts.  As a result, the research offers insight into addressing the empathy gap between those with different perspectives and other intergroup contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Understanding the nature of these age of acquisition effects on sentence structure can illuminate the underlying mechanisms of the critical period for language development and provide clinicians and educators with important information about the nature of language deprivation in deaf students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The current proposal examines the effects of early language deprivation on language processing at the basic phrasal level. The participants are deaf adults and adolescents who experienced minimal early language and began to acquire American Sign Language (ASL) as their first language (L1) later in life. Study 1 investigates longitudinal development of basic word order in four case studies. Study 2 investigates whether late L1 learners rely on syntactic cues or use alternative strategies when comprehending and producing simple mono-clausal sentences using a sentence-picture verification task and an elicited word order production task. The participants are a group of deaf late L1 learners (n = 10, Age of Acquisition, AoA &gt; 8) and a control group of deaf native signers (n = 10). Study 3 investigates these phenomena with adolescents who are deaf native signers (n = 10) and late L1 learners with early AoA (n = 10, AoA 4-6), as well as adolescents who are late L1 learners (AoA 8-10). This manipulation of AoA investigates the questions of 1) whether childhood vs adolescent L1 AoA has different effects on sentence processing strategies and 2) when late L1 learners reach a stable stage of processing basic phrasal structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This lack of knowledge about effects of human interaction over very long time scales makes it difficult to understand why our ecosystems look the way they do, and why and how certain social structures and economies evolve. It also hampers our ability to know how our ecosystems will respond to changed conditions in the future, and what we should do when species are endangered. When a plant or animal faces endangerment or extinction, we are often quick to assume its because of habitat loss, or overexploitation; yet sometimes, especially with plants, it may be due to the loss of an important seed disperser. If people have interacted with wild fruit for thousands of years, and affected its distribution by dispersing seed, then the loss of that species may be the result of the loss of that human interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores how contemporary hunter gatherers interact with plants to better understand the long human pre-agricultural history of environmental change. The research team is working with indigenous hunter-gatherers of Australia's Western Desert (Traditional Owners of Martu and Kulyakartu homelands) to ask how foraging, patterns of movement, and the use of fire has shaped the distribution and genetic diversity of wild tomatoes (Solanum diversiflorum). By understanding how hunter-gatherers have shaped plant distributions over thousands of years in the absence of agriculture, we may gain better insights into management strategies to prevent extinction and decline in the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

As transport options are rapidly changing and as new transport infrastructures are being planned in cities across the world, we still know very little about how these changes to transport systems are affecting those who work in the transport industry and how economic, political, and labor relationships in cities are being affected by these changes. This anthropological project will address this gap. Through a fine-grained study of the transport industry the project will seek to understand how changes in transport infrastructure can have impacts on many aspects of life in a city. The data gleaned from the research would also inform and advance policy in urban planning by offering researchers, planners and public officials insights into the factors that enable and inhibit urban mobility. The project specifically includes dissemination activities targeted at transport policy-makers and urban planners in the United States and globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tarini Bedi of the University of Illinois at Chicago will explore how stakeholders, including urban planners, transport labor, and urban citizens engage with the changes in urban transport infrastructure. The research will be conducted in two cities, the Indian city of Mumbai and the Southeast Asian city of Singapore. These cities are both ideal laboratories for exploring questions of transport infrastructure because of several new major transport infrastructure initiatives and investments in Mumbai and because the city of Singapore's transport planning has become a model for cities in Asia, Europe, and the United States. The researcher will conduct twenty-four months of research across these two cities using a range of ethnographic data collection and analytical techniques, including participant observation and interviews with urban transport planners, transport labor, municipal officials, and investors in transport and road infrastructures. The project will make important contributions to debates in anthropology, transport policy, labor studies, and political economy more broadly.

For example, if Pat is reaching for a cookie, for example, we might expect Pat's mother to say ""Pat broke the jar"". However, Pat might prefer to say ""The jar broke"", or even ""My sister made me break the jar"". In other words, Pat might choose a grammatical strategy that obscures the breaker and the broken object (the two participants in the event) for a reason like avoiding punishment.  Such changes in the expression of participants are known as valence alternations. While probably all languages have strategies to manipulate valence, they vary in how they do this: which participants can be added or subtracted, in what conditions, and with what linguistic resources. To achieve the deepest understanding of how this works, linguists must investigate languages which vary significantly from English, including languages which use a greater number of suffixes and prefixes on verbs. This project will contribute to these questions through an exploration of valence alternations in an as yet understudied indigenous South American language, Mocov&amp;#237;, which unlike English displays highly complex verbal morphology. Broader impacts will include the training of community members and undergraduate students in linguistic documentation and description, the creation of community pedagogical resources, and the training of a dissertation student. The corpus will be accessible to scholars and the general public via the Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America. More broadly, this work contributes to the scholarship on Argentina's indigenous cultural heritage. By supporting indigenous language maintenance through activities such as the preparation of illustrated booklets for Mocov&amp;#237; primary schools, this project will also continue the strong binational ties between Argentina and the U.S. in the areas of educational and scientific collaboration. In particular, this research will benefit from the close cooperation between the Universidad Nacional del Nordeste (Argentina) and The University of Texas at Austin (U.S.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an in-depth investigation of valence alternations in the central-northern variety of Mocov&amp;#237; [moc], an underexplored Guaycuruan language spoken in northeastern Argentina. Linguists still have much to understand regarding how the manipulation of participants interacts with other aspects of a language's grammar, and how these resources develop over time. Where in English, speakers tend to add words like ""make"" to increase valence, languages with complex verbal morphology, like Mocov&amp;#237;, often leverage different resources, such as combinations of verbal affixes. Mocov&amp;#237;'s valence-adjusting mechanisms involve the stacking of verbal suffixes according to strategies that are very different from those seen in well-studied European languages. Fieldwork will be carried out by a local team formed by two Mocov&amp;#237; community members and the co-PI, a doctoral student at The University of Texas at Austin, and will create a robust corpus of naturalistic speech across discourse types, together with elicited data focusing on transitivity alternations. The integrated exploration of both types of data allows assessment of possible differences in transitivity-related phenomena across genre, style, etc., among other questions.

Detailed instrumental studies of nasal phenomena have been limited primarily to languages that are easily accessible to linguists based in laboratories, which has resulted in a focus on languages with relatively homogenous nasality systems. However, a diverse and comparatively complex set of nasal phenomena, such as complex consonants like [bmb] and [nt], or phonological processes such as nasal harmony, in which the nasality associated with one speech sound can spread across an entire word, have been described for languages spoken in communities more distant from phonetics laboratories. Several aspects of nasality in these languages pose challenges for current scientific theories regarding the cognitive/phonological representations of these sounds, which have been developed primarily on the basis of a geographically biased sample of languages. By studying nasal speech sounds in indigenous languages of South America, which exhibit an unusually rich and diverse set of nasal phenomena,  this project promises to yield important theoretical insights into the relationship between the gradient nature of production of speech sounds and their discrete cognitive/phonological categorization, one of the central issues in the scientific investigation of human speech sound systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-researcher project takes advantage of recent technological advances that have made equipment for studying nasal phenomena more portable.

Linguistic factors include surface-level cues such as a speaker's choice of lexical items and the syntactic structure of the question. Extra-linguistic factors include the discourse context and the speaker's goals in asking the question. The project will address theoretical proposals regarding the division of labor between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in question-answer dynamics, and will provide empirical data that bear on debates concerning what licenses certain kinds of answers to certain kinds of questions. The proposed research seeks to integrate corpus, psycholinguistic and developmental methods, and computational modeling in a novel way. The project will provide valuable opportunities for undergraduate students, from experimental design and running to the presentation of results in scholarly venues. The researchers will disseminate these results through academic conferences and publications, and engage in community outreach events. Both the existing connections between the researchers and colleagues in cognitive and computer science, and the proposed implementation of these results in a computational model ensure that the results of the research will be applicable to work in dialogue research, concerning the design of intelligent conversational agents for AI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While previous work on questions has focused primarily on the nature of exhaustive answers, what licenses non-exhaustive (or mention-some) answers, which are frequent in natural dialogue, has gone under-investigated.

This research uses a three-pronged interdisciplinary approach, combining tools from experimental linguistics, developmental psychology, and computer science, gathering empirical data from natural language corpora and psycholinguistic and developmental studies, and capturing the findings in a computational model. Corpus data inform us about what speakers actually do. Adult psycholinguistic studies inform us about what is allowed and assessed as likely or unlikely. Developmental studies inform us about the trade-off between semantics and pragmatics, and the role of the input. A computational model aims to capture these data in a probabilistic framework.

One of the clearer sites for examining the complexities of human kin relations is with the social relations between non-consanguine adoptive kin. In some cases, for example, prospective parents express adoption as a religious experience, as opposed to a humanitarian endeavor or simply a wish to add to their existing families. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, explores the relationship between religion and transnational adoption.

This research will be centered in Uganda, an ideal natural laboratory for studying changes in transnational adoption as rates were rapidly rising until the Children Amendment Act made it significantly more difficult for foreigners to adopt children. Despite increasing obstacles, which include residing in Uganda for over one year in order to legally adopt an eligible child, some devout Christians remain committed to the adoption process in this particular country. In investigation whether their religion is inspiring them to live away from their family and in more austere conditions than in the United States or other Western countries, this project will examine how faith is being used to form families at an orphanage in Kampala. This project will use ethnographic methods, including participant observation, life history collection, and formal interviews, in order to comprehend the religiosity of adoption. Doing so will enable an understanding of adoption beyond the current debates that situate it as morally right or wrong, offering new insight into the future of the practice. Archival research will also be used explore how this context emerged as one sought out by Western missionaries, and eventually a place from where they chose to adopt children.

Research shows that the harmful effects of negative emotions are greater among Americans compared to East Asians. This project focuses on understanding how negative emotions assert their negative influence. It considers whether the way a person views and interprets negative emotions influences the effects of those emotions. One theory is that unfavorable beliefs about negative emotions make those negative emotions more harmful. The primary hypothesis is that negative emotions per se are not negative. How people respond to those negative emotions, however, produces the negative outcomes. Research suggests that Americans, compared to East Asians, view negative emotions as more harmful. Such differences in how people think about negative emotions produce the negative outcomes.

With language technology now more than ever forming a central part of our daily lives, the difficulty of reproducing this type of easy, fluid language processing in computer software is evident. The need to understand how human minds and brains successfully deploy language in everyday situations thus remains as pressing as ever. Psycholinguistics approach this question by bringing together insights from Linguistics, Psychology, and Computer Science.

Recent research has raised awareness to the multiple effects of these new businesses and the technologies they develop. They have impacted multiple sectors, such as the hospitality industry, transportation, logistics, and retail. Moreover, these startups work with venture capital and private equity, attracting aggressive investing behaviors. Although we typically associate these transformations in urban spaces, startups are now becoming important in the rural world.

Most languages, like English, primarily combine these units by linearly appending them to one another (e.g. re- + write -&gt; rewrite); such languages are said to have linear morphology. Semitic languages, like Arabic, are famous for having nonlinear morphology: discontinuous units which express meaning and grammatical information are combined non-linearly (e.g. Arabic k-t-b 'writing' + aa-i 'doer, NOUN' -&gt; kaatib 'author'). Maltese is particularly unusual in its morphological characteristics: as a Semitic language, Maltese has primarily used non-linear morphology historically. However, for the past millennium it has been in close contact with a series of languages that use linear morphology (Sicilian, Italian, French, and English), and speakers have heavily borrowed words and adopted linear morphological strategies from these languages. Today, Maltese comprises a ""mixed"" language: at least half of all words are borrowed from non-Semitic languages (and so do not exhibit non-linear morphology), and speakers use both linear and non-linear word-building strategies extensively. This project investigates how the presence of distinct morphological systems in Maltese affects word processing, exploring differences in how Maltese readers recognize Semitic words vs. non-Semitic borrowings. It explores the impact of historical language mixing on the processes underlying daily language use, and so has implications for the study of languages in similar contact situations. The results of a series of experiments will comprise the data analyzed in the Co-PI's dissertation. The project will also produce a database of Maltese word recognition data, the first such database for a language with non-linear morphology, which other researchers may use to study language processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Co-PI, a doctoral student at the University of Arizona, will conduct a series of psycholinguistic experiments investigating how the existence of distinct lexicons exhibiting unique morphological characteristics (native Semitic words vs. non-Semitic borrowings) affects visual word recognition in Maltese. Previous research has found (1) that Maltese readers are faster to recognize Semitic words than non-Semitic borrowings and (2) that, when primed by letter strings consisting of a subset of a word?s consonants (e.g. frx primes FIREX 'to spread'), they are faster to recognize Semitic words (for which such strings comprise a morpheme) but not non-Semitic ones (for which such strings are non-morphemic). The latter finding conflicts with the ""subset priming"" effect found in non-Semitic languages, namely that exposure to such letter strings typically facilitates word recognition (e.g. 'csn' primes CASINO), owing to the role of consonant letters in constraining lexical candidates, and suggests that language-specific morphological properties such as Semitic nonconcatenative morphology may further shape the role of consonant letters in lexical processing. The proposed research includes (1) a Maltese visual lexical decision megastudy which explores processing differences between Semitic and non-Semitic words across a wide range of items when potential confounding factors like orthographic neighborhood density and morphological structure are controlled for (and which will result in the publication of a database of Maltese lexical decision responses) (Experiment 1); and (2) a series of visual masked priming studies which test for subset priming effects in non-Semitic Maltese words when confounding factors, namely the morphemic status of the prime, are controlled for (Experiments 2-3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Death is a universal human experience, but funeral practices, which honor the dead vary widely across human cultures. Researching these customs can thus shed light on many aspects of social life in a given society. In the United States, commercial death care is remarkably uniformed, yet it remains one of the most racially segregated sectors of the economy. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis, asks why this is the case, and what African American funeral practices can reveal how race has shaped American society. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, the project would engage a wider audience in the scientific process. Findings will be widely disseminated to organizations and individuals in the funerary and mortuary science professions. This project broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LaShaya Howie, under the supervision of Dr. Shannon Dawdy of the University of Chicago, asks what factors contribute to the racial dynamics of funerary and mortuary practices in the U.S. Funeral practices have become increasingly homogenous across American society since the Civil War, particularly through the last century with advances in mortuary technology. African American funeral and mortuary practices have historically been highly specialized as an industry, and have remained so long after the end of segregation. The researcher explores the role that culture and race have in sustaining that specialization. Field work will be conducted in sites of mortuary and funerary practice on the southside of Chicago, a context long known for its role in shaping and representing African American life. Because of variability in the circumstances surrounding death, there is richer data set from which to analyze funeral practices in these communities. The researcher has conducted research there since 2016, having established and maintained important institutional and personal contacts that will facilitate detailed data collection and produce significant research findings. She will focus on professionals who work in African American funeral homes and related places, such as churches and cemeteries, and who participate in professional organizations for death care providers. Funeral workers retrieve bodies; cremate or embalm them; communicate with insurance companies and government agencies; and, when requested, guide loved ones through planning and conducting funeral and memorial services. Given the persistent racial separation in death care, this project?s researchers will assess how Black funeral professionals and their customers define Black funeral practices to determine what they consider unique. They will also examine how these descriptions are related to the way people think about race in the United States more generally. And because the corpse has been a central part of mortuary customs, the investigators will also assess the changing significance of the corpse in Black funeral service as the rising popularity of cremation challenges the more common American tradition of embalming and burial. Methods, include observational research in a variety of funerary settings (funeral services at funeral homes, churches, and meetings as families make funeral arrangements), interviews with funeral professionals, and overseeing panel discussions and events at national funeral conventions where attendees discuss pertinent issues, challenges, and changes in the business in order to make comparisons between what is observed in the Chicago area and in other locations across the U.S. and abroad. Findings from this research will provide insight into what American funeral practices are today and how they are evolving. This research will thereby provide valuable insights about American society through its death practices and what they may teach us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

With mounting concern over the availability and security of fossil fuels, much scholarly and public attention has been paid to finding alternatives for petroleum-based fuels. However, less attention has been paid to finding alternatives for petroleum-based chemicals, used to manufacture of a vast array of everyday items. In the past decade, some scientists have worked to develop an alternative to petroleum-based chemicals: the same chemicals made from sugarcane. This is one example of a category of biotechnologies aiming to utilize crops to manufacture a wide range of products not imaginable even only a decade ago. Nonetheless, questions remain as to whether these plant-based alternative materials are more socially, environmentally, and economically viable than the petroleum-based originals. As the United States and other countries continue to invest millions of dollars into this kind of biotechnology and alternative manufacturing research, it will be critical to understand what social, historical, and economic factors would make plant-based petroleum replacements feasible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kathleen Ulrich, under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Ballestero of Rice University, will explore the social, economic, and historical dimensions of post-petroleum biotechnological development. Research will be conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where in the past decade an unprecedented amount of scientific funding has been allocated to sugarcane-based product development. This is also a particularly notable research setting because Brazil is the top producer of sugarcane in the world, and the country was originally built upon the slave-based sugarcane industry starting in the sixteenth century. The investigators will examine how sugarcane scientists, state funding agents, and sugar factory workers in Sao Paulo conceive, develop, and implement sugarcane as a petroleum replacement. The investigators will assess to what extent these actors understand the historical, social, economic, and environmental characteristics of sugarcane in Brazil as positively or negatively impacting the feasibility of making sugarcane-based petroleum replacements. The investigators will carry out participant observation, interviews, focus groups, and surveys among the sugarcane scientists, funding agents, and sugar factory workers. This research will increase understandings of how biotechnology, manufacturing, and agriculture are coming together in new ways in the twenty-first century. Findings from this research will be crucial to formulating socially, economically, and environmentally responsible policies around plant-based manufacturing practices in the future. Furthermore, this research will contribute to efforts to improve cross-disciplinary collaborations between social scientists and biologists with the aim of better understanding and communicating to the public the social implications of new biotechnologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Over the past two decades, welfare reform in the U.S. has significantly diminished public assistance for marginalized populations. At the same time, ""resilience-building"" has become a national strategy for enabling communities to withstand, adapt to, or recover from adversity. However, the goals of resilience-building appear paradoxical in contexts like Flint, where the crisis remains ongoing, adversity is chronic, and the imperative to thrive coincides directly with austerity policies that continue to severely decrease welfare provision for residents. This project, which provides funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, will examine how the goals of resilience-building intersect with the ways that people experience, understand, and manage adversity in Flint, this project will provide key insight into the relationship between welfare state retrenchment, adversity-management, and collective life in the contemporary U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talia Gordon, a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, will conduct 18 months of ethnographic research in Flint, Michigan, with the oversight of Dr. Eugene Raikhel. A former hub of automotive manufacturing, Flint has become a national symbol of post-industrial decline. The 2014 water crisis drew further attention to the devastating consequences of continued disinvestment by state and federal administrations in an already socioeconomically disadvantaged community. In response to the crisis, the U.S. government expressed a commitment to support Flint's ""recovery and resilience."" Since 2016, this commitment has materialized in a number of initiatives specifically dedicated to building resilience in Flint. To understand why and to what consequence resilience-building has become the primary strategy for helping individuals and communities manage adversity in the postwelfare U.S., the researcher will conduct participant-observation across an array of sites dedicated to adversity-management in Flint. Findings from these sites will be enriched through ethnographic interviews with residents and other social actors involved in adversity-management practices; contextualized through analyses of discourse at each site; and supplemented by analyses of local news media, curricula, pamphlets, and online sources. The researcher will focus on 1) how resilience-building discourses and practices are enacted; that is, made socially meaningful 2) how these discourses and practices correspond with or diverge from local experiences and understandings of adversity and 3) how local value-frameworks inform adversity management. Findings from this research will contribute to understanding how and to what effects resilience-building discourses and practices are taken up by people in marginalized communities.

This has caused tensions between the newly arrived Haitian ethnic group and the historically established African Americans. Residents of both ethnicities note that these tensions begin in middle school. This longitudinal study follows a set of new sixth grade students through their first year at a middle school. These participants will need to learn the middle school community's expectations of acceptable racial and ethnic interactions and they will need to join or create social groups that either uphold or abandon these social expectations. As they are adapting to these social expectations, they will be subtly changing their speech to show solidarity with their own social groups and to create social distance from other groups. The life stage of these middle school participants is incredibly important for their own growth into adolescent and adult members of their communities which, in turn, is important for the further development of the societies to which they belong. This work will advance the scientific understanding of how youths learn social expectations and apply that knowledge to their own linguistic behaviors. It will also expand research on language variation by applying previous knowledge to understudied, diverse social groups. This study's broader impacts include publicly available recordings of youth speech, a workshop on language variation and ethnic bullying for teachers and administration in the middle school, and the dissemination of the sociolinguistic knowledge to the general public via press releases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoPI, a doctoral student at the Ohio State University, will conduct ethnographic fieldwork in a Miami middle school concentrating the data collection and analysis on a set of 20 to 30 sixth grade students belonging to the same homeroom. This project focuses on the ethnic make-up of the social groups of African and Haitian American students and quantifies the changes in speech that these new students experience as they become enmeshed into the middle school's particular social environment. Two dependent linguistic variables will be analyzed for this project: 3rd person singular verbal-s absence and prosodic rhythm. 3rd person singular verbal-s will be coded as present or absent for each present tense, present reference phrase. A number of factors that influence -s usage, such as verb type and sentence structure, will also be coded. Prosodic rhythm will be measured using a host of established rhythm measures (PVI, %V, &amp;#8710;C, and varcoC). These two linguistic variables have been shown to vary because of bilingualism and social identity; as a result, this project has two primary independent variables: language background and social network. This project employs a mixed methodological approach that is becoming more common in linguistic anthropological and sociolinguistic work. It includes diverse data collection methods: participant observation, audio-recorded linguistic and ethnographic interviews, network analysis, and a language background questionnaire.

Globally, the prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled since 1980. One population at increased risk for OO is immigrants. However, we still have a limited understanding of how exposures to stressors over the migration process interact with the life course to impact risk for OO. OO increases risks for chronic diseases and the economic cost of obesity-related illnesses is estimated at $190.2 billion annually in the U. S.  Immigrants are increasingly at risk for OO, and an estimated 18% of the US population will be immigrants within 50 years. Africans are now the fastest growing immigrant group, roughly doubling in number every decade. Despite their growing numbers, less is known about the factors that increase risk for OO among African immigrants. Africans are more likely than immigrants from most other regions to come to the United States as refugees or to seek asylum, and also have a higher prevalence of pre-migration traumatic events. This is significant because studies have shown trauma exposure and psychological distress increase the risk for OO. This training from the Cultural Anthropology Scholars Award will allow Dr. Covington-Ward to explore these questions and develop the methodological skills necessary to publish several articles based on secondary analysis of datasets, eventually conduct a larger, multi-sited project (post funded training) combining quantitative and qualitative data analysis, contribute to the pedagogical and research programs of several departments at her university, and share her research with local communities and scholarly audiences. This project also has broader implications for improved health policy, as the results will identify risk factors for obesity for African immigrants and suggest strategies for supporting these and other immigrant populations towards better health and well-being. The project will also contribute to science in regards to examining how exposure to trauma and stress increases obesity risk overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Covington-Ward of the University of Pittsburgh will investigate the following research questions: How do stressful and traumatic events before your move, during your move, and after your move impact obesity?

Southwestern Ojibwe is a revitalizing indigenous language spoken by approximately 5,000 first and second language speakers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Southern Ontario. Its grammar has been researched for decades, but little is known about how speakers produce and understand Ojibwe sentences during normal language comprehension and production. This is the focus of current project. Specifically, this research addresses the question of whether listeners use Ojibwe-specific grammatical cues to make predictions about how the meaning of the sentence will resolve, focusing on what types of information Ojibwe speakers use to identify the grammatical subject of a sentence. This project joins a small but growing body of research that looks at endangered and understudied languages using experimental fieldwork, and expands our understanding of how the cognitive capabilities common to all humans are used to produce and comprehend languages that differ in how their grammar expresses meaning. Furthermore, the results of this research will be shared with the Southwestern Ojibwe-speaking community to bolster language revitalization efforts.<br/><br/>All languages can refer to both living (animate) and non-living (inanimate) entities, and have different ways of conveying the importance of different characters in a story. However, Ojibwe is unique in that these functions play a central role in the grammar of the language.  In Ojibwe, nouns get different grammatical markers according to whether they refer to animate or inanimate entities. Furthermore, animate nouns participate in a unique ""spotlighting"" system. When there are multiple animate nouns in a story, conversation, or discourse, one of them is designated proximate (the character in the spotlight), while all others are marked obviative (the characters outside of the spotlight). Ojibwe further differs from languages like English in that word order does not serve as the primary cue for understanding the meaning of a sentence. Instead, Ojibwe has a complex system where the form of agreement on the verb and the animacy/obviation information on nouns are used together to understand the meaning of a sentence. The proposed study will look at how Ojibwe speakers use these sources of information to understand who is doing a particular action, and who is undergoing an action. Two methods will be employed. First, a language production task, where speakers are given an incomplete sentence preamble and are asked to use it to form a complete sentence, will be used to determine what assumptions speakers make about the grammatical role of ambiguous nouns. Second, a language comprehension task where participants will listen to sentences in Ojibwe while looking at an array of pictures corresponding to different interpretations of the sentence. Participants' eye movements will be recorded to understand how the interpretation of the sentence unfolds and changes over time in response to the input. The proposed study is the first of its kind on Ojibwe, and will be of interest to linguists interested in the cognitive representation of language, and to community members interested in revitalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Understanding the structure and organization of the human lexicon is critical to both linguistic and psycholinguistic theories of language. However, current theories are predominantly built upon evidence from spoken languages, and may underrepresent characteristics that are particularly common to sign languages. For example, a core assumption regarding the organization of the lexicon is that there is a sharp separation between semantic structure and phonological (form) structure--the way words are pronounced is generally thought to be unrelated to what they mean. However, mounting evidence suggests that iconicity, words or signs that resemble their meaning, is pervasive in both signed and spoken languages. Examples of iconicity in English are words like ""ping"" and ""sizzle"" that sound like what they mean; examples of iconicity in ASL are signs like DRINK and HAMMER which look like what they mean. While semantic and phonological structure might not be fully independent from each other in ASL, we know relatively little about how they relate to one another and whether or how iconicity may shape the lexicon. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project represents the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of the semantic organization of the ASL lexicon. The project will collect valuable information about the semantic similarity of ASL signs and the size of semantic neighborhoods, which will be key to uncovering how knowledge about sign meaning is stored and organized, as well as how this structure is acquired. Specifically, this project aims to 1) conduct a lexicon-wide evaluation of the semantic associations between signs, 2) characterize iconic and non-iconic systematic relationships between form and meaning using visualization techniques inspired by network science, and 3) implement a novel approach to quantify iconicity in a subset of the lexicon in an effort to understand which semantic features participate in iconic mappings and how iconicity might shape semantic processing. The data collected under this project will be integrated into a large interactive lexical database of the semantic, phonological, and iconic structure that is publicly available (ASL-LEX: http://asl-lex.org/). These materials constitute essential tools that will allow scientists and educators to create well-controlled stimuli for use in research and the classroom. Finally, it is important to recognize that deaf people often have difficulty pursuing research careers because of communication roadblocks that hamper interaction with hearing scientists. The researchers on this project have ""deaf-friendly labs"" (e.g., project staff are fluent in ASL) and provide training that facilitates the entrance of deaf students into scientific and academic fields.

This semantic structure is thought to be crucially important for many day-to-day activities, including learning in formal and informal settings, because it allows access to and use of stored knowledge across many different contexts. Prior studies suggest that there are marked individual differences in semantic structure based on factors such as age and expertise in specific domains. However, paucity of methods appropriate for studying semantic structure in young children makes it challenging to gain insight into changes in semantic structure with experience and learning during several key developmental periods, including the preschool years and transition into formal schooling. Using recent advances in the measurement of structured semantic knowledge in young children, this project will further our understanding of how learning and experience in real-world settings (such as a summer camp at a local botanical garden) promote rapid changes in children's semantic networks. The results of this project will have implications for our understanding of many cognitive processes thought to rely on structured semantic knowledge, including memory encoding and retrieval, attention, reading comprehension, and learning in formal and informal settings. Therefore, the results of this project have the potential to provide novel evidence pointing to the importance of enrichment experiences (such as field trips and summer camps) to children's academic achievement. The findings from this project will be disseminated to academic audiences and also to parents and educators in the community. Therefore, this project will provide opportunities to engage members of the public in conversations about improving the scientific literacy of children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are (1) to develop and validate developmentally-appropriate methods to study semantic structure in children, (2) to directly test theoretically-driven predictions about the learning mechanisms promoting changes in semantic structure in a real-world setting, and (3) to examine how changes in semantic structure promote changes in inferential comprehension, a cognitive process that is a component of reading comprehension. In Study 1, the researchers will develop and validate new methods to study semantic structure in children aged 4-9 years, and in so doing will examine how changes in semantic structure across a number of early acquired domains of knowledge (e.g., animals, clothes, foods) are related to changes in the ability to make inferences in those domains. In Studies 2 and 3, the research team will partner with a local botanical garden to directly test how different aspects of children's informal learning experiences contribute to changes in semantic structure and thereby affect children's inferential comprehension. The results of this project will provide the research community with new methods of studying semantic networks in children and will provide new insights into the importance of enrichment experiences for semantic development, including aspects of semantic development that are relevant for school success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Understanding the structure and organization of the human lexicon is critical to both linguistic and psycholinguistic theories of language. However, current theories are predominantly built upon evidence from spoken languages, and may underrepresent characteristics that are particularly common to sign languages. For example, a core assumption regarding the organization of the lexicon is that there is a sharp separation between semantic structure and phonological (form) structure--the way words are pronounced is generally thought to be unrelated to what they mean. However, mounting evidence suggests that iconicity, words or signs that resemble their meaning, is pervasive in both signed and spoken languages. Examples of iconicity in English are words like ""ping"" and ""sizzle"" that sound like what they mean; examples of iconicity in ASL are signs like DRINK and HAMMER which look like what they mean. While semantic and phonological structure might not be fully independent from each other in ASL, we know relatively little about how they relate to one another and whether or how iconicity may shape the lexicon. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project represents the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of the semantic organization of the ASL lexicon. The project will collect valuable information about the semantic similarity of ASL signs and the size of semantic neighborhoods, which will be key to uncovering how knowledge about sign meaning is stored and organized, as well as how this structure is acquired. Specifically, this project aims to 1) conduct a lexicon-wide evaluation of the semantic associations between signs, 2) characterize iconic and non-iconic systematic relationships between form and meaning using visualization techniques inspired by network science, and 3) implement a novel approach to quantify iconicity in a subset of the lexicon in an effort to understand which semantic features participate in iconic mappings and how iconicity might shape semantic processing. The data collected under this project will be integrated into a large interactive lexical database of the semantic, phonological, and iconic structure that is publicly available (ASL-LEX: http://asl-lex.org/). These materials constitute essential tools that will allow scientists and educators to create well-controlled stimuli for use in research and the classroom. Finally, it is important to recognize that deaf people often have difficulty pursuing research careers because of communication roadblocks that hamper interaction with hearing scientists. The researchers on this project have ""deaf-friendly labs"" (e.g., project staff are fluent in ASL) and provide training that facilitates the entrance of deaf students into scientific and academic fields. Thus, a parallel aim of the project is to increase the representation of deaf people in science by including deaf researchers on the project and by providing an accessible environment for deaf students to gain training and research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Nutritional science has already extensively demonstrated that the disappearance of traditional foods is disadvantageous to society because of the health, environmental and economic benefits they offer. The loss can be acutely detrimental, as it has been in the U.S., as the replacement of traditional diets has aggravated an obesity epidemic. Recently, the promotion of traditional diets has re-surfaced as part of initiatives advocating sustainable diets. There is, however, a need to understand how the knowledge and practice of such traditional food systems are lost, kept or modified. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, the project would engage a wider audience in the scientific process, and broadly disseminate its findings to organizations invested in optimizing agricultural production technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melanie Narciso, under the direction of Dr. Virginia Nazarea, will investigate the repercussions of agricultural modernization on traditional food knowledge and practice. This proposed research focuses on the culinary and gastronomic impact of a large-scale agricultural modernization, the Green Revolution (GR), through the study of fermented rice traditions in the Philippines. Starting in the 1960s, the GR introduced modern rice varieties, fast-maturing, pest and disease resistant and high yielding rice varieties in rice societies across the globe. These have been reported to replace traditional rice varieties, narrowing the genetic rice base and revolutionizing the rice landscape's tastes, odors, and textures. This research questions if the resulting genetic erosion and sensory transitions are merely inert phenomena without social ramifications. It specifically explores whether, and if so, to what extent material manipulation of yield varieties translate into traditional food knowledge loss. Using a combination of ethnography and food and nutritional science methodologies, the investigators will probe into the changes in the diversity and physico-chemical properties of the rice supply in the town of Candaba, a GR technology adopting rice farming community known for its fermented rice traditions. They will explore how these changes in material properties of rice alter cognitive perceptions of rice, and subsequently how they prepare and consume their fermented rice. This will provide evidence how the disappearance of many traditional rice varieties and the material properties of rice influence human interaction with their food environments, and how this erodes and/or promotes cultural food knowledge. This will inform programmatic efforts on crop improvement, sustainable diet promotion and biocultural diversity conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Although the low-lying region has a long history of flooding, this rapid increase has sparked a crisis discourse, leading the city government to name flooding ""the #1 priority"" and begin swift actions to preserve the local environs. This project, which trains a doctoral student in methods of rigorous and empirically-grounded data collection and analysis, examines the creation and maintenance of Charleston's storm drainage systems, seawalls, and networks of rice dikes and floodgates to map and analyze the preservation of heritage sites. Project findings will be disseminated in such a way that aids planners explore more equitable ways to define risk, resistance, and resilience in regards to specific community needs and desires. Finally, this research project aims to produce work that will be helpful to local communities fighting the impacts of flooding in Charleston, South Carolina.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brian Walter, under the supervision of Dr. Melissa Caldwell of the University of California at Santa Cruz will investigate the relationship between flood water and heritage discourses and practices by conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the Charleston Lowcountry. During this period, he will work across stratified locations suffering the effects of sea-level-rise. At these sites, the researcher will use interviews, participant observation, and participatory GIS to gain knowledge about how individuals differentially define heritage in the environment, experience sea-level rise and fight for the maintenance of flood infrastructure. This work aims to contribute to debates about environmental change mitigation, by offering an ethnographic case to better explain how sea-level-rise is experienced socioeconomically: an essential complement to quantitative data models that focus on macro-level change and assume an equal amount of flooding causes equal damage to life. This outcome will help make the intersection between race and the environment visible in policy conversations and help promote methodologies to determine alternative definitions of normed policy concepts such as value, vulnerability, or heritage site employed in current spatial studies determining the impacts of sea-level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Over time, the pronunciation of a language changes, but its orthography remains fixed. This poses problems for standardized spelling, language teaching and learning, and even speech recognition technologies, which need to process and convert spoken language into orthographic representations and vice versa. This dissertation addresses the problem of pronunciation change over time, looking specifically at cases where a distinction between two sounds that was previously present and represented orthographically begins to be lost. Changes like this happen gradually, where differences in the acoustics (""acoustic cues"") slowly disappear, sometimes without speakers even realizing it. For example, ""t"" and ""d"" are different sounds in Dutch, but over time, the difference between ""t"" and ""d"" was lost at the ends of words; ""bot"" (bone) and ""bod"" (offer) are both pronounced like the English word ""bought"". This type of sound change, called ""neutralization"", is not always complete; small but measurable acoustic differences may remain between the two sounds, despite sounding identical to the naked ear. Studies have shown that listeners are able to perceive these differences subconsciously, as they can tell two seemingly-identical words apart (e.g. Dutch ""bot"" and ""bod"") at a rate better than chance, even without additional context. It is unknown what causes this incompleteness, how this process unfolds over time, and what social characteristics affect it. Additionally, it is unclear how speakers can tell these sounds apart, and what the necessary acoustics are for distinguishing between them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation will examine two cases of apparently incomplete neutralization in Dutch and Afrikaans. Both languages are losing the distinction between ""t"" and ""d"" and between ""p"" and ""b"", both word-initially and word-finally, though they are at different stages of the neutralization process. In four experiments, participants will read words and stories that have these consonants, and then listen to the sounds with manipulated acoustics and see if they can tell them apart. As we discover what differences listeners can hear, we are able to understand more about our cognitive capabilities and how social characteristics can affect our speech and hearing. This knowledge can be used to inform speech recognition technologies to better understand variability in speech production. Additionally, we will have a better understanding of language pronunciation change over time, which can help us develop curricula for teaching foreign languages, especially focusing on the link between reading and pronunciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In particular, the pain of Black patients is consistently under-diagnosed and under-treated.  Black Americans are less likely to be prescribed pain medication.  When they do receive pain medication, they are prescribed lower doses on average. Beyond the threat this inequality in pain care presents to the health and well-being of minority individuals, unequal treatment of pain has consequences for national productivity. As one example, untreated or mistreated pain is associated with difficulty in returning to work following injury. Theory and research in social psychology has identified several factors that contribute to racial bias in pain care, including stereotypes, implicit racial bias, and gaps in empathy. This project expands on past research by including a separate and distinct perceptual basis for this bias in pain care.  The central premise is that race shapes the visual perception of painful expressions on others' faces, triggering a cascade of biased processing and behavioral outcomes.  By bringing together theory and research in social psychology, vision science, cognitive neuroscience, and health care, this project seeks to develop a social perceptual model of racial bias in pain care. It will reveal the psychological and perceptual mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in pain treatment and help to develop potential interventions to reduce the bias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is organized around a set of eight behavioral and neuroimaging experiments that examine the psychological roots, neural bases, and behavioral consequences of racial bias in pain perception. The studies consider whether race influences the recognition and treatment of pain by disrupting the visual perception of painful facial expressions.  One expected effect is that perceivers see painful expressions on Black faces earlier than they do on White faces, and that this difference can account for some of the known biases in treatment, over and above the influence of explicit stereotypes or implicit racial bias. The research aims to uncover aspects of the perceiver and of the person being perceived that make the bias larger or smaller, focusing on factors such as social status, racial prototypicality, and interracial contact.  The project also considers whether medical health professionals show the same perceptual bias, and whether the bias is observed when self-report information about pain experience is available.  As a potential focus for intervention, the research tests whether brain and behavioral responses associated with visual biases in pain care are reduced by increased familiarity of and experience with Black faces.  The existence of racial disparities in pain care undermines public health and threatens national productivity.  This project contributes to a foundation of basic knowledge on which future interventions can be based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, urbanization is experienced differently across regions. The varying roles played by the government, local communities, and ordinary citizens are at the root of the diverse urbanization processes across the world. While the government can directly shape the outcome of urbanization through its laws, policies, and regulations, the roles played by local communities and ordinary citizens may be less visible and therefore overlooked. Nevertheless, the various types of grassroots activities can fundamentally affect the outcomes of urbanization (such as the spatial distribution of social resources, the redefinition of urban citizenship, and the reconstruction of property rights). Understanding how local communities and ordinary citizens experience and respond to the urbanization process in different social and cultural contexts can facilitate the development of programs and policies that are appropriate to specific communities or social groups. Such knowledge is especially important to developing countries where urbanization often resulted in uneven distribution of resources and unequal opportunities among social groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Yi Wu of Clemson University will examine the social, political, and technological challenges associated with creating an equal and inclusive society in the midst of a rapid urbanization process. Because of it is urbanizing faster than most other regions, China is an appropriate context for exploring these questions. For example, 13% of China's population lived in cities in the 1950s, while the number reached 53.7% in 2013. Moreover, such rapid urbanization was accompanied by significant political changes, diverse social conflicts, and popular resistance. Conducted by Dr. Yi Wu (Clemson University), this research studies rural communities on China's urban fringes. Specifically, it examines whether and how village communities and rural individuals have defended and redefined their land rights within the context of rapid urbanization in the new-millennium China.  Empirical data will be collected from three villages in China that have been experiencing urbanization at different rates and in different environments. Through participant observation, interviewing, and documentary research, Dr. Yi Wu collect data on (1) land loss caused by urban expansion in these communities, (2) each village's land development plans and strategies, and (3) the rights-asserting activities of rural individuals. Data from these villages will allow a comparison of land use patterns associated with different stages of urbanization, as well as a comparison of the varied perceptions of rural populations on issues of rights, equality, and social justice. Furthermore, data on how rural communities and individuals engage in land bargains may help social scientists and policy makers assess whether and how hybrid and contested property regimes can be conducive to economic development. In short, the questions addressed by this research concern not just China, but other parts of the world, especially developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

To address the low numbers of women in politics, numerous countries have adopted gender quotas in political representation. The gender quotas include methods such as requiring political parties to field female candidates during elections or to nominate them directly into political office. Although much research has been conducted to investigate which gender quotas work best to increase the number of women in political office, we still do not fully understand how these women experience the gender quota system. This research will be carried out in Kenya, where a 2010 constitution introduced gender quotas to increase women's political representation. Kenya's gender quota directs that women should occupy at least one-third of the seats in the 47 county assemblies. The gender quota has been implemented in two election cycles since 2010. When few women won seats by election, political parties nominated hundreds of women to county assemblies to meet the gender quota. However, these women have been criticized as allies of political parties that are dominated by men. Through observational methods, interviews, and document and media analyses, the researcher will investigate the experiences of female members of county assembly in Murang'a and Kwale counties in Kenya. These two counties have different ethnic groups, religions, and political histories.

While endangered, Chanka continues to be a vital code for many speakers, thus allowing documentation of the language in actual use. This project will develop a transcribed corpus of approximately 64 hours of sociolinguistic interviews with speakers in four communities, selected as proxies for differences in Spanish fluency, ruralness, and education. Traditional variationist qualitative methods, often involving reading tasks, are adapted as audiovisual activities to determine how non-literate speakers evaluate different ways of speaking.

The project will enhance understanding of speech production and perception, particularly regarding how acoustic features are distributed throughout the words of a language to minimize misperceptions and therefore facilitate reliable communication. More broadly, this work is relevant for research on the relation between speech sounds and word knowledge in both adults and children, contributing to the identification of unique distinctions between languages that affect second language learners, and ultimately informing models focusing on various types of hearing impairment in everyday communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two general models of the structure of the sound system of a language are contrasted. The first model, referred to as the ""inventory model"", is the canonical approach that forms the basis for most phonetic descriptions of sound systems in speech perception. Under the inventory model, the sound system is structured as a fixed set of contrastive consonants and vowels, where this set is treated as homogeneous in weight such that all elements play an equal role in defining the system and determining the relative importance of individual acoustic cues. The second model, referred to as the lexicon model, considers the system of contrastive sounds to be critically distributed over the lexicon, such that the relative weight of different cues now depends on the number and configuration of words those cues serve to distinguish. In contrasting these two approaches, two main questions are asked: (1) how well do the models agree in their estimates of cue weights, and what accounts for points of agreement and disagreement; and (2) what does each model entail for the stability of the system in the presence of background noise in the environment. The inventory model uses a database of controlled productions of syllables to predict prior-published confusion patterns between sounds, with cue weights then measured as the relative importance of each cue in the model predicting listener perception patterns. For the lexicon model, a database of nearly 27,000 words produced by a single speaker is used to predict listener word recognition patterns when these words are embedded in noise in a series of six experiments utilizing different tasks (open, fill-in-the-blank recognition, and closed choice between two similar-sounding words) and different stimuli (naturally produced, enhanced, and degraded). The cue weights from these two model fits are then compared to address the first question. To answer the second question, simulations of noise added to different cues, and the resulting change in predicted similarity between sounds (in the inventory case) and words (in the lexicon case), are used to study the stability and adaptive response of each system to uncertainty in the acoustic signal. As such, these experiments will be able to address key claims about the structure and organization of sound systems in language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Having possession of a land base is essential in order to generate revenues and prevent their own displacement, particularly for economically disadvantaged and minority communities. Legal titling and registration of those lands is often considered to be a critical method for ensuring a land base, yet titling does not always translate into real possession of those lands. Government policies, private sector forces, and natural disasters, may gradually erode of a land base as they legally or economically compel community members to sell or vacate their titled lands. Without the ability to decide who can use the lands, manage the purposes for which they are used, and enforce those policies, such communities have little security over their land bases. This project, which supports the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, explores how such communities establish authority over land in order to prevent their displacement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation research centers the experiences of nine Indigenous Rama and Afrodescendant Kriol communities in southeastern Nicaragua that received a communal title to a territory that is four-fifths the size of Delaware in 2009. This site is particularly appropriate for this project due to the recency of the issuing of a title and the researcher's engagement with these communities during a majority of the period since the title was issued, providing for an analysis of the changing conditions of territorial control since that time. While Nicaraguan law guarantees that communal lands under the title may not be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise alienated except in extremely limited circumstances and after consultation with the communities, the Rama-Kriol Territory is being impacted by mestizo settlers from the interior of the country, who are seizing growing segments of the territory for crops and ranching. This has destroyed Rama-Kriol agricultural areas and hunting grounds, contaminated rivers, and wholly displaced one Rama community. The investigation will focus on how the Rama-Kriol Territorial Government and its constituent communities are seeking to effectively use their territory through three key areas: the management of the physical occupancy of the territory; the gathering and management of information about the occupancy of the territory; and the contestation of the capacity of different levels of government to decide on the management of the territory. To do so, the researcher will interview community members, Rama and Kriol forest rangers, communal and territorial leaders, government officials, and mestizo settlers in the territory and carry out participant-observation in the daily activities of land governance in the Rama-Kriol Territory. This will allow for a fine-grained understanding of ways in which people experience and participate in these processes. Archival research at the Nicaraguan national archives will also add historical depth to this study of the processes of colonization and dispossession under way in the Rama-Kriol Territory.

In post-meltdown Japan, the effort at constructing normal life continues to raise questions about how, and in what terms, this may be possible when the effects of radioactivity from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster remain uncertain. Despite concerns for health amidst an administratively raised level of permissible airborne radiation (which is necessary for re-building the region), many families have remained in, or returned to, their less-than-ideal neighborhoods in Fukushima Prefecture for various reasons like the presence of jobs, aging parents, and family farms. The research on such families in this area and their efforts at maintaining (or restoring) children's health will provide a microcosm for examining the dynamics through which futures are being made in a context with increasing environmental uncertainty. The researcher has chosen to focus on those families in cities across Fukushima Prefecture, where the populations were not evacuated and have chosen to remain, or return, to make lives within a raised level of airborne radiation with little official assistance. Although children's health has become a problem for parents, post-nuclear politics, and future imaginaries in post-Fukushima Japan, research on child-raising practices by ordinary families who are actually striving to survive in this area is almost totally lacking. In employing a combination of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis, the researcher will collect sets of data on the strategies of living with radiation adopted by parents who knowingly bring up children in irradiated neighborhoods in Fukushima, the public debates surrounding radioactive uncertainty with regard to victimhood and entitlement in post-nuclear care, and forms of sociality that take shape through anxious care-giving in the post-disaster support networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

People carry with them an enduring sense of what is true or false, and whether or not things exist in the world.  Beliefs are central to what it means to be human.  The nature of human beliefs -- their structure, function, and change -- has been the subject of study across many fields of science over many decades.  Past theories and research have approached the subject in two distinct ways.  One, most common in the behavioral and cognitive sciences, is to understand how a single person's network of beliefs relate to one another.  Another, most common in the social and economic sciences, is to understand how one person's beliefs are related to the beliefs of other people in one's social network.  All of these efforts to understand the nature of beliefs are motivated by important broader impacts.  For example, public health campaigns aim to change beliefs, and ultimately behaviors, in service of the health and welfare of society.  The aim of this project is to develop a new theoretical framework that integrates understanding of belief networks at both the individual and social levels.  One expected outcome is a better understanding of why some beliefs are resistant to change while others are not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project adopts a network perspective to study why some beliefs are more resistant to change than others. Drawing from psychology, sociology, economics, computer science, and statistical physics, a unifying theoretical framework is developed.  The premise of the model is that network dynamics of beliefs follow similar principles at the individual and at the social level --  that people are motivated to reduce dissonance (energy) both in their own belief network and in their social networks.  The model provides novel predictions about how networks of beliefs on individual and social levels jointly affect belief's resistance to change. The model is tested in a longitudinal survey conducted in four waves, allowing an assessment of belief dynamics over time. An experimental manipulation is introduced before the third wave, allowing for the assessment of potential interventions.  The data analyses rely on advanced statistical models including statistical physics modeling, network modeling, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling.  The project will advance basic knowledge by integrating previously disconnected literatures on individual and social beliefs in a single theoretical framework, and developing and testing qualitative and quantitative predictions about the joint effects of individual and social network structures on belief change over time.  The research will contribute to a foundation of knowledge that informs the design of educational interventions aimed at increasing scientific knowledge in the general population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Anywhere from 20 to 60 percent of school-aged youth report that they have experienced bullying, of whom 10-15 percent may be chronic victims. Bullying appears to peak during the middle school years, a time when youth are particularly concerned about status and fitting in. Victims tend to have low self-esteem and feel more lonely, anxious, and depressed than their non-victimized peers. These negative consequences partly explain why victims can also struggle academically. Most school interventions target all students in the school and are guided by the belief that reducing bullying is everyone's responsibility. Those universal interventions often lose sight of the most vulnerable youth who may have a history of being bullied and are already experiencing one or more painful outcomes. This research tests the effects of attribution processes, social networks, and group norms in an integrated model (""Powering Up"") of bullying. The attribution processes often lead to a pattern of self-blame (""why me?"") that can have long-term negative effects. The research further tests how to utilize social network patterns and group norms to reduce bullying behaviors. This research will facilitate our understanding of the social psychological processes involved in bullying and provide novel insight into middle school group dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the integrated effects of attributional processes, social network processes, and group norms on bullying during middle school. These social influence processes are integrated in ""Powering Up"", a program that focuses on victims during the middle school years. Powering Up utilizes three social influence mechanisms to combat peer victimization: (1) Why Power is a 12-lesson curriculum designed to alter the maladaptive attributions of at-risk victims; (2) Friend Power uses experimental techniques to build friendships between victims and influential peers in their grade; and (3) Peer Power utilizes leadership models to change peer norms about the acceptability of bullying. This multi-component program will be implemented in urban (California) and rural (Missouri) communities with 6th grade students in schools that vary in ethnic diversity. Powering Up will test these intervention strategies and focus on attributional change, building new friendships between bullying victims and influential peers, and spreading of anti-bullying norms throughout the peer networks. This research will advance basic social psychological knowledge on peer influence processes and the power of attributions to change behavior. The project will also provide new insights into individual, social, and contextual factors that promote resilience and academic achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In the American Southwest, for example, droughts and floods can threaten cattle ranchers. In response, ranchers have developed a social institution, called ""neighboring,"" in which ranchers help neighbors in need. What would happen to institutions like neighboring, however, when the economy changes quickly? Around the world, herding can be a high-risk livelihood, with herd sizes routinely prone to sudden fluctuations due to drought, disease, and, in some countries, raids. Herders routinely have similar stock friendships, or networks of cattle lending and sharing. Some researchers suggest that stock friendships might be an example of informal insurance systems to protect against cattle losses, whereas others claim that they might be useful for accumulating cattle wealth and political influence among households over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aaron Lightner, under the supervision of Dr. Edward Hagen of Washington State University, investigates Maasai pastoralists in Tanzania, who have made their living by herding cattle for centuries. Recently, however, population growth, drought, and urbanization have forced many Maasai herders to turn to agriculture and cash economies, becoming less dependent on the high-risk business of herding cattle, a sudden, fundamental change to their local economy. This research will investigate how stock friendship institutions have adapted to the changing economy, collecting data on household-level income from cattle, agriculture, and other sources; partner preferences and reputations; past activity among stock friends; and social networks among stock friends. Social network analysis will help the researchers test existing ideas about how and why people are participating in stock friendships, and to understand how these reasons might vary among people who are highly impacted vs. less impacted by economic and environmental changes at the field site. This research provides a unique opportunity to investigate not only how stock friendships buffer economic risks, but also how stock friendships are adapting to changes that are affecting herders around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This research will answer two related questions about sign language verbs. Specifically, we ask when and why signers use one verb (e.g., [she-puts-planes-in-a-row]) vs. two verbs (e.g., [she-puts] [planes-in-a-row]) to describe a particular event.  This structure is commonly studied in spoken languages, sometimes expressed as serial verb constructions, but it has not been studied in sign languages. Project researchers will examine how signers produce this structure and also how they understand it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a series of studies, researchers will investigate whether certain language-specific differences about two-verb predicates in sign languages are attributable to typological class (rather than to random variation or historical relatedness).  Data from three well-established, national sign languages that are unrelated to one another will be studied: American Sign Language, Hong Kong Sign Language, and Turkish Sign Language. Typology has been an important tool in predicting variation among spoken languages, and it is hypothesized to have the same explanatory power in signed languages.  Project investigators will also examine how two-verb predicates emerge in sign languages and what factors are the first to trigger two-verb predicates in historical time. To address these issues, the research team will analyze data from homesigners (individuals who have not acquired a conventional language but develop their own gestural communication systems) and signers from Nicaragua. Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) is an emerging sign language that is roughly 40 years old. The results of these analyses will shed light on the ""nature"" vs. ""nurture"" question, since the specific factors that trigger two-verb predicates in homesigners (phonological, morphological, semantic) are more likely to be ubiquitous in human language, both spoken and signed. Although it is no longer possible to trace spoken languages back to their roots in this way, the emergence of sign language in homesign provides a window onto language creation, more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Understanding the structure and organization of the human lexicon is critical to both linguistic and psycholinguistic theories of language. However, current theories are predominantly built upon evidence from spoken languages, and may underrepresent characteristics that are particularly common to sign languages. For example, a core assumption regarding the organization of the lexicon is that there is a sharp separation between semantic structure and phonological (form) structure--the way words are pronounced is generally thought to be unrelated to what they mean. However, mounting evidence suggests that iconicity, words or signs that resemble their meaning, is pervasive in both signed and spoken languages. Examples of iconicity in English are words like ""ping"" and ""sizzle"" that sound like what they mean; examples of iconicity in ASL are signs like DRINK and HAMMER which look like what they mean. While semantic and phonological structure might not be fully independent from each other in ASL, we know relatively little about how they relate to one another and whether or how iconicity may shape the lexicon. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project represents the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of the semantic organization of the ASL lexicon. The project will collect valuable information about the semantic similarity of ASL signs and the size of semantic neighborhoods, which will be key to uncovering how knowledge about sign meaning is stored and organized, as well as how this structure is acquired. Specifically, this project aims to 1) conduct a lexicon-wide evaluation of the semantic associations between signs, 2) characterize iconic and non-iconic systematic relationships between form and meaning using visualization techniques inspired by network science, and 3) implement a novel approach to quantify iconicity in a subset of the lexicon in an effort to understand which semantic features participate in iconic mappings and how iconicity might shape semantic processing. The data collected under this project will be integrated into a large interactive lexical database of the semantic, phonological, and iconic structure that is publicly available (ASL-LEX: http://asl-lex.org/). These materials constitute essential tools that will allow scientists and educators to create well-controlled stimuli for use in research and the classroom. Finally, it is important to recognize that deaf people often have difficulty pursuing research careers because of communication roadblocks that hamper interaction with hearing scientists. The researchers on this project have ""deaf-friendly labs"" (e.g., project staff are fluent in ASL) and provide training that facilitates the entrance of deaf students into scientific and academic fields.

Despite the centrality of fieldwork to the discipline of cultural anthropology, the conduits through which its findings are communicated do not always reach a larger audience.

This film will educate general audiences and students alike about what cultural anthropologists actually do today. The film promises to be a valuable resource for anthropology students and for scholars in other disciplines interested in contemporary anthropological research.

In particular, it will explore new forms of political belonging and governance that exceed national borders, asking what can be learned from supra-national regional dynamics, processes, and imaginations that are becoming increasingly significant in contemporary global politics. In an era when regional alliances and strategies, from the European Union to the North American Free Trade Agreement, are increasingly the subject of intense debate, the significance of region-building more broadly will enhance our understanding of the comparative geopolitics of regional bodies and their role in conflict prevention and resolution.

Working with populations who have endured high-stress environments, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with women when they are pregnant and subsequently measure markers of stress in those women and their infants, to understand how trauma affects women and children socially, emotionally, and biologically. Through these bio-ethnographic methods, the project will advance our understanding of epigenetic responses to the environment in humans. The project will also contribute to graduate training and mentoring and may inform public health research and behavioral health interventions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project considers how biosocial inheritance, or the means by which social adversity or advantage is transmitted across generations, may play a role in intergenerational trauma. Specifically, this project considers (1) how women enduring adverse environments subjectively construct their traumatic experience; (2) whether maternal trauma may be ""molecularized"" at the level of the epigenome; (3) whether maternal traumatic experience is associated with neuroendocrine stress during pregnancy; and (4) whether maternal epigenetic or neuroendocrine signals correspond to those seen in offspring in early life. In this study of 112 mother-infant dyads, mothers' subjective appraisals of trauma will be elicited through semi-structured and life history interviews, which will be used to contextualize their responses to a survey of traumatic exposure and a trauma symptoms checklist. Their biological incorporation of trauma will be assessed with measures of DNA methylation and hair cortisol concentration. Methylation will be measured at five genes that are involved in the neuroendocrine stress response: NR3C1, FKBP5, BDNF, SLC6A4, and MAOA. To evaluate for broader patterns of epigenetic modification, epigenome-wide methylation analyses will also be conducted. To investigate the potential for intergenerational programming, this project will measure chronic cortisol secretion in mothers, cortisol reactivity following a modest stressor in infants at eight weeks of age, and DNA methylation at these five stress-related loci in both mothers and infants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Numerous mathematical results seem to suggest that acquiring a language should be impossible; the fact that children do it every day reveals a deep gap in the science of learning. Some research suggests that children make considerable headway by detecting patterns in what they hear even without any explicit teaching or even knowing what is being talked about (""statistical"" or ""unsupervised"" learning). Indeed, much of the recent progress in ""teaching"" computers to understand language has made use of just this strategy. Even more compelling: numerous experiments have shown that both adults and infants are able to learn at least a little bit about language this way. How much they can learn remains unclear.  A central difficulty is that mathematically, there are many different methods for pattern-detection and it is unclear which one(s) humans use. This is important because some work better than others; and whether unsupervised pattern-detection can help solve the mystery of language learning depends on which method is used. The purpose of this project is to put together a ""challenge suite"": a dataset that can be used to systematically evaluate and compare the possibilities. Such challenge suites have been instrumental in advancing artificial intelligence. This project also serves as a proof-of-concept to determine whether challenge suites are similarly beneficial for the science of learning, and at the same time provide valuable resources and training to the research community. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To develop the challenge suite, the investigators will first conduct a comprehensive, quantitative literature review (meta-analysis) focusing on the largest body of work on unsupervised pattern-detection: adult statistical word segmentation. Aided by outside experimenters,   the meta-analysis  will be used to identify 10-15 key experiments. As a group, these experiments will establish a basic set of facts about adult statistical word segmentation that any theory must account for. For these reasons, the project will focus particularly on theoretically-central phenomena that distinguish different theories.  To measure different aspects of linguistic pattern-detection, each experiment will involve large numbers of subjects (approx. 1,200 each) and a subset of 3-5 experiments with an even larger number (approx. 24,000 each). A tool will be developed to enable researchers to compare any mathematical theory of learning against these data, determining how well it matches human performance. In order to determine how the mathematical theory could learn language,  a database of transcripts of child-directed speech in 3-5 languages will be developed. Each theory will also be tested/trained on the database to see how much it could learn about those languages.  The challenge suite will be made available to all researchers as a download and  also through a website where researchers can submit their models and compare results against those of other models.

Early-life stress can lead to modifications to the structure of DNA, which changes the way genes are expressed, potentially leading to negative effects on health and well-being. There are hints in human studies that stress and trauma in children are associated with language impairments and achievement gaps in school. However, a major question remains unresolved: how does developmental stress affect the learning process, and what changes in the brain underlie these effects? Further, emerging evidence suggests that bacteria in the gut have major effects on multiple axes of health, including mental and behavioral health. Antibiotics are routinely used in medicine, especially during childhood, but often have the side effect of disrupting the ""good"" bacteria in the gut. This project aims to understand 1) whether stress causes lasting changes to learning-related gene expression in the brain and 2) whether disruptions to gut bacterial communities can induce stress and impair learning. Understanding how to prevent and mediate these effects of early-life stress is critical to fostering lifelong educational achievement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Songbirds and humans share the unique ability to learn vocalizations, as well as certain genes and neural structures associated with vocal learning and brain development. In addition, song is a robust, quantifiable measure of learning, and songbirds exhibit impaired song-learning ability after early-life stress. This project will examine the effects of developmental stress on learning, the brain, and the microbiome, using the zebra finch as a songbird model system. Zebra finch nestlings will be differentially treated either with orally administered corticosterone, to mimic the hormonal and physiological effects of chronic stress, or with a vector control. The investigator will also administer antibiotics to a subset of birds to test whether perturbations to the microbiome can induce a stress response that affects learning. After the treatment phase, juvenile zebra finches will be placed with an adult male zebra finch tutor. The investigator will continuously record all sounds produced by the juvenile for the 60-day duration of the song-learning period to quantify and compare the rate and accuracy of song learning across treatments. The investigator will then collect neural tissue from regions of the brain known to be involved in song learning, as well as regions unrelated to song development, to assess gene expression across brain nuclei and treatments with RNAseq. Fecal samples will be collected at regular time points for 16S sequencing to analyze microbial composition. Taken together, these experiments on the effects of early-life stress in songbirds will shed light on the underlying connections between stress, the microbiome, and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Researchers aim to understand the complex evolutionary processes through which societies and individuals interacted with ancient drugs including tobacco, cannabis, caffeinated teas, coffee, chocolate, and opiates. Few adults today have not used or been impacted by one or more of these intoxicants, many of which have in recent times been refined into incredibly potent and addictive substances, with global health consequences. Archaeology offers a deep-time perspective into plant domestication, coupled human-plant interactions, and addiction and drug use by people, who used an array of plants not only as food but also for social, ceremonial, recreational, and medicinal reasons. Chemical residue analysis of alkaloid biomarkers in ancient materials offers a novel means of approaching these issues; recent studies have produced compelling results demonstrating the global scale and deep time use of intoxicant plants.

Analytical methods include liquid and gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS and GC-TOFMS), Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and metabolomics research tools to chemically fingerprint key drug plants and test assumptions concerning their use in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WSU team focuses on two exciting research avenues: (1) ancient metabolomics, which employs powerful metabolomic profiling tools to evaluate the complete chemical fingerprint of plants and ancient residues, with the goal of discriminating plants to the species level, and (2) dental calculus studies, directed at refining identification of intoxicant compounds in human dental calculus (mineralized plaque), which permits identification of drug use of substances including tobacco, cannabis, and opioids to the individual level. Improved dental calculus methods will provide researchers the capability to ask anthropologically significant questions about intoxicant use by individuals of varied circumstances and societal groups (e.g., use patterns by age, gender, status, health categories) and previously ""invisible"" users (i.e., those not buried with artifacts indicating use such as pipes), as well as effects on oral health, past and present.

In contrast, modern artificial intelligence systems like Siri and Alexa need to be trained extensively on massive data sets; even then the linguistic abilities of such systems lag far behind those of a child. Scientific research on language acquisition and structure has taught us that children come to the task of language learning with preconceptions of what their language will look like. They use such preconceptions, referred to as ""biases"", to guide their learning, favoring language structures that are compatible with those biases. By structuring computers systems to incorporate these biases, we could construct computer interfaces that would be more effective not only for languages such as English and Spanish, but also for the many languages where training data is scarce, spoken in smaller communities within the United States and internationally. Moreover, understanding more about how the biases necessary for language learning can be instantiated in a computer model will help to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of these human biases: are they specific to language or are they the result of more general properties of human cognition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project explores the learning of regularities in natural language syntax by computer systems. The focus will be specifically on systems based on neural networks, which have been behind the recent revolutionary advances in language technologies. The project will study a wide range of neural network architectures, some with explicitly represented linguistic biases and some not, and compare them with respect to their abilities to learn carefully defined linguistic patterns. In contrast to past work that has evaluated linguistic knowledge of neural networks indirectly through a language modeling (word prediction) task, this project instead explores tasks that are formulated as transformations, which map one linguistic form to another (e.g., question formation, verbal inflection, negation, passivization, mapping to logical form). Not only are such mappings at the basis of a widely applied class of neural network architectures, so-called sequence to sequence networks, but they are also a common way of characterizing syntactic processes in linguistics. As a result, the use of such mappings allows a more direct assessment of the networks' linguistic abilities. Part of the project will involve the collaborative development of training and testing datasets for the mappings, with involvement by an interdisciplinary team of linguists and computer scientists, and these will be made available as a resource for the entire research community.

The aim of this doctoral research project is to functionally describe the anatomy of the primate neck to understand how differences in the neck are related to head posture, body posture, and locomotion in primates. The project will provide data that may be used for inferring when a human-like neck first appeared and how this anatomical change was associated with environmental, behavioral and biological factors. This study will employ a combination of 3D anatomical methods including CT scanning, digital muscle fascicle tracking, and biomechanical modeling, which will serve as training tools for future researchers and health care professionals. The 3D models generated in this study will be used in K-12 science education and outreach events for discussing human anatomy and primate conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this study is to both characterize and quantify neck muscle anatomy in primates with different habitual body postures and locomotor behaviors. Using a biomechanical framework, the project will compare functional differences in neck musculature that are key for behaviors such as holding up the head and movement of the arms during suspension. Novel techniques including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, muscle fascicle tracking software, and 3D lever mechanics will be used to develop biomechanical models of how variation in muscle size, shape, and distribution is related to postural and locomotor behavior across primates. These biomechanical models will be applied to fossil hominins (Australopithecus sediba and Homo neanderthalensis) to interpret their neck anatomy and posture to more accurately understand and reconstruct their behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate population health and social inequalities that contributed to the 1918 pandemic outcomes, taking into account both influenza and other respiratory illnesses that were circulating during the pandemic. Advancing knowledge about how past behaviors and population structure affected previous pandemic outcomes can contribute to contemporary knowledge of human behaviors, population structure, and potential infectious threats. This project will also support science outreach and education activities at the research location and home institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will analyze the impact of population heterogeneity, specifically in terms of social inequalities, on mortality associated with four respiratory diseases (influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and bronchitis) during the 1918 influenza pandemic on the island of Newfoundland. Newfoundland represents a unique opportunity for the use of historical archival data to reconstruct the political economy, population, and social structure of a pre-industrial society in a way that is directly comparable to its Western neighbors. Early 20th century Newfoundland's urban and rural regions varied greatly in their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; therefore, research questions will address how age, sex, gendered divisions of labor, crowding, income, and education facilitate social inequality that leads to differential disease mortality. The data used will be collected from the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, and will include yearly vital statistics, death records, newspapers, diaries, photograph collections, and literature. Survival analysis and seasonal regression models will be used to quantify differential mortality across the island, but qualitative data are also critical to understanding the cultural norms of men, women, and children during the early 20th century, and an anthropological perspective on 1918 pandemic mortality.

The project is built upon the interdisciplinary team of one visual cognition researcher and six decision science researchers at Drake University (Des Moines, Iowa).  By integrating the well-established techniques in the visual cognition field, the system enables decision science researchers in the team (economics, marketing, accounting, actuarial science, information management) to examine cognitive mechanisms involved in decision-making processes with a finer resolution than eye-tracking methods typically employed in the fields of decision science research.  The system allows researchers to investigate information-processing mechanisms that operate prior to conscious response. The project is designed not only to make real-world application of visual cognition research more accessible to students, but also to introduce students in the decision science field to a scientific approach of dealing with novel data acquired through systematic empirical investigations.  Because decision science is uniquely concerned with how individuals make optimal choices based on available information, some decision scientists work exclusively with pre-existing data.  The research team also recognizes that popular methods of recruiting students to the research lab through a single department has its limitation to reach out to underrepresented student populations.  To promote diversity, equity and inclusion, multiple mechanisms to recruit and support a wide range of students are built in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions pursued in the present project range across (1) how much attentional control one can exert during memory maintenance (visual cognition), (2) how different ways of presenting the nutrition information shapes one's decision-making process of food choice (marketing), (3) how the lack of opportunities affects one's cognitive mechanisms differently from resource scarcity (economics: psychology of poverty), (4) how a popular survey method (i.e., the choice experiment) can be optimized with powerful perceptual and cognitive manipulations (environmental economics), (5) how visual features of the voluntarily disclosed financial information can minimize the chance that the investors can be misled (accounting), (6) when individuals tend to stop processing the massive amount of disclosure information, and how visualization of the difficult-to-understand section would ease one's comprehension of the product (actuarial science), and (7) how search efficiency of the crucial information can be enhanced in the e-commerce context (information management).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Scientists debate competing evolutionary explanations for these divergences, and a promising theoretical avenue emphasizes links between these traits and human life history traits: long juvenile periods and lifespans, cooperative childcare, and large relative brain size.  In this project, researchers will study age-related changes in how a non-human primate species (capuchins) invents new behaviors and acquires behaviors from others in the wild. Because capuchins have independently evolved a less extreme version of the human life history pattern (e.g., slow development, long lifespans, large brains for body size, and prolonged co-residence with a variety of caregiving relatives), they can generate insights into the role of life history traits in promoting particular types of social learning. This research project will also include a number of training and science education activities. The research team will provide fieldwork opportunities and mentoring, and consequently enhanced prospects for admission to graduate school, to approximately 12 young scientists; involve high school students in data analysis; and make presentations about scientific methods and tropical forest conservation to schools near the research site. Researchers will also collaborate with videographers and with local environmental educators to produce materials to inspire students to study, appreciate, and conserve the highly endangered tropical dry forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans uniquely exhibit cumulative cultural evolution proposed to stem from factors including long juvenile periods that enable learning, intergenerational transmission of knowledge, cooperate care of offspring that further facilitates learning, and theory of mind. Theoretical models, and empirical work in developmental psychology, suggest that the tradeoff between trial-and-error learning and social learning, as well as the tradeoff between creativity and sticking to tried-and-true solutions, shift over the life course. However, in order to test theoretical models used to explain these findings in humans, researchers need non-human primate comparative data about the emergence and spread of new behavioral variants and the effects of population age structure on the social transmission of new ideas. Data will be collected in the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project, now in its 30th consecutive year. Data on genetic kinship, including grandparent-grandoffspring relationships, are available for ten social groups. Focal animal behavioral sampling will focus on the oldest and youngest animals and will include (besides routine recording of social interactions and object handling) gaze monitoring, infant-alloparent communication, and instances of joint attention to objects.

It has recently reemerged as an urgent worldwide health crisis. The origin of the disease has been a mystery since its sudden appearance in Europe at the end of the 15th century and its subsequent rapid global spread. It has long been debated whether syphilis was introduced to Europe, perhaps from the Americas, or evolved from a form of treponemal infection that had been in Europe all along.  Graduate student Ziyu Wang and collaborators at The Pennsylvania State University will take a multi-faceted approach to investigate the pathogen's genetic diversity over the past 500 years in Europe to explore several possibilities to explain syphilis' origin in Europe. The current T. pallidum pathogens - associated with several related diseases - likely represent only the most successful or recently emerged genetic variants. Examined through an anthropological lens, ancient genomes when considered within the context of human sociocultural systems yield clues about the processes through which pathogens have achieved their evolutionary success. Ultimately a more informed understanding of the factors that contribute to the complex and dynamic interactions between humans and their pathogens provides a deep-time foundation for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of modern infectious pathogens and human responses. Today, as in the past, STI-related stigma has done much to interfere with the development and implementation of effective intervention programs. Lessons learned from historic epidemics and the public response will provide valuable tools for training healthcare professionals, STI high-risk groups, and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To untangle syphilis' origin, its evolution, and its worldwide spread, the research team will sequence T. pallidum genomes from representative specimens sampled from temporally and socially well-characterized European skeletal assemblages dating to the 16th to 19th centuries. Ancient T. pallidum has previously not been well studied because of the limited ability of conventional genetic techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) to recover highly-degraded ancient pathogen DNA. Here a sensitive targeted hybridization capture technique will be used to recover complete, or near-complete, ancient T. pallidum genomes. By comparing temporally known ancient pathogen genomes with their modern equivalents, the research team can track the sequential changes that occurred in the pathogen's genetic history. Doing so will narrow the possible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of syphilis and point to when the pathogen variant that causes syphilis first emerged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The instrumentation allows developing a large set of experiments involving the acquisition of bio behavioral data crucial for understanding a number of cognitive processes connected to eye movements. At LTU, it will advance research activities and research training in several different disciplines, and will be used as a technological bridge able to link disciplines, departments, colleges, and institutions. Disciplines that will be directly supported by the instrumentation include psychology, computer science, biomedical engineering, literary studies, marketing, and architecture. The broader intellectual and societal benefits of the instrumentation acquisition include educational initiatives that advance learning experience, community engagement in metro Detroit and industry partnership. Specifically, the investigators will integrate eye-tracking methods in the development of Course-Based Research Experience (CRE) in classes within LTU, at community colleges and high schools located in socio-economic disadvantaged areas in metro Detroit.

This pivotal shift can be investigated through studies of the neck, as the human neck is adapted to balance and stabilize the head during bipedal movements. This doctoral research project will test how the shape of the bones of the neck relate to locomotion and posture in a diverse sample of mammals. The findings will be used to interpret fossilized neck bones from extinct human relatives to learn about their early forms of bipedalism, as well as potentially informing clinical research. This project will also support the sharing of three-dimensional scan data through digital repositories and the training and mentorship of student researchers, including those from groups underrepresented in scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cervical vertebrae in the hominin fossil record can provide insight into the interplay between the head, neck and trunk during key locomotor and postural transitions. Currently, however, functional interpretations of these fossils are limited to broad categories such as ""human-like"" neck mobility or ""ape-like"" neck posture. The goal of this dissertation is to improve hominin neck reconstructions by experimentally testing how cervical vertebral shape relates to neck function, locomotor mode, and trunk posture. This goal will be addressed in three objectives: 1) quantify the relationship between vertebral shape and neck mobility using bending mechanics experiments, 2) develop neck posture models in living species using virtual reconstruction methods, and 3) evaluate patterns of vertebral shape change across diverse mammalian groups using phylogenetic comparative methods. The objectives will be tested in a broad sample of primates, rodents, and marsupials. These groups contain species with independently-evolved forms of bipedal locomotion and upright trunk posture, allowing for independent verification of form-function relationships.

Nonetheless, three species of bamboo lemur focus most of their feeding time on various parts of Malagasy giant bamboo, which exposes the lemurs to 12-50 times their estimated lethal dose of cyanide on a daily basis. This project will examine the underlying physiology and genomics of cyanide detoxification in bamboo lemurs. In addition to addressing the decades-old puzzle of how these lemurs are able to consume high levels of cyanide, this study may inform the development of therapies, antidotes, or prophylactics to cyanide exposure in humans. During the course of this work, the PI and co-PI will invite and recruit undergraduates from Kent State University's McNair Scholars Program, whose mission is to help first-generation, low-income undergraduates matriculate to a doctoral degree program. The co-PI will also utilize close ties with Northeast Ohio's public libraries and schools to present this project to students and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central questions of this study focus on known routes of cyanide detoxification among mammals. Low doses of the poison can be metabolized by a variety of conserved mechanisms, foremost among which is a pathway that uses sulfurtransferase enzymes. The limiting factors for this mechanism appear to be relative expression levels for these enzymes and the availability of sulfur-donor molecules (e.g., thiosulfate). Therefore, the first working hypothesis of this study is that H. aureus has adapted to detoxify its highly cyanogenic diet through positive selection on genes involved in the metabolism of sulfur or sulfur-containing amino acids. This hypothesis will be tested by assembling and mining a reference-quality genome for H. aureus and comparing it to data taken from a proposed genome assembly for Lemur catta, the most closely related species of dietary generalist. It is further hypothesized that H. aureus detoxifies its high levels of circulating cyanide through adaptive changes to the composition of the bloodstream. This second hypothesis will be tested by transcriptomic and metabolomic methods in order to compare the expression profiles and thiosulfate levels, respectively, of free-ranging H. aureus and captive L. catta.

However, recent developments in gut microbiome research have challenged this view, with gut microbial communities shifting in response to different fat-rich diets, and the resulting gut microbiota differentially impacting energy gain. This dissertation project will examine the role of dietary fat types on energy gain from a human holobiont perspective, which interrogates both host and microbial mechanisms of energy harvest from different dietary fat sources. By assessing the impact of dietary fat type on host-microbial interactions, the investigators aim to better understand the process of dietary fat metabolism in ancestral and modern humans, to challenge traditional models of the isocaloric nature of fats, and to gain insight into associations between dietary fat intake and increasing rates of metabolic disease in industrial populations.

To address these processes, the investigators will use conventional and germ-free murine models, which are routinely used for studying the effects of microbial community shifts on human physiology.

The project will also support student training in a STEM field, and the research will be shared with local partners in education and health, as well as research and practice communities in early childhood development nationally and internationally. Resulting data will allow other researchers to validate or replicate findings in the growing research area of biological embedding and toxic stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent decades, researchers have begun to investigate mechanisms that may help to explain the greater rates of psychological distress and chronic disease seen in children within populations that have experienced extreme stress and adversity. The present research will use questionnaire, hormone, and DNA methylation data to examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma - especially those that occurred while the mother or child was in utero - impact child genetic expression and regulation of the stress response. Community-engaged research in this context provides a unique opportunity to study the transgenerational epigenetic transmission of trauma-related changes to the stress response and to learn about the risk and resilience factors that shape child development in the wake of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In addition to being snapshots of once living populations, biological anthropology collections are valuable repositories of past anthropologists' collection management strategies. The legacies and decisions, like ones made by Ales Hrdlicka at the NMNH, changed how collections of human remains were formed, accessioned, and cared for in museums. Understanding how collections were treated in the past will help museums make informed decisions about destructive sampling requests, allow researchers to optimize study design, and help to establish museum care standards with modern scientific methods (e.g. DNA sequencing) in mind. This project will contribute to STEM education by providing training opportunities for undergraduates through the Smithsonian Fellowship Program and Co-PI Austin's dissertation research. Additionally, the public will be engaged at events like the ""Expert Is In"" talk series at the NMNH, presentations at the NMNH and department presentations at the University of Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate the impact of changing collection care strategies on biological anthropology collections, this project will focus on biomolecular (DNA) preservation in dental calculus (calcified plaque). Dental calculus from anthropological collections has been used to address important questions concerning the health, diet, and population dynamics of past peoples. However, variation in dental calculus development and preservation across human populations is underexplored. By taking into consideration multiple lines of evidence (i.e. ancient DNA sequencing, skeletal and morphological data, and archival information) from temporally and geographically representative collections, this study will investigate 1) how environmental factors contribute to dental calculus formation and 2) how collection care decisions by past biological anthropologists have affected the long-term storage of collections. As a world-leading museum, the NMNH offers extraordinary collections with spatial and temporal depth to address these two objectives and will provide valuable information to other collections around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This will enhance Texas State University's research and outreach programs in forensic anthropology, biology, and bioarchaeology. This microscopy imaging suite is a user-friendly system that will impact the large group of students and researchers, from the undergraduate through to the postdoctoral level, who are part of the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State (FACTS) at Texas State University, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). As an asset of FACTS, this equipment will foster synergistic collaborative research and interactive teaching.  The addition of the microscopy suite will elevate the new PhD in Applied Anthropology Program and enhance faculty and student federally funded research in forensic anthropology, biology, and archaeology. The associated activities include the scientific training of women and underrepresented groups in histology and surface imaging, undergraduate STEM training, graduate student research and professionalization, and the expansion of FACTS workshops to include histology and surface imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microscopy suite will allow for fast imaging of a variety of samples from 1x-1000x at one workstation which consists of the DM6M compound microscope, M205C stereosmicroscope, and Aperio ScopScan CS 2. This will be used to capture evidence from skeletal trauma, zooarchaeological samples, and artifact assemblages. Combined with existing FACTS resources, this equipment will support innovative experimental studies including controlled human decomposition experiments that can model the microscopic diagenesis of human bone throughout the post-mortem interval, as well as macroscopic trauma investigation from vulture scavenging. The associated stereoscope with imaging software will also allow for novel and detailed 3D modeling of skeletal trauma and pathology from documented collections as well as forensic casework and bioarchaeological samples. The acquisition of this equipment will help build and make available to researchers the first ever referential catalog of histological human variation from the rapidly expanding Texas State University Donated Skeletal Collection (TXSTDSC). The microscopy system will enable FACTS to build on existing research programs that focus on bone histology in various contexts including the investigation of human vs nonhuman bone differentiation, histological mammal species identification, human ageing, dental histology season-of-death estimation, dental histology studies of pathology and stress, the application of GIS technology to study bone histomorphology, and histological human variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Diet is thought to be one such factor; however, the relationship between diet and biological aging is not well understood, and efforts to characterize this relationship have struggled to disentangle the effects of diet from other variables. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the effect of diet on the rate of biological aging using a newly developed epigenetic clock, a biomarker of biological age. This fundamental research will advance knowledge about human biology, life history, and senescence. The project may also inform public health and aging research by quantifying how lifestyle factors like diet ""get under the skin"" to influence the aging process and age-related disease. In addition, this project will contribute to the education, training and professional development of a female graduate student in a STEM field, and will include science outreach and education activities to engage with K-12 and public audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanisms that regulate the rate of biological aging are unknown but may have origins in the epigenome, a collection of chemical modifications to DNA that influence how genes are turned on or off. The epigenome is able to connect environment to genetics, and therefore plays a key role in explaining how environment and lifestyle factors can shape the pace of biological aging at the molecular level. Recently, age predictor models called epigenetic clocks have been developed that use age-associated changes in the epigenome to generate estimates of biological age. These clocks can be used to study the phenomenon of accelerated aging, where biological age exceeds chronological age. This project will construct a multi-tissue epigenetic clock and use this clock to test the effect of diet on biological age in a non-human primate model. The central hypothesis of this research is that an obesogenic diet accelerates biological aging and caloric restriction slows biological aging. The researchers will collect and analyze genome-wide methylation data from banked liver samples using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and combine these data with previously collected RRBS data from blood samples. A comparative non-human primate model with similar life history and disease risk can provide important insights into human aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Since its inception in 2003, DEL has funded hundreds of institutes and conferences, fellowships, and doctoral dissertations. In addition to ""standard"" documentation projects, increasingly, projects have come to include cross-disciplinary collaboration benefitting language revitalization and teaching, and community collaboration and capacity-building. These events will offer the opportunity for both reflection on significant achievements from DEL projects in the past fifteen years, and also for discussion about what directions documentation, archival preservation, and revitalization projects should take for the future. These events will allow participants to demonstrate how the science of documentation research can be co-constructed, from project conception, through to methods, and on to outputs, via considering indigenous interpretations and knowledge. The events will also allow participants to share how their documentation research has facilitated construction of sustainable community collaborations and educational opportunities, and fostered the rethinking of power distribution in situations of community involvement in documentation research. Broader impacts include the cross-pollination of ideas from different disciplinary perspectives, the potential for increased participation by Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives and American Indians, historically underrepresented groups in linguistics, and the evaluation of the impact of federal funding from two distinct agencies in terms of intellectual merit and broader impacts, merit review criteria at NSF determined by the National Science Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These events are scheduled to coincide with and complement LSA-organized celebrations of the 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. Led by two NSF DEL award holders, the events will provide a platform for case studies of demonstrating the relevance of documentation research to science more generally, and also how funded projects provide training opportunities for community members, and members' roles in valuable resource creation. Importantly, the project will support the attendance of students and community partners, allowing for multiple viewpoints and perspectives about shaping and conducting documenting research for, by, and with language communities. The methodology employed will include pre-event dialogue between participants and project leaders to shape presentations and discussions according to project goals, and will also include allotted time during the events for audience-participant interaction. The outcomes of this project will articulate and promote community-based approaches toward the conceptualization and carryout of future documentation research. The participant collaborators will disseminate recommendations and best practices for community-oriented documentation research, and through post-conference publications, they will also provide examples and resources for future project directors and those with whom they partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The doctoral student will evaluate the decision-making process about an emblematic water transfer by evaluating more than a century of social, regulatory, and environmental change. During this time-period, the public, private, and tribal interests considered by decision-makers have themselves changed amid drastic shifts in federal Indian policy, expanding public interest in environmental protection, and emerging coalitions of unlikely allies. Illustrating how natural resources policy intersects with federal Indian policy in practice, the research results will be summarized in policy briefs for government agencies that navigate that intersection when making decisions about land and water management. Educational and outreach tools will be developed to raise awareness about indigenous histories and perspectives that have often been overlooked and marginalized in water policy debates. Research findings will be disseminated to broader audiences through publication in popular media outlets and distribution of teaching resources. This project will support the training of a female doctoral student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated qualitative methods (ethnography, legal, and archival) will be used to capture the multifaceted processes that shape decision-making about large water transfers: legal and policy research to establish the relevant laws and policies on the books; archival research and agency interviews to elucidate the rationales guiding decisions in light of those policies; and participant observation and stakeholder interviews to examine how those decisions are implemented, received, and reshaped on the ground. Focused on decision-making about the transfer of water from Owens Valley to Los Angeles, California dating back to the early 1900s, this research will examine (1) how urban control over rural land and water resources is asserted, maintained, and justified over time; (2) how federal actions on behalf of the public interest intersect with the federal government's obligations as trustee for tribal interests; and (3) how indigenous struggles for water, land, and sovereignty articulate with the efforts of other rural actors challenging urban resource control and its impacts. In addition to illustrating how conflicting interests and obligations are weighed in decision-making about large water transfers, this project will offer insight into how indigenous and rural communities are working to reshape the frameworks, values, and objectives underpinning those decisions.

Whether and in what ways the welfare of adopted and fostered children improves outside their natal environment are subjects of much debate. Important factors affecting the welfare of adopted and fostered children include: the circumstances that lead to adoption and fosterage; differences between the activities and treatment of adopted and fostered children and of biological children; and societal acceptance versus stigma surrounding adoption and fosterage. Understanding how these factors interact to facilitate or inhibit successful outcomes for adopted and fostered children is critical for tailoring family programs to suit the individual needs of the many children who are reared primarily by non-natal parents in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted in the Melanesian island nation of Vanuatu, where adoption and fosterage are commonplace and arise in contexts comparable to adoption and fosterage among minority populations in the United States. The research team, including a postdoctoral scholar, two ni-Vanuatu graduate students, and an international team of highly trained PIs, will investigate the causes and consequences of adoption and fosterage using an evolutionary framework that seeks to understand how adoption and fosterage contribute to familial success. The researchers will use a diverse set of methods that leverage the significant variation in these practices in Vanuatu to evaluate which specific factors or sets of factors best predict differences in child outcomes. Specifically, the investigators will use questionnaires, interviews, dietary and activity recall assessments, and anthropometric measurements of health to describe the circumstances surrounding adoption and fosterage and to tie such circumstances to differences in child health and well-being. Findings from the research will provide insight into tailoring support for adoptive and foster families by examining how social and demographic factors contribute to variation in the welfare of adopted and fostered children as compared to their biological counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In contrast, modern artificial intelligence systems like Siri and Alexa need to be trained extensively on massive data sets; even then the linguistic abilities of such systems lag far behind those of a child. Scientific research on language acquisition and structure has taught us that children come to the task of language learning with preconceptions of what their language will look like. They use such preconceptions, referred to as ""biases"", to guide their learning, favoring language structures that are compatible with those biases. By structuring computers systems to incorporate these biases, we could construct computer interfaces that would be more effective not only for languages such as English and Spanish, but also for the many languages where training data is scarce, spoken in smaller communities within the United States and internationally. Moreover, understanding more about how the biases necessary for language learning can be instantiated in a computer model will help to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of these human biases: are they specific to language or are they the result of more general properties of human cognition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project explores the learning of regularities in natural language syntax by computer systems. The focus will be specifically on systems based on neural networks, which have been behind the recent revolutionary advances in language technologies. The project will study a wide range of neural network architectures, some with explicitly represented linguistic biases and some not, and compare them with respect to their abilities to learn carefully defined linguistic patterns. In contrast to past work that has evaluated linguistic knowledge of neural networks indirectly through a language modeling (word prediction) task, this project instead explores tasks that are formulated as transformations, which map one linguistic form to another (e.g., question formation, verbal inflection, negation, passivization, mapping to logical form). Not only are such mappings at the basis of a widely applied class of neural network architectures, so-called sequence to sequence networks, but they are also a common way of characterizing syntactic processes in linguistics. As a result, the use of such mappings allows a more direct assessment of the networks' linguistic abilities. Part of the project will involve the collaborative development of training and testing datasets for the mappings, with involvement by an interdisciplinary team of linguists and computer scientists, and these will be made available as a resource for the entire research community.  These datasets will then be used as the basis for the detailed analysis of neural network representations of linguistic structure. Furthermore, explicit comparisons will be carried out between neural network and human performance on the mapping tasks under study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, in recent years, venues for learning about and sharing current research on Southeast Asia languages have been vanishingly rare within the United States. Thus, this project aims to bring together scholars to present current research focused on Southeast Asian languages for an unprecedented week-long event in May 2020 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This week-long event comprises three professional meetings on the languages of Southeast Asia that have not traditionally been held together---the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society (SEALS), the International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian Linguistics (ISMIL), and the International Symposium on the Language of Java (ISLOJ)---alongside a special series of master classes on cutting-edge topics in several sub-disciplines in linguistics. SEALS, the largest of the three meetings, is internationally-recognized as the foremost conference for disseminating research on Southeast Asian linguistics. ISMIL and ISLOJ are important venues for two linguistically important yet sorely under-researched areas of western Indonesia. Thus, by bringing together these previously disparate meetings, this project promises to foster communication and collaboration between like-minded scholars who may not otherwise interact. The special series of master classes leverages specializations of faculty at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in experimental, theoretical and documentary linguistics, offering students and scholars from the US and various Southeast Asian countries important educational opportunities that promise to promote the progress of the scientific study of human language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding from the National Science Foundation will be used to increase the diversity of participants at this week-long event on Southeast Asian languages by offering funding to US students as well as students and scholars from Southeast Asia who would not otherwise be able to travel to the United States. Broadening participation in this week-long event has the potential to be transformative in forging new collaborations and creating new threads of linguistics research. The master classes will provide important training at basic and advanced levels on cutting-edge research methodologies and current topics in several sub-disciplines of linguistics. These workshops will be targeted at students and scholars from Southeast Asia because of their potential to make a significant impact on the future of linguistic research on the languages of Southeast Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

As immigrants settle in increasing numbers throughout US suburbs, the rescaling of immigration policies to the local level affect an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, with significant impacts on suburban towns and mixed-status families. This research will consider the significance of the everyday navigation practices of different migrant communities in suburbia by advancing theories in political geography, cultural placemaking, and ethnic studies. This research project centers on the specific insights offered by suburban residents. The findings will contribute to better understanding how the increase in the immigrant population across many midwestern states has led to divergent approaches in local immigration enforcement, particularly across post-industrial cities, with implications for human well-being. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will use a mixed methods approach to examine the relationship between the local politics of immigration and economics, and how they structure the lives of suburban communities. Specifically, this research examines (1) how the issue of immigration shapes local approaches to economic revitalization; and (2) how and why some immigrants and mixed-status families alter their everyday practices to navigate local contexts. These research questions will be answered through a content analysis of city council meeting notes and news media sources, participant observation at local cultural events and organizational meetings, key informant interviews with city officials and local leaders, in-depth semi-structured interviews with immigrants and mixed-status families, and participatory photovoice documentation. Photovoice will be used to create a booklet which will be used as an educational tool for community members and local officials. The study will investigate these questions in Chicago, Illinois, and will provide new insights into how processes of immigration and mixed-status families shape local economic revitalization projects in post-industrial suburbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Given that attended information is privileged by the brain, understanding and predicting what information is granted access to brain processing becomes an important endeavor. It has been argued that salient events (those that are very different from the surrounding environment) as well as information that is related to the current goal (i.e., task-relevant) are granted such access. The current work aims to extend this arguably simple notion of attentional orienting, to test the hypothesis that attentional selection can depend on may factors other than salience and task relevance. A better understanding of critical factors that determine how attentional selection is distributed in a scene could be used in various applied fields such as: design of interactive and ergonomic panels (e.g., car dashboards, instrumental panels, airplane cockpits, air traffic control monitors); enhanced training programs across multiple industries ranging from training drivers and machine operators to security personnel (e.g., airport baggage screeners) to neurologists reading X-rays for evidence of cancer; and developing new beneficial rehabilitative programs for persons suffering from various attentional disorders (Attention Deficit Disorder, visuo-spatial neglect, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given a critical mass of knowledge acquired on how salient and task-relevant aspects of the scene contribute to attentional allocation, the time is ripe to probe various ways in which task-irrelevant properties of the environment constrain attentional allocation. The proposed research program tests a set of novel predictions regarding the influence of task-irrelevant properties of the scene to attentional selection. Our goal is to rigorously test the hypothesis that task-irrelevant information (such as semantics, affordances, size, diagnosticity), constrains attentional selection by directly acting on spatial and object representations. While extensive past research has demonstrated that relevant information constrains attentional selection, we ask a more fundamental question whether different types of task-irrelevant information impinge on attentional control even when not directly relevant to the current goal.  Predictions will be tested in real world scenes, and by utilizing real world objects. Both, behavioral profile (with the use of various psychophysics and eye-movement techniques) as well as the neural underpinnings of this mechanism (by employing neuroimaging techniques), will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This assumption, however, is largely untested and there is good reason to think that it is wrong. The investigator's preliminary studies asked a basic question with fundamental implications:  Do speakers and listeners each walk away from a conversation with the same idea about what was said? The answer is no. Speakers are much more likely to remember what was said than the person who was listening. The proposed work takes as a starting point these asymmetries in memory for conversations in order to generate novel predictions regarding the interplay between memory and language use in conversation. Anticipated findings will provide insight into when conversational partners are likely to have similar memories for what was said, and when their memories are likely to differ. The resulting discoveries could change basic recommendations for how to engage in a successful conversation, both in high stakes settings (business negotiations, dispute mediation, first dates), but also in day-to-day life. The findings may also guide expectations about what humans are likely to remember based on conversations with devices such as ""Alexa,"" in turn providing insights for device design and human-technology interactions. Potential implications for pedagogy include recommendations for improving communication in teacher-student interactions and in group projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops and tests the predictions of a theoretical view of shared conversational knowledge that offers a radical departure from current views and makes competing predictions. A series of 10 experiments tests the hypothesis that following conversation, partners will retain predictably different memories of the conversation. As a result, despite their shared experience of conversing, partners will have a different perspective on what was said, influencing future decisions and interactions in predictable ways. The work will also provide insights into mechanisms of language processing in ecologically valid settings. Broader impacts include  opportunities for graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students to conduct independent research projects. Special efforts are made to recruit students from under-represented groups. All de-identified data generated by this research will be made publicly available on the internet. In sum, the work has the potential to advance understanding of psychological and linguistic processes, advance computer dialog systems, and offer insights into pedagogical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

These everyday (but essential) judgments usually require us to separate the distinct causes in the world that generate sound. We hear multiple people talking at once, but can attend to the one we are interested in. We can tell whether a sound was produced in a large or small room, or an empty or furnished apartment, but can also identify what the sound was. And if an object is dropped on a table, we can usually tell the object's approximate weight but also the material the table is made of, just by listening. These abilities are critical to our interactions with the world and will be critical to reproduce in machine hearing systems for robots, automobiles, and other technologies. Here the investigators propose to investigate human abilities to decompose sound into its constituent causes and to build machine systems that can replicate these abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will jointly pursue two goals. First, the investigators will build models of how sound is generated in the world. This aspect of the work will combine insights from physics and acoustics with empirical measurements of sound, focusing on how forces imparted to objects resonate within the object to yield sound, and on how the resulting sound is altered by reflections off of environmental surfaces on its way to a listener's ears. Second, the investigators will develop a computational framework to infer the most likely explanation of a sound in terms of the events in the world that could have generated it. This aspect of the work will leverage recent advances in artificial intelligence research that render such inferences newly tractable. The resulting machine hearing systems will be compared with human listeners in a series of experiments, with the goal of improving the models of sound generation and the inference algorithms in order to match human auditory abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Many assume that psychological processes are universal and not affected by native country or culture. But recently there has been increased appreciation of the ways in which an individual?s background can impact perceptual or memory processes. Prior work on cultural differences has largely considered memory and visual perception as separate processes and most of the work on visual processes has been restricted to evaluating face perception. The current project examines whether cultures differ in the visual features they preferentially perceive: Do they tend to perceive global, overall shape or fine detail? Does culture affect how quickly each type of visual information is processed or whether it dominates conscious experience? Does any difference in perception affect later memory for scenes? These are issues of global importance and will contribute to the development of a globally-minded workforce by exposing students and trainees to cross-cultural research. The investigators will also engage in outreach activities at a diverse local high school. Participating in these outreach activities will also train members of the team in effective scientific outreach and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four experiments will investigate cultural differences in 1) the relative dominance of high versus low spatial frequency information in vision, for stable percepts as well as those that compete dynamically for dominance, 2) brain markers of early attention processes versus markers of expectation or salience, using electroencephalography (EEG), 3) short-term memory, in comparison with perceptual judgments, and 4) measures of sensitivity (i.e., ability to accurately distinguish different types of information) versus response bias (i.e., a tendency to respond in a particular way). Extant models of visual perception and memory were predominantly developed based on the study of ""WEIRD"" subjects (Western, educated, and from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries).

Memories we have acquired during the day are reactivated during sleep, causing changes in memory storage in brain networks. Dreams in particular may contribute to language learning and problem solving, but one problem with the scientific study of dreaming is that we gain knowledge of a dream only after an individual has awoken. In the waking state, dreams may be recalled in a fragmentary or distorted way, or barely remembered at all. This research will overcome those limitations by allowing dreamers to communicate about their dream experiences while they are having the dreams. For example, using eye-movement and muscle-twitch signals, dreamers can indicate that they are aware of dreaming, and an experimenter can communicate with a dreamer with softly spoken words or other sounds. This strategy will open up new avenues for understanding more about the importance of sleep, with many important implications for society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a set of innovative methods to advance knowledge of the various cognitive benefits of sleep. Prior studies showed that spatial memory could be changed during sleep through the method of Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR). This approach of strategically presenting soft sounds during sleep will be modified to investigate whether vocabulary learning and problem solving can be improved in association with REM sleep or in association with a dream. To enable this novel perspective on dreaming, people will be interviewed from within a dream. Experimenters will issue softly spoken questions, and volunteers will communicate back with a code based on specific eye movements and muscle twitches, readily measured electrophysiologically, all while REM sleep is maintained. People typically experience a dream with a high degree of acceptance and a lack of critical evaluation - they fail to realize that the experience is merely a dream. In a lucid dream, one gains the elusive insight of being in a dream. However, lucid dreams can seldom be summoned at will, and on the rare occasions when people succeed in having a lucid dream in a lab, they often forget pre-assigned goals. These challenges will be overcome by: (a) pre-sleep training to strategically link specific sound cues with action plans; (b) monitoring sleep physiology to coordinate stimulation; and (c) presenting sounds to remind dreamers to evaluate their experience to determine if they are dreaming, and to then engage in specific activities such as rehearsing recently learned foreign words or attempting to reach a solution to a cognitive puzzle. Increasing the frequency of lucid dreams through these methods will make it possible to examine cognition during the course of interactive dreaming. Results from this project will expand understanding of cognitive capabilities during sleep, and will provide new information on the extent to which sleep cognition can assist with language learning, problem solving, and other tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This task involves analyzing all the visual objects and backgrounds in the scene. This is a complicated task because the brain has to separate objects from the background. The brain also has to process the color, shape, and size of all objects. The aim of the research is to build a mathematical model that can find objects in scenes, despite the difficulty of the problem. The model is inspired by the visual system. It uses two ways to process information. First, it uses central vision to get a fine-grained analysis of the object it is looking at. Second, it also uses peripheral vision, which is the area around and away from central vision. Peripheral vision can analyze several objects at the same time but is less precise than central vision. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a free, open-source software toolbox that anyone can use. The toolbox will visualize how the visual system processes complex scenes. It will determine which regions in a scene should be ignored and which regions the eyes should focus on. One strength of the proposal is that it makes specific predictions that can be tested in various fields of neuroscience. It might also lead to improvements in visual aids for visually impaired individuals because it can guide users toward areas in a scene that are likely to contain the target object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point for the proposed work is a mathematically explicit model of goal-directed visual processing. The model incorporates two components of visual complexity: a parameter that measures the visual difference between objects in the scene and the object the observer is looking for (the target) and a parameter that measures how similar objects in the scene are to one another. The preliminary work indicated that the model is very capable of predicting how long it will take observers to find targets in visually complex scenes. The first two goals of the present research aim at evaluating other components of visual complexity to improve the model and its ability to predict visual processing in more complex visual scenes. The experiments in Goals 1 and 2 will help determine how to combine the visual qualities of objects (such as color, shape and texture) as well as how to account for the contrast between objects and their background. Results from Goals 1 and 2 will directly guide the development of a computational toolbox. The toolbox will allow users to visualize visual processing of simple and complex scenes and make predictions about where observers are likely to move their eyes as a function of their current goals (freely inspect the scene or find a specific object within it). The proposed work combines behavioral psychophysics and computational simulations (Goals 1 and 2), toolbox implementation and eye-tracking validation (Goal 3). The merits of the toolbox include the fact that: 1) it combines different types of visual processing (visual conspicuity contrast and target template contrast), 2) it can predict eye movements over different time scales, and 3) it can evaluate the contribution of these two types of processing to performance. This implementation is important because the contribution of these two processes is known to vary as a function of search goals (free-view vs. goal-directed) and search strategy adopted by observers (active search vs. passive search). Finally, another innovation of the toolbox is that it will be able to make predictions when targets are only defined in abstract terms, that is, when observers only have vague descriptions about the item they are supposed to find in the scene, which is particularly challenging for current computer vision systems to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Yet there is no consensus on a theory of how the color visual system accomplishes its most basic tasks: detection, discrimination, and hue appearance.  The experiments in this comprehensive study will provide a complete, computational model for the basic operations of human color vision.  The model is fully mechanistic, in the sense that it is built from simple circuits that could easily be built into artificial vision systems that use color for detecting objects, recognizing faces, and decoding emotions.  The model will offer concrete hypotheses for other neuroscientists to test: it makes predictions for studies of single-cell physiology as well as for functional neuroimaging.  The model can even be used in applied domains such as human factors engineering, textiles, and marketing, example fields where understanding color discrimination is vital.  A subset of the model has already been tested and shown to provide remarkably successful predictions for detection, color matching and color discrimination in limited conditions.  What is needed is the basic data to set the model parameters in all of color space.  The proposed project will provide that data, fit the complete model, and test its application to multiple perceptual tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1986, when failures of the 'cardinal axis' color model were discovered by Krauskopf and colleagues, the field has lacked an agreed-upon model of the postreceptoral mechanisms of color detection and discrimination.  In our previous work, we showed that a simple model, with only 8 mechanisms, can account for detection and color matching in one plane of color space, and pilot data shows it also accounts for forced-choice discrimination at threshold.  No other color mechanism model has been shown to account so well for so many different perceptual phenomena. The project will extend our previous studies in two ways: (1) whereas the previous experiments were limited to a single plane in cone space, the new ones will explore the entire 3-dimensional space of color stimuli; (2) two additional procedures, forced-choice chromatic discrimination and hue scaling, will be used to define the properties of the color mechanisms and test the model predictions.   All the measurements will take place under three different chromatic noise masking conditions, and all the subjects will be tested in all of the conditions, to allow for individual differences.   Because it builds upon our prior successes, the research is highly-likely to solve the central problem in the field, developing a fully-computable model to explain detection and discrimination in the full 3D color space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems participated in co-funding of the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Simultaneously, it will document a specialized genre. Growing evidence shows that more specialized genres and knowledge in languages are vulnerable to attrition. Through an analysis of particular linguistic elements, the project will provide greater detail about an endangered language that displays a highly complex morphological system. Because the topic is limited to a particular kind of specialized speech (the matters of state), the analysis will also expand knowledge about the role of sociolinguistic and other factors in the linguistic shift, including linguistic ideologies about who should speak a language, how and where it should be spoken. The focus will be on Nahuatl (ISO 639-3 NHE), a Uto-Aztecan language possessing a complex morphology of prefixes and suffixes that interacts with the discursive content of speech. This complex morphology (quite different than English morphology, for example) creates a testing bed for how specialized genres interact with specific aspects of a language, here extensive suffixing and prefixing processes, as well as how different speakers use the same grammatical elements in different ways. Project activities include the development of pedagogical materials, a workshop for elementary school teachers in the village, and the training of two native speakers in linguistic documentation methodologies. Broader impacts include the training of a doctoral student, a public repository of audio and video recordings and transcriptions archived at the University of Texas, Austin's AILLA repository, and the strengthening of collaborations between Mexican and American scholars. <br/><br/>The project will expand knowledge about the linguistic and extra-linguistic factors that influence the maintenance or the shift of one language to another. The project will collect video and audio recordings of the oratory taking place in assemblies made up by women-only, men-only, and mixed groups from Nahua Mexican society to identify rhetorical strategies such as persuasion. This language is spoken in various parts of Mexico; this project will specifically document the variety located on the east-central side of the country.  Usage will be analyzed for speaker variation as pertains to particular grammatical elements, as well as more ""poetic"" kinds of constructions such as metaphor, alliteration, parallelism, anaphora, and metonymy. Through the analyses of grammatical constructions in these civic- and economic-oriented genres, the CoPI will investigate how grammatical constructions and linguistic strategies used in governmental contexts are used by language users to accomplish social goals during the course of speeches on policy and civic topics. An analysis of the markers for linguistic categories like direction or future, frequently found in this specialized genre, will lead to a better understanding of their grammatical properties as well as how speakers of Nahuatl use these structures for different purposes. The researcher will use linguistic ethnography as the central methodology, supplemented by in-depth interviews.

In order to develop an understanding of human language, the discipline of linguistics requires detailed information about languages that are significantly different from the more familiar languages that were studied in the past. This project will produce a grammatical description of Chepang, an endangered language spoken in Central Nepal by around 48,000 people. Chepang belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family, which also includes Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese. Chepang shows grammatical patterns which are very unusual in the world's languages. To take one important example, Chepang sentences do not have the same kind of subjects and objects as English or most other languages. In Chepang, verb agreement follows a very complex ""hierarchical"" pattern in which any first or second person argument of the clause, whether subject, object, or even the possessor of a subject or object, governs agreement (so that in the Chepang translation of the sentence ""She scolded your child"" the verb would agree with ""you"", not with the subject of the sentence). Languages like this are very rare; they include a few Native languages of North America, a few in South America, and a few Sino-Tibetan languages of the Himalayas. It is important to document this kind of unusual grammar in order to understand the full range of possible human language. The project will bring U.S. resources into Nepal and do some capacity building, acting like a type of ""soft power"" in a region where other foreign countries are making extensive connections of their own. The analysis of the language produced in the doctoral dissertation will serve as a foundation to create pedagogical materials for future mother-tongue based multilingual education programs. Broader impacts also include training and research experience for the doctoral student who will carry out the fieldwork and write the grammar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce a reference grammar of Chepang [ISO 639-3:cdm], generating a detailed description of the phonological and grammatical structures of the language, and a transcribed set of spoken narratives. Doctoral student Marie-Caroline Pons will work in close collaboration with members of different Chepang communities who live in the plains and hills of Makawanpur district, to audio/video record, transcribe, and translate a wide varieties of genres that will document the language, history, and life of the Chepang people, including narratives, ethnographical expository and procedural texts, as well as natural conversational interactions. Chepang has a number of grammatical features which are of great historical and theoretical interest, including the verbal agreement system mentioned above. At present very few full descriptions of languages of this kind exist, and there is debate in the field about how such languages work, and how this pattern relates to what occurs in more familiar languages. Because language documentation of this kind can only be carried out in a community of speakers, recording conversations and narratives from elders who are fluent speakers, the project requires extended research in Nepal. In addition to its contributions to the science of linguistics, and to our knowledge of Asian prehistory and Tibeto-Burman language change, the grammar which will be produced will be of considerable value to the Chepang community in the preservation of their language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The value of knowing more than one language is becoming increasingly relevant as technology develops and US industry connects with individuals all over the world, even with just a handheld device. People who speak multiple languages have greater potential to connect with a broader audience or customer base. At the same time, research has demonstrated that knowledge of more than one language can change some aspects of native language use: the burden associated with bilingualism can lead to subtle but significant disadvantages in some aspects of cognitive performance (e.g., vocabulary), but to significant advantages in other aspects (e.g., resolving conflict, sustained focus of attention). Such differences have potentially serious implications in many settings, including educational and medical settings. For example, how should bilingual children best be served in school settings to enable them to learn English quickly while maintaining knowledge of their Heritage Language spoken in the home? What methods are best to pursue when attempting to identify learning disabilities in bilingual children? At the other end of the lifespan, in aging bilinguals, what is the best method for identifying current or possibly imminent cognitive decline? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies will investigate the consequences of bilingualism for language and cognitive processing by comparing bilinguals with monolinguals in a series of behavioral experiments designed to test how bilinguals choose which language they intend to speak and how this process is more generally related to choice behaviors. Bilinguals will read aloud sentences that mix languages, will be asked to switch between languages or between other (non-linguistic) tasks, name pictures in both languages, or translate between languages. Relationships among these tasks will be examined. A driving hypothesis underlying the current work is that 1) bilinguals maintain control over which language they speak at least in part by relying on cognitive abilities not related to language and 2) bilingual language use can improve general abilities related to rapid switching, monitoring, and resolving conflict between response alternatives (e.g., needing to avoid distraction). This hypothesis will be tested by examining how performance changes when more than one language must be controlled and whether training with language switching improves general cognitive abilities and vice versa (e.g., if managing response competition transfers across non-linguistic and linguistic tasks). These studies will clarify the relationship between bilingualism and cognitive test performance and establish conditions that minimize possible costs and maximize potential benefits of bilingualism. The proposed studies will develop theoretical models of cognitive control and bilingual language processing, which will lay the groundwork necessary to develop theory-driven approaches to assessment and treatment of cognitive and linguistic abilities of young and aging monolinguals and bilinguals alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project will investigate the neural basis of this ability by studying individuals with brain injury due to stroke. The goal is to understand how and where localized brain injury leads to impairments in math skills, thereby revealing the parts of the brain that are crucial for normal function. The work will examine the ability to make judgments about magnitude, a fundamental skill thought to rest upon an innate approximate number system, as well the abilities that rest upon cultural transmission of symbol systems for number (e.g., through classroom instruction). The relationship between these different types of skills, and their neural substrates, remains a point of significant debate. To make progress, stroke survivors will participate in the study. All participants will complete a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session to acquire images of their brain, and a set of behavioral tasks probing sensory, motor, language, general cognitive, and mathematical abilities. A series of statistical analyses will combine the brain and behavioral data, in order to identify sites of brain injury that are associated with: (1) specific impairments in approximate number representation and estimation, (2) specific impairments in precise number representation and calculation, and (3) impairments in math ability that are secondary to impairments in language or more general cognitive functions. The work should help to adjudicate between theories of math ability and inform future studies examining math learning and intervention strategies for struggling learners. Importantly, the project will be deeply intertwined with undergraduate education and research mentorship. This will occur by embedding the data collection into an advanced undergraduate laboratory course and summer research internship programs, with graduate students contributing to the instruction. The result will be a multilayered, interdisciplinary, and diverse learning context for experiential science learning that will be of broad educational impact. Additionally, at the conclusion of the project the data (without identifying information) will be placed into an open repository for neuroscience research. No other dataset like this currently exists, and so this will give researchers access to unique and highly valuable dataset that will be suitable for addressing many research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lesion method involves studying patterns of preserved and impaired abilities in participants with brain damage. By combining information about patterns of behavioral performance and corresponding locations of neural damage, causal inferences can be drawn about the functions supported by particular brain regions and their white matter connections. This project will use the lesion method to investigate the relationship between different aspects of numeracy. The participants in the study will be ~ 160 individuals with left-hemisphere focal brain lesions, and an exploratory group of ~ 40 individuals with right-hemisphere lesions. All participants will complete a neuroimaging session to acquire structural and functional brain volumes, and a battery of behavioral tasks probing sensory, motor, general cognitive, linguistic, and mathematical abilities. Participants with evidence of impaired numeracy, or aphasia without intact numeracy, will be invited to return for a second behavioral-only session. This secondary assessment will involve a battery of tasks that will probe numeracy skills in greater depth, as well as general cognitive abilities relevant for skilled math performance. For the primary analyses, voxelwise lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses will be used to test predictions derived from theoretical models of numeracy. These include the predictions that impairments in number comparison will be associated with damage to the inferior parietal sulcus, impairments in verbal fact retrieval will be associated with damage to the angular gyrus, and impairments in ordinality will be associated with damage to premotor cortex. Secondary analyses will permit more detailed examination of associations and dissociations across our numeracy, language, and cognitive tasks. This will include the use of principal components analysis and other data-driven techniques to discover patterns of impairments across our battery of tasks and test for associated loci of neural damage. Finally, exploratory analyses will probe for hemispheric differences in the representation of number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

So far, most of this research has focused on the adult's brain, as opposed to the child's. Given our poor understanding of the neurobiology of language development, we lack an important background for understanding children's language disorders and for planning surgical treatments for children with neurological disorders such as epilepsy, since such surgeries need to spare language cortex. This project uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to establish this critical background. The focus will be on two basic processes that form the foundation of human language: word retrieval and the composition of words into larger phrases. Elementary school children from New York City public schools will be invited to participate via science outreach activities in the schools. The data will be entered into a public database that will provide a resource for research and education. The experimental protocol is a combination of a tightly controlled design, built upon prior research on adults, and a naturalistic stimulus, containing fun science-themed narratives. Data from the naturalistic stimulus will offer vast analysis possibilities. To assure that the possibilities are maximally leveraged by researchers, these data will be released to the public on a rapid timescale, at the end each project year. This work will offer research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The project is also a significant STEM opportunity for the participating children, as during the lab visit, the experimenter will explain the basics of MEG and how one can capture tiny magnetic fields inside human brains. Overall, the project aims to transform the neuroscience of language in children by providing the basic science that is needed for more detailed understanding to emerge in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific scientific objective of this project is to characterize the spatiotemporal profile of lexical retrieval and phrasal composition in 1st, 3rd, and 5th graders, with their parents serving as the adult controls. The experimental protocol offers (i) the first systematic spatio-temporal characterization of children's neural processing of single words and phrases, as compared to the activity profiles of the children's parents; (ii) a tightly controlled within-subjects and within-items comparison of the neural circuits involved in language comprehension vs. production in children and adults and (iii) a measurement of a simple form of dialogue, engaging both the comprehension and production of words and phrases within a brief trial. An important outcome of the research is a database, from which users will be able to download activity time-courses for specific brain regions during the three experimental tasks. Study participants will also listen to a naturalistic stimulus, with a fun science themed content designed for children. The naturalistic stimulus will allow assessing whether results from the controlled laboratory tasks scale up to a more ecologically valid setting. All MEG recordings from the project will be made publicly available. The project is a large-scale endeavor to engage a diverse sample of New York City children in a neuroscience activity that will significantly advance our understanding of how language is processed in the brains of elementary-school children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Although multiple theories have been proposed to explain age-related changes occurring in the lab, there is reason to believe that some laboratory assessments of memory may overestimate age-related deficits. Such overestimations can cause researchers and practitioners to propose and implement ineffective support strategies and solutions for older adults. The proposed research examines the possibility that researchers have been systematically misinterpreting age-related changes in memory by not giving older adults enough time to complete the task. The research looks at individual differences across individuals, as well as at changes within an individual over time, to test multiple competing theories that have been proposed to explain these changes. The outcomes of this research will improve the likelihood of eventual translational impact of laboratory studies, opening the possibility for new types of strategies that older adults can be taught to maximize their chance of memory success. This project will also encourage communication of a realistic and positive portrayal of memory changes with aging to individuals who will benefit the most from this knowledge - older adults and individuals in the community who regularly engage with and teach older adults - using social media and in-person events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory complaints are common among older adults, and even healthy aging is associated with significant alterations in memory performance across tasks and domains. A prevailing view in the cognitive aging literature is that such changes in older adults are related to ineffective recruitment of sensory regions due to a global sensory deficit. The prominent piece of evidence in support of this theory from the cognitive neuroscience literature has been the prevalence of age-related decreases in posterior sensory recruitment across cognitive domains. Recent research has drawn the generality of this conclusion into question by revealing that age differences in sensory recruitment during memory tasks can reflect shifts in when sensory processes are engaged during retrieval rather than in whether they are engaged. In other words, aging may not strip away older adults' ability to engage sensory processes in the service of memory; but it may prevent them from engaging the processes in the same, fast manner as young adults. The proposed research brings this new possibility into focus, honing in on mechanisms that lead to temporal shifts in the recruitment of sensory regions and the behavioral consequences of these shifts. This research examines possible alternatives to the standard sensory deficit hypothesis, using cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. To accomplish the research aims, this proposal brings together a team of researchers who have a history of collaboration and complementary expertise in the cognitive neuroscience of aging and memory, structural MRI analysis, physiological age-related neural changes, and quantitative methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Such learning is critical for our ability to teach in educational settings, use public service announcements to inform the public about health benefits and risks, and create new strategies for national defense. Many new concepts are acquired without explicitly reasoning about how the concept works; for example, we may learn to simply avoid behaviors that lead to increased disease risk instead of actively making inferences and learning the underlying causal structure of how such risks emerge. The present proposal examines the cognitive and neurobiological processes that determine how and when people will use such active inferential processes to learn about new categories and concepts. By developing a better understanding of how inferential processes are engaged in category and concept learning, the study has the potential to help in any real-world settings in which such processes are used. For example, these results may help to identify strategies to enhance active inferential processing in education or public health communication, which can lead to better learning and health behavior outcomes. Finally, the project will directly support education of diverse students, who will be actively engaged in collecting and disseminating the data collected as part of the study. Through this learning opportunity, students will acquire valuable STEM skills related to data collection, analysis, and computer programming. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Neurobiological theories of category learning suggest that we use inferential processes such as rules and hypothesis testing to aid in acquiring new categories, but once categories are learned, active reasoning likely gives way to more general memory-based or associative strategies that have lower cognitive demands. The present proposal aims to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive tasks, and computational modeling to test (1) how the brain integrates novelty and uncertainty signals in deploying inferential reasoning processes during category learning and generalization, and (2) how such processes may differ depending on the stimulus properties that define a category - namely, whether rule-relevant features are easily verbalizable. The working hypothesis for this project is that the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) works with brain regions supporting novelty detection (medial temporal lobes) and decision making (lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex) to determine when to engage inferential processes to aid category learning. However, its ability to develop inferential strategies in a given situation may also depend on a learner's ability to encode rule-relevant stimulus features verbally using language. The overall goals of the study are as follows: (1) Test how activation in rlPFC and its connectivity with other regions involved in inferential processing track novelty and uncertainty during early rule-based learning, and assess whether any region's involvement varies based on feature verbalizability. (2) Test how rlPFC activation and connectivity with other regions involved in inferential processing track novelty and uncertainty during generalization of previously learned rules, and assess whether any region's involvement varies based on verbalizability of stimulus features. (3) Develop an encompassing computational model that accounts for participants' behavior and rlPFC's activation and interactions with other brain regions involved in inferential processing in the proposed learning and generalization experiments. The proposed studies and model have the potential to create a unified theory of inferential processing and rlPFC function in category learning that will be easily extendable to other basic cognitive processes like learning, memory, and decision-making that rely on similar underlying computational and neural mechanisms. By working toward a computationally defined mechanism for inferential processes in category learning, the present proposal will create generalizable knowledge of how to enhance inferential processing during category learning that may apply to real-world reasoning inside and outside of the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In a broader sense, the project addresses questions regarding the organization of human communities at varying scales, how people form identities, and the long-term effects of these processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of her Ph.D. dissertation research, Ms. Aragon will use archaeological data from across southern Arizona to examine how people in the prehispanic Southwest formed both relational and categorical identities among social groups and how those identities changed or persisted with the rise and decline of the Hohokam Ballcourt World during the eighth through twelfth centuries (A.D. 700-1100). The researchers will use a multiscalar network approach to reconstruct group identities in the Hohokam Ballcourt World based on material culture at 100-year intervals to create ""snapshots"" through time. In this way, the project addresses issues of group adaptation during times of cultural and ideological change and reorganization. The investigators will use understudied curated material and published reports to integrate and synthesize more than 50 years of fieldwork across the study region. Research with existing collections will add to the stock of information available to managing agencies and will contribute new information that can be used in the interpretation of sites for the public. Finally, this research will contribute new methods for studying identity across time and space, which will be useful to researchers investigating similar processes, both in the past and present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Recent research on the Terminal Classic in the Maya area shows that Maya communities were differentially affected by collapse processes and their responses were variable, including cases of disruption and abandonment, short flourishment, and resilience and transformation. Ortiz's research will focus on the detection of migration from a potential receiving end, a theme that has been addressed in other worldwide ancient migration cases but that has been minimally tracked in other Maya sub-regions. Questions about the effects of the Maya collapse, including the impact of lowland population movements, have been less frequently addressed for the highlands. The results of this research will contribute to the growing discussion on how social identity, specifically of the ancient Maya, intersects with technology, and how migrants can be detected in the archaeological record. Ortiz's work seeks to make a positive impact on the indigenous Qeqchi Maya living near the site by providing important culture-historical information from their own cultural past and promoting collaborative participation, re-ownership, and safekeeping of local cultural heritage. The results of the project seek to publicly discuss the myriad ways that Maya communities experienced the Maya collapse by contesting popular and catastrophic beliefs of this social process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Mr. Ortiz will conduct archaeological research at Kixpek, Guatemala. This ancient settlement is located at the northern edge of the highlands immediately south of the lowlands region. Funerary pottery found at the site indicates a Late Classic to Early Postclassic occupation (AD 600-1200), showing that the community lived through the Classic Maya collapse. The site of Kixpek on the Chixoy drainage presents an opportunity to examine how a highland community experienced social processes that happened during and after the Terminal Classic. Did migrants relocate among their neighbors at the northern highlands and what evidence of this migration is available at this region? Did highland ceramic technologies persist or change with the potential introduction of new social groups after the Maya collapse? Ortiz will conduct excavations in Group B and presumed habitation areas surrounding the main plaza in order to obtain pottery samples from pre- and post-Maya collapse periods of occupation. Laboratory analysis will include detailed ceramic analysis by stylistic and technological attributes through macroscopic and microscopic techniques for pottery classification. Ortiz will evaluate the continuities and changes in technological systems, specifically in pottery, obsidian, and burial practices at Kixpek, amidst the potential relocation of people after the Terminal Classic period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

With National Science Foundation (NSF) support, the LTRR operates an analysis program for tree-ring samples collected by LTRR and other archaeologists from Alaska to Argentina and from the Pacific Ocean to the Mississippi River. NSF support will allow the program to keep pace with the ever growing demand for archaeological tree-ring dating, and to maintain high production levels and short turnaround times. On average, more than 750 dates from 1500+ archaeological tree-ring samples are produced annually. These data are integrated into relevant archaeological contexts to construct refined cultural sequences and examine important issues of past human behavior that cannot be addressed without accurate, high resolution temporal control. Among these topics are absolute site, locality, and regional chronologies, social organization structure, intergroup interaction, and cultural adaptation to physical and social environments. The program actively promotes the expansion of archaeological tree-ring dating into new regions such as the Southwestern deserts, Great Basin, Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, Alaska, Mexico, and South America; it also supports student research both directly and indirectly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has a wide range of broader impacts. Its findings will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate classes in anthropology, geosciences, and other disciplines at the University of Arizona and other academic institutions. In addition, the project interacts with K-12 programs and provides public tours of the facility to an estimated 12,000 visitors and students annually; it provides instruction for visiting scholars from around the world and facilitates field and laboratory training for non-profit, governmental, private sector, and Native American programs. Students will accrue particular benefits from the reduced cost of analysis, thus allowing them to conduct extensive research at lower costs. The LTRR tree-ring sample collections and archives are unparalleled, easily accessed resources for archaeological research, and an under-construction digital database will enhance the research value of these resources. Increased understanding of long-term human adaptation to cultural and environmental variability and enhanced knowledge of past environmental processes will help develop and implement environmental and social policy. Project personnel will contribute directly to formulating policy for managing cultural and natural resources by federal, local, and tribal land management agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has additional intellectual merits. Exact dating and chronology building are crucial to understanding human behavior, human-environment interactions, and processes of sociocultural stability, variation, change, and social evolution. Either directly or indirectly (through tree-ring dated ceramics), tree-ring dating underlies the chronology of Southwestern prehistory and many aspects of the documented history of the region. The project will also generate climatic reconstructions that are combined with reconstructions produced by other paleoenvironmental disciplines such as geology, pollen analysis, volcanology, and trace element studies. In addition to illuminating past environmental processes, these integrated reconstructions will provide a solid empirical foundation for examining the interrelationships between human behavior and environmental variability. Finally, the project's efforts to expand research into areas previously thought to be unsuitable for archaeological tree-ring dating provide absolutely dated ""hinge points"" for archaeological chronologies in the Sonoran Desert, the Great Basin, the western Great Plains, Alaska, northern Mexico, and South America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Research suggests that our microbiome may influence a wide range of physiological functions and health, from immune function to mood. However, there are still many unanswered questions about how these microbes interact with each other and how those interactions affect human biology. By studying large networks of microbial interactions and functions in industrialized and non-industrialized human communities, this doctoral dissertation research will examine the extent of ecological diversity in human gut microbiomes and how differences in lifestyle impact this diversity. The research team will provide hands-on workshops to participant communities to discuss how their participation helps to advance microbiome research. The project will also support student training and mentoring of individuals from unrepresented groups in STEM, supporting broader participation in a rapidly developing area of biological research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans living a Western-industrialized lifestyle have markedly different microbiomes than those living a more traditional, non-industrial lifestyle, such as hunter-gatherers and rural farmers from developing countries. Earlier studies have determined that diet, antibiotic use, and contact between humans and other animals all have major impacts on microbiome diversity. In a number of these studies, the way in which microbial diversity was estimated did not necessarily account for the fact that microbiomes are complex ecologies. In this study, the researchers will investigate ecological dynamics and microbial interactions in microbiomes from humans and pigs on family farms in Oklahoma and compare them to humans and pigs from the African country of Burkina Faso. By comparing both humans and pigs in an industrialized country to a developing country, the researchers will document the effects of lifestyle on the human microbiome with a focus on human-animal interactions. By investigating the ecological dynamics of functional redundancy and resilience in gut microbiomes, the project will advance knowledge about complex microbial ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Yet there is an empirical and theoretical gap in our understanding of the individual-level processes underpinning leadership and the group-level consequences of leadership. How does the cognition of individual leaders translate into coordinated group action in the real world?  This project proposes using chimpanzees as a new model of human-like leadership to better understand the evolutionary origins of our own leadership patterns. We will bridge the gap between individual- and group-level phenomena by conducting matched research with semi-free ranging chimpanzees living in a sanctuary where we can do detailed assessments of cognition, and with chimpanzees living in the wild where we can look at complex group behavior in a natural setting. By matching datasets across these two contexts, we will be able to see how individual cognitive process translate into group action. While humans are thought to be uniquely able to establish leadership through prestige and collaboration instead of just pure physical domination, chimpanzees are our closest living relative, also show variation in how individuals obtain and maintain status in their groups. This project will therefore illuminate the evolutionary origins of human leadership, and also set a new agenda in evolutionary cognitive science for studying cognition in the wild. Training, education, and outreach from elementary school through to graduate school will be integrated throughout the project both domestically and abroad. As part of this proposal, we will develop a leadership module for children, using animal models to demonstrate different forms of leadership. We will implement this module through outreach at local schools and museums in the US and in 16 primary schools in Uganda. Undergraduates and high school students in the US will gain hand-on research experience through internships and in coursework. Two postdoctoral researchers and a graduate student will further gain international research experiences in the course of the project. This integrated approach to research and education will train a new generation of evolutionary cognitive scientists and disseminate primate research to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify individual leaders (those with outsized influence) in natural social groups across multiple contexts of behavior including dominance rank, initiation of group movements, resource acquisition, within-group mediation and inter-group aggression. The second aim is to create leadership profiles by characterizing individual variation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms of leaders across these contexts. At the sanctuary, 100+ chimpanzees across 5 social groups will be assayed for cognition (including social cognition, cooperation, and executive function); temperament; behavior (aggression and affiliation), and physiology (hormones and body size) to predict leadership. At the field site, similar assessments will be made of temperament, behavior, and physiology, drawing on a longitudinal database with 30 years of data on 150 wild chimpanzees. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that there are distinct pathways to leadership in chimpanzees, with intimidation-based and cooperative strategies being the most important, but knowledge and motivation anchoring some forms of leadership. The final aim is to understand how variation in leadership styles shapes the outcomes of collective action by examining several short-and long-term metrics of leadership success, including group cohesion, rewards received, and biological outcomes like reproductive success that can only be studied in the wild. This project will bridge individual-level and group-level perspectives on cognition, behavior, and physiology by leveraging the strengths of two natural populations of chimpanzees. The project will match experimental and observational techniques across sites on a scale never previously done, and will develop chimpanzees as a new model for human leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In the active voice the focus is on Mary as the instigator of the kicking. In the passive voice the focus is on the ball, and reference to Mary can even be omitted, as in ""The ball was kicked. "" A key feature of the active-passive distinction is its asymmetry: the active is the typical way of saying something, while the passive stands out as different, moving the focus away from the person initiating the action and adding ""was"" and ""by"" in the passive sentence. Active-passive distinctions have been documented in hundreds of the world's languages, leading many to assume the universality of this construction. However, recently scholars have begun to challenge this assumption, pointing to new data from previously undocumented languages suggesting that symmetrical voice distinctions exist. In other words, neither the active nor passive form is more basic. This project will investigate symmetrical voice in an underdocumented language, Western Subanon (ISO 639-3 suc), which makes even finer distinctions between types of active voice. Such distinctions are different from English in both the symmetry and the gradation of types of active voice. Broader impacts include a public repository of recordings and transcriptions, materials for use by community members and promotion of linguistic sustainability and modern language documentation techniques in the region. Other outcomes include the training of a doctoral student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoPI, a doctoral candidate at the University of Hawaii, will document and analyze Western Subanon, an endangered and understudied indigenous minority Austronesian language spoken in the southern Philippines. While Philippine languages are often taken as prototype examples of symmetrical voice languages, most research has focused on just of a few of the larger languages, such as Tagalog, ignoring the diversity which exists within Greater Central Philippines, a family of nearly one hundred languages. Subanon is unique in distinguishing multiple forms of active voice, the marking of which interacts in complex ways with number, tense, and mood. In order to better understand the factors motivating choice of voice the CoPI will compile a comprehensive collection of recordings of natural language use. These recordings will form the basis for a grammatical description of voice, while also serving the needs of researchers working on related grammatical topics.  Given the lack of existing documentation of Subanon, the description of symmetrical voice will be embedded within a reference grammar, thus ensuring that this work is maximally accessible to other researchers. Moreover, in order to better understand the factors motivating choice of voice forms this research will compile a corpus of annotated recordings of natural language, which will be archived and accessible for both researchers and community members. The outcomes of this project will thus provide new data on a little-studied Philippine language while also informing ongoing debates about the nature of symmetrical voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The brain is the only known controller capable of moving a 5-fingered robot with high precision to use a wide variety of tools and objects. While we know a lot about the control signals in the brain and movement of the fingers, we do not have a good idea of how one gives rise to the other. Here, we will generate an enormous dataset, which will be publicly distributed to students and other scientists everywhere. It will include many channels of brain activity simultaneously with muscle activity to help work out the transformation between the two, and attempt to replicate this control system using artificial neural networks. A strong demonstration of brain controlled prostheses could lead to human studies, and a clinical system that could impact the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people with amputations or paralysis, as well generating insights for smarter robotic systems. Beyond the direct output of the research, brain machine interfaces have the capability to inspire a large number of students, including those from underrepresented groups, into careers in science and technology, by showing clearly to a young audience how this kind of education can help people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to record data simultaneously from the brain, muscles, and kinematics of the primate hand during complex finger movements, in order to replicate this control system. Specifically, the objective of this particular application is to establish the first such dataset in a nonhuman primate, recording 200 channels from motor cortex, 12 channels of EMG from the muscles, and precise kinematics during the acquisition of finger targets from 4 different degrees of freedom.  Our central hypothesis is that firing rates can be transformed to EMG using a single layer neural nonlinearity followed by a regularized linear regression, and then transformed into finger kinematics through non-linear but well-characterized anatomy.  This differs from upper limb signals, which can appear to be linearly modulated by endpoint velocity regardless of posture. We will complete this project with three objectives. In Objective 1, we will establish a world-class surgical team to create a nonhuman primate animal model with simultaneous chronic brain recording and EMG recording. In Objective 2, we will develop an algorithmic approach to map motor cortex firing rates to EMG as well as kinematics, with both offline and online testing. In Objective 3, we will explore low power circuitry to extract this information in real time, at a power consumption that would be appropriate for an implantable medical device. The overall scientific philosophy of this project is that the brain provides an example of a low power neural network, which is relatively shallow between motor cortex and EMG, for controlling a complex soft robotic system. Uncovering this relationship will enable us to use this approach for brain machine interfaces for paralysis as well as guiding future human made robotic approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The research will focus on Native American populations who are historically understudied yet experience high levels of stress-related disparities. Stress physiology will be assessed using various biomarkers, including salivary cortisol, blood pressure (BP), and additional biometric data. Semi-structured interviews, demographic questionnaires, psychometric measures, and identity scales will be used to assess how cultural identity, psychosocial stress, historical trauma, health status and stress physiology interact. The results of this research will advance understanding of how seemingly unrelated psychological mechanisms and social environments may contribute to disparities in physiological well-being among minority populations in the United States. The project will also support student training and science outreach activities, including among groups underrepresented in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the relationship between psychosocial stress, stress physiology, and physiological disparities by assessing: 1: the prevalence of diagnosed and suspected stress-related conditions in an Indigenous Community in the Pacific Northwest (ICPN); 2: allostatic load (chronic stress) in members of ICPN, as defined by an Allostatic Load Index (ALI) comprising neuroendocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune system biomarkers; and 3: the relationship between variation in HPA-axis regulation (stress physiology) and allostatic load, and stress-related disease occurrence, Indigenous ancestry, historical trauma, and cultural identity in ICPN.

Yet there is an empirical and theoretical gap in our understanding of the individual-level processes underpinning leadership and the group-level consequences of leadership. How does the cognition of individual leaders translate into coordinated group action in the real world?  This project proposes using chimpanzees as a new model of human-like leadership to better understand the evolutionary origins of our own leadership patterns. We will bridge the gap between individual- and group-level phenomena by conducting matched research with semi-free ranging chimpanzees living in a sanctuary where we can do detailed assessments of cognition, and with chimpanzees living in the wild where we can look at complex group behavior in a natural setting. By matching datasets across these two contexts, we will be able to see how individual cognitive process translate into group action. While humans are thought to be uniquely able to establish leadership through prestige and collaboration instead of just pure physical domination, chimpanzees are our closest living relative, also show variation in how individuals obtain and maintain status in their groups. This project will therefore illuminate the evolutionary origins of human leadership, and also set a new agenda in evolutionary cognitive science for studying cognition in the wild. Training, education, and outreach from elementary school through to graduate school will be integrated throughout the project both domestically and abroad. As part of this proposal, we will develop a leadership module for children, using animal models to demonstrate different forms of leadership. We will implement this module through outreach at local schools and museums in the US and in 16 primary schools in Uganda. Undergraduates and high school students in the US will gain hand-on research experience through internships and in coursework. Two postdoctoral researchers and a graduate student will further gain international research experiences in the course of the project. This integrated approach to research and education will train a new generation of evolutionary cognitive scientists and disseminate primate research to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify individual leaders (those with outsized influence) in natural social groups across multiple contexts of behavior including dominance rank, initiation of group movements, resource acquisition, within-group mediation and inter-group aggression. The second aim is to create leadership profiles by characterizing individual variation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms of leaders across these contexts. At the sanctuary, 100+ chimpanzees across 5 social groups will be assayed for cognition (including social cognition, cooperation, and executive function); temperament; behavior (aggression and affiliation), and physiology (hormones and body size) to predict leadership. At the field site, similar assessments will be made of temperament, behavior, and physiology, drawing on a longitudinal database with 30 years of data on 150 wild chimpanzees. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that there are distinct pathways to leadership in chimpanzees, with intimidation-based and cooperative strategies being the most important, but knowledge and motivation anchoring some forms of leadership. The final aim is to understand how variation in leadership styles shapes the outcomes of collective action by examining several short-and long-term metrics of leadership success, including group cohesion, rewards received, and biological outcomes like reproductive success that can only be studied in the wild. This project will bridge individual-level and group-level perspectives on cognition, behavior, and physiology by leveraging the strengths of two natural populations of chimpanzees. The project will match experimental and observational techniques across sites on a scale never previously done, and will develop chimpanzees as a new model for human leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The research team will further investigate individual variability in these mechanisms and test whether they have predictive power for personality traits that lie on a continuum with mental illnesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs a robust, dramatic perceptual paradigm to shed light on how past experiences shape current perceptual processing. Combining psychophysics with cutting-edge human brain imaging technologies, this project will dissect the neural mechanisms underlying the influence of prior experience on human visual perception at the levels of local processing within a brain region, inter-areal information transmission, and large-scale brain dynamics. Further, the extent to which perception relies on prior knowledge varies across healthy individuals and psychiatric patients. This project will capitalize on variations in the general population to determine which neural mechanisms drive individual variability in the reliance of perception on prior knowledge, and further test whether such neural mechanisms can predict an individual?s propensity to psychosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

In order to understand the underlying changes in brain development, there is a dire need to develop innovative tools that can measure neurotransmitter levels in real-time during complex social interactions among two or more animals. In this project, the research team will design, implement and test novel integrated biosensor microprobes that will simultaneously record two key brain neurotransmitters (L-glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, and Gamma Aminobutyric Acid [GABA], an inhibitory neurotransmitter) in real time during complex social interactions using this vole model of autism. The biosensor system will be made wireless and will also be combined with electroencephalography (EEG), as a measure of brain electrical activity. This highly collaborative project advances neuroengineering by developing a much-needed method to measure Excitation:Inhibition (E:I) balance in the brain in real-time, which will inform fundamental questions about the brain control of social interactions in healthy and autistic individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific tasks of this study are as follows: Task 1) Develop and test wired, enzyme-based flexible integrated dual-sensor probes to assess L-glutamate and GABA levels in prairie voles in order to examine E:I balance in the brain during complex social interactions. Task 2) Develop and test a wireless system with an integrated L-glutamate and GABA flexible dual-sensor probe to study changes in the E:I balance the brain during complex social interactions. Task 3) Develop and test a wireless dual sensor probe integrated with EEG as a way to investigate effects of ELSD on EEG gamma oscillations as a functional readout of E:I balance during complex social interactions. The microprobes and systems developed in this project can be generalized to other studies of neurological disorders using rodents or larger animal models. The outcomes would help reveal how neural processes may go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as enable the next generation of neural prostheses, therapeutics and brain machine interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, we don't fully understand the effects of aging on apes in the wild or which aspects of human longevity are unique. This doctoral research project will investigate how wild male chimpanzees age physiologically and behaviorally with a focus on how aging impacts foraging ability, which may reveal how frailty impacts fitness. The findings will help clarify whether chimpanzees' feeding behavior and performance change with age, and whether foraging could play an important role in shaping their patterns of senescence. This research will fill gaps in our knowledge on the senescence of male primate skeletal biology and may help to clarify whether fertility maintained late in life contributes to the evolution of extended lifespan. The investigators will engage in educational activities in the United States and near the research site in rural Uganda, and foster international research collaborations and capacity building. In addition, the continued presence of researchers in Kibale National Park helps protect one of the last tropical rainforests in all of East Africa, which is notably one of the principal strongholds of chimpanzees in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will investigate aging in male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. The investigators will assess the physiological traits of adult male chimpanzees at various ages to assess how bone density, body mass, chewing ability, and energetic status may decrease in old age. To this end, the research will non-invasively collect and analyze fecal samples to assess chewing efficiency as well as urine samples to measure insulin biomarkers (an indicator of energetic status) and collagen biomarkers to investigate decreases in bone density. Behavioral observations will also be carried out to assess how these physical changes may impact movement, food selection, ingestion rates, mating effort, and sociality.

In ancient urban studies, researchers often focus on the movement of large aggregate groups of people to a region during the city's initial settlement and the ultimate cause(s) of demographic collapse. While these events are crucial to understanding how ancient urban centers first arose and were eventually abandoned, more attention needs to be paid to how large populations were sustained for long periods of time, some spanning hundreds of years. This research will focus on how immigration in an urban setting contributed to these maintenance efforts. Recent advances in archaeology allow researchers to identify individual and group-level migration across time rather than observing the movement of ancient people as a large, singular event. This doctoral dissertation study will be one of the first to explore the impact of migration over time on population maintenance in a pre-modern city and provide a direct comparison of migrants between multiple tiers of status groups (lower-, middle-, and higher-status producers and consumers). Doctoral student Gina M. Buckley, under the direction of Kenneth G. Hirth, will conduct research at Penn State University. This research will foster international collaboration with Mexico (INAH), Canada (Western University Ontario) and Europe (Max Planck, Jena, Germany) and the development of outreach communication to promote the acceptance of migrant communities. Furthermore, all data obtained through this research will be made available on an open-access platform to support future population studies in pre-modern cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation research project will explore the migration patterns of socioeconomic status groups from La Ventilla, a central neighborhood of Teotihuacan (located near present-day Mexico City), the first multi-ethnic New World city to reach over 100,000 residents (200-600 AD). While it is well chronicled that immigration from the surrounding region fueled much of the city's initial growth, it remains unclear when multi-ethnicity developed here, particularly in the central sectors. Research will test two hypotheses; (1) migration into the heart of Teotihuacan was a continuous process over the entire occupation of this city sector, rather than occurring primarily during its foundation, and (2) larger proportions of lower-status individuals migrated into the center of the city and have significant differences in ""quality of life"" indicators (skeletal markers of health, age-at-death estimations, and diet) than those of higher status groups. Previous studies of the city population have shown that individuals towards the fringes of the city suffered from common pre-modern problems including malnutrition and high infant mortality rates. Using a broad spectrum of isotopic analyses (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium, and lead) combined with absolute chronological control through radiocarbon dating of human skeletal remains, researchers will determine if immigration was critical to population maintenance for over 400 years of occupation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

When such systems are coupled with automation that supports and guides performance, they offer tremendous opportunities for American companies, but also might create challenges for their workers. Optical, see-through displays from wearable devices like smart glasses or head-mounted displays can project images while still allowing the user to see through them. The resulting blend of digital elements with the person's view of the real world is a form of augmented reality. This type of dynamic integration of new forms of information with our environment provides an opportunity to enable major innovations in the workplace. However, the ability to use these devices to constantly and seamlessly inform and guide people as they perform their jobs will impact what these individuals are learning. A key issue is how people can remain engaged in the tasks in ways that allow them to learn what is necessary for them to enhance performance and outcomes and also enrich their working lives. What people need to avoid is becoming passive, unquestioning recipients of external support. This research tackles the issue of how to optimize support and assistance to increase human capacities and improve immediate outcomes, while still allowing the durable, robust learning that ultimately produces skilled, experienced workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core objective of this award is to advance the use of automation support for performance in future work by incorporating principles from the science of learning to produce superior long-term outcomes. This approach will provide a foundation for determining when and how external assistance would provide the best aid to humans. The work aims towards a new theoretical framework, as well as for  guidelines for practitioners and developers.

Even after securing employment, people with disabilities often face misunderstandings or negative attitudes from their coworkers. This impacts their ability to be productive and to learn the skills required for their profession. This project is situated in mixed-ability workplaces (i.e., settings in which workers without disabilities and workers with different types of disabilities collaborate). The researchers will explore challenges that emerge during training sessions and everyday work. They will then investigate how theories that connect cognition with physical action can be used to design novel technologies that augment the level of accessibility of mixed-ability workplaces and the success of all workers. The goal of this planning project is to build research capacity for generating fundamental, convergent research in support of mixed-ability workplaces and ultimately to boost the diversity of the U.S. workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three major thrusts.

For all spoken languages, part of this knowledge includes how the speech organs, including the lips, tongue, and velum, are coordinated in time to produce speech. Additionally, many languages also distinguish words from each other using different pitch patterns, called tones. This project investigates whether tones interact with the coordination of other speech organs, drawing together several types of data from the understudied Tibetan language. Methodologically, the project integrates experimental measurements on the physical movement of articulators with audio data gathered in Nepal, harnessing the variation found between speakers in the diaspora Tibetan community to understand basic principles of how tones, consonants and vowels are coordinated in time. Broader impacts include the publicly available deposit of audio recordings to enable future work by linguists and community members, capturing a snapshot of a language undergoing rapid change.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Co-PI, a doctoral student at Yale University, will analyze acoustic and articulatory data of Tibetan as spoken in its diaspora, an understudied language with significant variation between speakers. One aspect of the variation is that some speakers have retained tone while others speakers have lost tone contrasts. The main hypothesis is that the presence of lexical tone alters the coordination of articulatory gestures, with articulatory and acoustic consequences resulting from the balance of competing demands of laryngeal and supralaryngeal aspects of speech production. This study extends analysis of acoustic data collected by the co-PI in Nepal to a corpus of spontaneous speech. The corpus analysis is crucially informed by an experiment on the articulatory kinematics of Tibetan. The experiment uses electromagnetic articulography (EMA) to track the movement of the tongue and lips together with acoustic recordings. Besides providing a test of the main hypothesis in laboratory speech, analysis of co-registered acoustic and kinematic signals will establish acoustic measures of relative timing that can be used in the corpus analysis. The corpus study will evaluate hypotheses in naturalistic speech data, allow consideration of a wider range of factors influencing timing, further assess variability within and across speakers, and provide a valuable resource for future research. This project will contribute to scientific understanding of the mental representation of tone and the timing relations among oral, laryngeal, and tonal gestures, combine corpus and articulatory methods, draw evidence from variation, and advance research on a less-studied language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Though many primates are known from this time period, their paleobiology and evolutionary relationships are not well understood. This project will investigate the extent of paleontological and geological data from a potentially early Miocene site - Napenagila South - in West Turkana, Kenya. The site was unexpectedly discovered in 2018 when primate teeth and an abundance of fauna were found. Preliminary observations of the teeth suggest that they may belong to a previously unknown extinct ape species. Systematic data collection and analysis will be used to confirm preliminary geological observations, and the researchers will excavate the area where the primate teeth were found. Training, mentorship, and research opportunities in the field and laboratory will be extended to students, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM. The project also will foster and expand international collaborations with Kenyan researchers and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will conduct fieldwork at Napenagila South and perform subsequent lab analyses in order to determine the extent of the sediments and conduct a detailed assessment of the site's geological context, obtain additional samples to more precisely constrain the site's dates, and collect and conduct analyses of primate and other mammalian fossils. Local stratigraphic sequences will be measured, described, and sampled in detail. Laboratory characterization of the sediments, along with separation of mineral phases for isotopic dating, will be undertaken at Rutgers University.

Export-oriented mass production is often associated with modern western economies, but similar production systems had already developed prior to the modern era. So far, little attention has been paid to examine how large-scale production was organized at the local level to meet the global demands in the premodern period. Archaeology is uniquely suited to provide relevant insight because it can examine the production activities that were rarely mentioned in historical texts and trace their development through a long-time perspective. By focusing on the large-scale, non-elite production that is not often investigated by archaeologists, this research will add a new dimension to understanding of ancient craft production systems. This research will also provide empirical evidence for studying non-western economic systems that are less frequently addressed in the discussion of ancient economy, thereby contributing to the comparative study of ancient economies across the pre-industrial world. This project will provide essential research training for the doctoral candidate and foster closer academic collaboration between several institutes in the U.S. and China, including the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Field Museum, the Fujian Museum, the Dehua Ceramic Museum, and Peking University. Results from this project will form the basis of one Ph.D. dissertation as well as multiple conference papers and academic publications in both English and Chinese. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xu and his research team will examine the structure and dynamics of production networks as a means of understanding the organization of the large-scale, nonelite production system that feeds into the global trade networks in the premodern period. The research will take place at Dehua in southeast China, where dozens of huge dragon kilns formed an industrial district and mass-produced porcelain products exclusively for export under the Song and Yuan dynasties (960-1368 CE). The researchers will adopt a GIS-based social network analysis approach to study the production networks in the porcelain industry at Dehua. Archaeological information needed to document the inter-kiln similarities will be collected through a multidisciplinary program, including systematic surveys of kiln sites, stylistic analysis of kiln furniture, and compositional analysis (pXRF and LA-ICP-MS) of ceramic products. This project will serve as a pioneer study of investigating the large-scale porcelain production on a regional scale. The innovative approaches used in this project will help build a methodological framework that can be used for other production centers in the past.

During this period, Native American populations in the continental US were affected by expanding trade networks, a growing reliance on agriculture, increasingly permanent settlements, and population growth. After AD 1492, European contact led to significant cultural changes as well as disease epidemics, demographic collapse, population restructuring, and genetic exchange with new tribes and non-native peoples. These developments are well documented, but it is not known how they influenced the genetic makeup of Native American populations. By characterizing genetic diversity, this project will help elucidate the genetic structure and evolutionary history of Native North Americans, improve our understanding of how sociocultural, demographic, and evolutionary change influences the human genome, and fill a critical need for genome-wide data from the indigenous inhabitants of the continental US, who have been underrepresented in scientific research and public genetic databases.  The project provides research experience and training for undergraduates, graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and a K-12 public school science teacher.  Educational modules are also being developed for high school and college science courses and for the Summer Internship for Native Americans in Genomics (SING).  This project therefore advances scientific knowledge, expands the participation of underrepresented groups in science, improves science education, and increases public engagement with science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project is evaluating temporal and spatial patterns of genetic diversity in the Midwestern US using existing datasets from the region and new genetic data being collected from three burial populations in the Ohio River Basin.  The three major goals are: (1) characterize genomic diversity across time and space in the Ohio River Basin, (2) reconstruct the maternal population history of the Midwestern US using spatially and temporally diverse samples from the Ohio River Basin and the Illinois River Valley, and (3) evaluate whether sociocultural and evolutionary changes between 1000 and 1700 AD altered the genomic structure of an ancient population in the Ohio River Basin. To achieve these goals, genomic data will be collected using newly developed target capture and next-generation sequencing technologies. An extensive set of genomic markers (genome-wide SNPs, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and 23 Y chromosome STRs) will be analyzed, which will make it possible to test hypotheses about how post-1000 AD migration, genetic drift, and selection altered the genetic structure of Native Americans.

In the globalized world today, many of cities and neighborhoods are vibrantly multiethnic, yet socially diverse communities are largely considered a fact of large, well-organized societies. Nevertheless, there is enough evidence for cases of multiethnic diversity in smaller, less-centralized societies to challenge this relationship and to question how groups of different levels of political complexity were able to effectively negotiate multiethnic coexistence. Archaeology is uniquely suited to address the long-term development of multiethnic societies, how they were ordered, and what sort of institutions were used to mitigate divisive and destructive forces which often plague inter-ethnic relations. In particular, by collecting data across periods when state-control was either suspended or in full-swing, this research will provide insights regarding the role of multi-ethnicity in a variety of political contexts, helping us better understand how different approaches to multiethnic coexistence may encourage stability or instead lead to hostility and conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research has highlighted the political, often hostile nature of inter-ethnic interactions and the need for centralized judicial mechanisms for groups with diverse identities to peacefully live alongside one another. In this regard, states are considered uniquely suited to deal with inter-ethnic animosities through structural hierarchies and state-sponsored infrastructure which can control, channel, or suppress ongoing competition between ethnic groups, allowing different groups to live amongst one another as neighbors within the same city or in adjacent settlements. Alternatively, non-state societies are considered ill-equipped to manage inter-ethnic animosities, leading groups to instead live in exclusive, spatially segregated territories where inter-group conflict is an omnipresent threat. Under the direction of Dr. Elizabeth Arkush of the University of Pittsburgh, doctoral candidate Ryan Smith will conduct full coverage pedestrian survey, intensive site mapping, and a program of systematic surface collections near the Lake Titicaca basin of southern Peru to understand changes in the ethnic landscape directly before and after the arrival of the Inca state in the area (AD 1000-1530). These investigations are specifically centered on an important transition zone between the high plains around Lake Titicaca and the eastern Andean piedmont, forming what has been described as a 'multiethnic frontier' where ethnic groups coexisted alongside one another under Inca control, if not earlier. This research will first test the hypothesis that state-level political organization was necessary for multiethnic coexistence, investigating whether multiethnicity appears prior to or after the arrival of the Inca state. Survey data will also allow researchers to test how multiethnicity was effectively ordered through addressing what institutions, organizational forms, or spatial frameworks were enacted and how these approaches to inter-group interaction differed between state and non-state societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The urban areas in this region, intersected by rural areas, share a common environmental settling and history of natural resource exploitation, followed by industrialization, then de-industrialization and little to no population growth. Environmental variability and the need to prepare for and adapt to its impacts pose a new challenge to the urban systems essential to the region's sustainable development. The region is not anticipated to be as severely impacted by environmental change as other parts of the U.S. and might become a corridor of relative stability possible resulting in in-migration and increased economic activities while renewing pressure on natural resources, thus challenging sustainability. The region's urban and rural systems require a holistic assessment of current and future sustainability stressors. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the creation of a network to develop scholarly research and interdisciplinary communication with stakeholders to provide the foundation for a sustainable and resilient strategy on urban systems. The broader social impact of the project will be realized through the resulting coordination and collaboration in the realm of sustainability that will enhance the region's essential infrastructure and quality of life, help safeguard public health, and contribute to economic competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against the backdrop of a growing appreciation among scholars and stakeholders of the sustainability challenges arising from the differential environmental variability, the scientific focus of the project will be on the development of new insights and approaches to supporting new sustainable development modes of urban systems. The objective in organizing and hosting a three day OUTSTEP-LGL conference is to provide a scientific foundation for a sustainability strategy on urban systems for the LGL region by bringing together sustainability and resilience scholars from across academic disciplines and stakeholders.

A crowded urban planet must determine how to move people through cities and provide access to opportunities in an environmentally-friendly, socially-just and economically efficient manner.  Both due to these concerns and the availability of new communication and location-aware technologies, we are witnessing the introduction of disruptive mobility services in many communities.  However, this is often happening in an ad-hoc, bottom-up manner: examples include ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, dockless bike-sharing and scooters. Consequently, researchers, public officials and other stakeholders are struggling to keep up with these innovations and understand their potential impacts on equity, the environment and economic performance. Thankfully, these new mobility technologies generate a large amount of ""digital exhaust:"" incidental data that is a byproduct of their use.  Also, urban processes are increasingly digitized, urban environments are increasingly sensed, and people contribute to this urban data maelstrom through social media and citizen science.  We can leverage these new data sources to understand the impacts of new mobility technologies and services on urban sustainability.  We will conduct a two-day interactive workshop in Columbus, Ohio in July 2019 to engage community-based stakeholders and a diverse group of researchers in a facilitated dialogue on how to use these data to generate transformative urban sustainability science and actionable knowledge for evidence-based policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on the opportunities and challenges of building and maintaining an urban sustainability data observatory (USDO): technological and organizational system for persistent collection, cleaning, fusing, analysis and sharing of urban data.  A USDO can enable new measures and analyses of progress towards sustainability over time.  It can also leverage real-world events to develop retrospective and prospective natural and quasi-experimental designs that provide stronger support for causality than cross-sectional designs. The workshop will focus on two specific cities in which USDOs are currently being planned and are also experiencing the introduction of disruptive mobility technologies and services, Columbus, Ohio and Portland, Oregon. In addition, the workshop will seek to develop a convergent sustainable urban systems (SUS) framework that can support the development of a network of urban sustainability data observatories and lay the foundation for a new kind of data-driven, comparative observatory science guided by SUS theories of change.

Many inhabitants of this enormous territory have been sustained for thousands of years by herding sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The animal herds must be moved continually to fresh pastures in a pattern that often precludes the establishment of permanent residences. The relationship of such subsistence systems to sedentary agriculture or to highly mobile foraging for wild resources is poorly understood. The possibility that specialized herding may have developed directly from mobile foraging rather than as an adaptation complementary to sedentary farming is especially interesting and little investigated. Under the supervision of Dr. Robert Drennan and Dr. Loukas Barton, Jennifer Farquhar will investigate the role of hunter-gatherers in the development of mobile pastoralism in the desert-steppe region of Mongolia. The study focuses on patterns of mobility across the entire economic and social transition from small-scale egalitarian societies some 7000 years ago to the more complex larger-scale sociopolitical integration of the Bronze Age some 2500 years ago. Mobility is critical to both foraging and herding modes of production. Its study provides not only important insight into how settlement strategies changed with the addition of domestic animals, but also puts in context other aspects of social life including patterns of social interaction, hierarchy, and differential access to material wealth, prestige, production, and ritual. Models from evolutionary ecology will be used in the effort to understand better how hunters and, later on, herders distributed themselves within habitats, identifying changes in how, when, and why people moved. The evaluation of these models will contribute to our understanding of the nature of human decision making as well as of the mechanisms of behavioral change. Application of these models over the past two decades has led to advances in understanding a range of phenomena including the origins of agriculture and the emergence of institutional inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Farquhar will carry out systematic regional-scale survey in the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in southeastern Mongolia to identify locations where the ephemeral remains of highly mobile hunters and herders can be found, and to collect samples of these materials for study. The research is a central part of Ms. Farquhar's doctoral training and will provide field training and experience for both U.S. and Mongolian students. Cooperation among US and Mongolian team members in field work, laboratory analysis, and interpretation will encourage the exchange of people, ideas, and information in order to promote outcomes that reflect the goals and values of all participants. A collaborative approach to public outreach to local herding communities and the large urban center of Ulaanbaatar will contribute to the goals of Ikh Nart Nature Reserve and the national government to promote environmental management and resource conservation, topics of particular concern in light of recent declines in both natural and cultural resources in the face of unprecedented extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The most impactful of these organisms was the domestic cow, the raising of which dramatically changed landscapes, animal management, and interactions among people. The biological consequence of the European colonialism, and in particular the introduction of cattle, constitutes a major event of human history that definitively shaped the modern world. In this study, archaeological remains of colonial period cattle are analyzed to better understand the effects of this introduction not only on the cattle themselves, but also on the development of the diverse colonial societies of Mesoamerica and the Caribbean during the two first centuries of Spanish rule. Archaeology, and more particularly zooarchaeology is particularly well placed to explore this topic because it provides a direct analysis of the fine-grained processes that affected the animals' biology and behavior but also how their management affected human social systems. Archaeological remains from five early colonial sites from Mexico, Guatemala, and Haiti, dating between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, will be studied to identify the geographic origins of the animals (ancient DNA), their morphological diversity (skeletal morphometrics), and their demographic and health structure (age/sex and pathologies of the individuals within each population). Together these lines of evidence will provide an image of how the first colonists brought, traded and exchanged these animals. Cattle raising represented, and still represents in many regions of the Americas including the US, a crucial aspect of culture and economics. Studying the first steps of the implementation of cattle raising will shed a new light on the pivotal role played by domestic animals such as cattle in the early colonization of the Americas. This project is also a methodological contribution to the field by constituting the first use of combined archaeological genomics and morphological traits to document the history trajectory of colonial faunas in the Americas. Collaborations among US, Mexican and Guatemalan researchers, as well as lectures and museum exhibits will provide information and encourage discussion among the international audience of archaeologists, biologists, and cattle-owners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the question of how the transplantation and exploitation of cattle transformed both cattle and human populations in the Caribbean and Mesoamerica during the early Spanish colonial period, the research project will use three methodological approaches: (1) extraction and sequencing of ancient DNA from archaeological cow remains will clarify the origins and phylogeographic history of New World colonial cattle. (2) Geometric morphometric (GMM) data will define the regional and temporal variability of cow molar shape as a proxy for cattle morphotype diversity. These two lines of evidence will reveal the composition of the original populations of Spanish colonial cattle, highlight whether the animals were brought from Europe or Africa, and clarify the chronology of these introductions across the study region. (3) Finally, zooarchaeological markers of age and sex will document cattle herd demographics, and paleopathological indicators of health will illustrate the impact of diverse cattle husbandry practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Doctoral dissertation researcher Lorraine Hu will study early processes of social differentiation among herding groups by examining localized variability in burial customs. Previous scholarship on the spread of nomadic societies to this region has emphasized economy and subsistence, focusing on the aspects of daily life that make pastoralism distinct from sedentary or hunter-gatherer lifeways. Other cultural practices, though more difficult to trace in deep time, are equally important to understanding how groups create and negotiate fluid social landscapes. Archaeology is well-equipped to provide insight into questions of social variability by tracing changes in local customs over the long term. Understanding how communities choose to define their own identities through maintaining or changing traditions has relevance for many herding groups today, where processes of globalization complicate boundaries of both identity and subsistence. The project will build partnerships through providing training opportunities for Kenyan students and promote cultural heritage education in East Africa and the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Fiona Marshall and Lorraine Hu of Washington University in St. Louis will examine the development of funerary practices of early pastoralist groups in East Africa. The research will be conducted in southern Kenya where a tradition of cremation, unique to the area, developed between 3000-1000 years ago when herders first migrated into the highlands. These early pastoralists are known to have developed distinct lithic and ceramic traditions, but social variability across communities is yet unknown. Research on funerary customs aims to elucidate localized differences. By combining excavation, sedimentological sampling and study of skeletal material from previously excavated cremation sites, the researchers will reconstruct cremation burial practices from different sites. Integrated sediment and skeletal analyses allow detailed study of pyrotechnic processes, and in conjunction provide a new approach to mortuary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

However, research has identified a particular phonological proxy that appears to violate the general principles by which these proxies encode speech. This proxy occurs in the Abu' Arapesh [ISO 639-3 aah] language and the modalities used by Abu' speakers to communicate across distance, which include whistling, blowing conch shells, calling out, and playing flutes. This project will document and describe these linguistically novel Abu'  proxies, used only in the Prince Alexander Mountains of Papua New Guinea, which may hold key insights into the nature of human language. The knowledge sharing between the United States and Papua New Guinea, identified by the U.S. State Department as a bilateral close friendship, will continue to be strengthened via the ties this project builds between the University of Virginia (UVA) and the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG). The project will also undertake community development at the research site via small projects and hands-on training with electronic devices, computer programs, and basic principles of science, as well as support for students at UPNG, effecting ""soft diplomacy"" through scientific collaboration. Broader impacts also include the training of a dissertation student, the education of undergraduate students in a university course to be taught by the researcher, and the public archiving of fully transcribed recordings at UVA's Arapesh Grammar and Digital Language Archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One aspect of the scientific importance of this study is the surprisingly sparse phonological resources used in the proxy forms of Abu': two pitches, two vowels, two consonants, and rhythm. Another aspect is its use not only by Abu' speakers but also by speakers of a neighboring, mutually unintelligible language Miya [ISO 639-3 wmo]. This is doubly surprising, as both languages are endangered and, according to global trends of language loss, phonological proxies should be at even higher risk than spoken language. Yet the proxies persist, even in the face of recently introduced cell phones, which could easily supplant their role facilitating long distance communication. This project asks: how do the Abu' proxies encode speech? What is their linguistic role, such that they persist? To answer, the researcher will spend eight months in the community in which Abu' proxies are still used, and visit neighboring communities where Miya is used, producing an audiovisual corpus of interviews, language lessons, word elicitations, and recordings of daily life. Recordings will be transcribed with the help of native speakers to achieve fine-grained linguistic analysis. The resulting case study of linguistic resilience will contribute valuable information to endeavors to ameliorate global language loss, and the resulting description of the structure of the proxies as they relate to Abu', with supporting evidence from Miya, will contribute valuable information to the study of human language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Self-regulation relies on an individual's ability to fluidly maintain balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The primary nerve involved in signaling between systems is the vagus nerve.  The efficacy of the vagus nerve, called ""vagal tone"" has been associated with the ability to maintain appropriate balance between systems. Children who grow up in compromised circumstances, including maternal malnutrition or stress and early trauma or malnutrition often have poor vagal tone at the outset, placing them at a biological disadvantage when they enter the classroom setting. A multi-disciplinary team will converge on design and practices for creating technology and algorithms to better assess vagal tone and the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Best practices for conducting continuous collection of simultaneous behavioral and physiological data from multiple children in a natural classroom setting will be addressed as will analysis of the resultant data from both dynamical systems and information theory perspectives. This undertaking should reveal the association of vagal regulation of the nervous system and a child's ability to regulate their cognitive state for classroom learning in a natural social setting. The creation of cyberinfrastructure and tools for collaboration and creation will support the project, training of future scientists, and the scalability of the project. The discovery of clear patterns of data will allow future efforts to address equity in learning by devising ways to facilitate development of vagal tone and/or the ability to regulate the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in those for whom it is compromised at the outset. Data analytics might also reveal recommendations for optimizing the classroom setting to facilitate early self-regulation and learning. Partnerships will allow the broader dissemination of the research findings for inclusion in teacher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a biological perspective, the ability to self-regulate is dealt with through the balance of the brain and bodily systems by effectively balancing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The primary perpetrator responsible for maintaining this balance is thought to be the vagus nerve, and its efficacy can be approximated through a variety of heart rate and respiration rate comparisons often referred to as vagal tone. Compromised maternal environment, poor nutrition, or early trauma are amongst the conditions that can lead to early developmental differences in vagal tone, posing the question of equity as it relates to the development of regulatory function. This multidisciplinary team led by Dr. Chiba will investigate the role of vagal tone in classroom self-regulation and learning, through convergent scientific approaches that includes development and augmentation of nano-sensor technology to achieve high quality, unobtrusive measurements of vagal tone, and new algorithms for measurement during testing and learning experiences in the classroom. The sensor network will be supported by the development of classroom mapping and cyberinfrastructure for large-scale, real-time data collection and predictive modeling. To scaffold the gap between laboratory hypotheses and contextually-based evidence, an embedded network of sensors for studying physiology as it relates to self-regulatory skills (e.g., executive functions) in the classroom will be developed. Analytics to measure vagal tone across time will enable understanding of the variability in vagal tone and how it relates to concurrent measures of classroom self-regulation. Once conclusions from resultant data are considered to be scientifically reliable,  information will be disseminated in a form that is useful for educators. To support the interdisciplinary efforts, this project also includes development of cyberinfrastructure to support convergence research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Place of residence after marriage, or postmarital residence, impacts the structure of societies and their kinship networks. Ralston's dissertation research will investigate the relationship between the relative importance of male versus female contributions to subsistence and diet, and postmarital residence. Advancements in stable isotope analysis of human skeletal tissues, permit archaeologists to generate nuanced data-sets with which to investigate ancient diet and mobility. Stable isotope analysis provides more direct evidence of paleomigration and diet for individuals, can distinguish individual-level residential and dietary patterns, and permit comparison between male- and female-mobility and dietary patterns. This study uses five isotopic discriminants (strontium, oxygen, sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen). Incorporating multiple lines of isotopic evidence enhances the interpretive power of these analyses for understanding human mobility and the food webs they exploit. This project will also further Ralston's academic and intellectual development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evidence will come from two California Central Valley archaeological sites, CA-SAC-107 and CA-SJO-68, dating to the Early Period (ca. 5000-2500 BP).  The California archaeological record shows temporal trends for 1) shifting subsistence-economies and 2) increasing differentiation of gendered labor. As such, the region is ideal to test how subsistence and labor co-vary with postmarital residence. Archaeological research conducted in California's Central Valley has traditionally focused on resource intensification, demographic forcing, and resource depression as drivers of cultural change. By contrast, the dynamics of cultural development and social organization have not been adequately addressed. Cross-cultural analyses suggest that economic systems, the division of labor between women and men, warfare, and territoriality are significant predictors of postmarital residence practices. These findings set up the central question of Ralston's research. Does the division of labor, and more specifically, a biased subsistence contribution to the overall diet, influence postmarital residence for Early Period populations in the Central Valley of California? Ralston will address the research question by 1) reconstructing marital mobility using isotope chemistry (strontium, oxygen, and sulfur) in skeletal tissues to ascertain postmarital residence, 2) interpreting subsistence practices using previously published faunal, botanical, and artifactual data from CA-SAC-107 and CA-SJO-68, and 3) reconstructing the diet of burial populations from the two sites using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen, and carbon in bioapatite. Ralston's dissertation research will clarify synchronic patterns of postmarital residence for the Early Period but also, when combined with site-specific data from different periods, provide a diachronic perspective that will elucidate the evolution of postmarital residence practices of indigenous groups of California and, more broadly, hunter-gatherers. Additionally, this study will demonstrate the significance of using multi-isotopic approaches to understanding ancient human behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Recent scientific advances have demonstrated that river dynamics and habitats vary in the downstream direction not only in smooth, gradual ways, but also in non-smooth, complex ways at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. This mosaic-like ""riverscape"" is a challenge for existing research methods monitoring how rivers change through space and time, where habitats for specific organisms are or are not connected with one another, and how rivers could be managed.  One of the data collection devices to be tested is a small automated mapping boat that can be used by volunteer watershed managers and recreational river runners creating crowd-sourced (citizen science) data to monitor and map riverscapes.  The data that will be produced using these new methods are likely to be useful to watershed managers in diverse agencies, watershed groups, and other river-related entities. By engaging with stakeholders during the design and testing phase of the automated-boat data collection phase, the investigators aim to ensure that the results will be relevant to the many people involved in making river management decisions. Additionally, the technical methods developed for this project will be designed so that they can easily be recreated and reproduced by others wishing to do similar monitoring and mapping work. The plans, software, documentation, and data will be made available via the internet using an open-source licensing framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monitoring and mapping of river environments is a task usually completed by governmental agencies, private firms, scientists, and private individuals. River monitoring achieves a variety of objectives, such as examining where and at what rate rivers are eroding adjacent property and structures, for characterizing river habitat for restoration purposes, or for evaluating water volumes and water quality. To-date these measurements are mostly done manually, one station at a time, creating a very limited spatial picture of river environments and conditions. Management of rivers is thus conducted with very little detailed knowledge of these rivers. The project's research objectives are to: (1) Develop and test a new, small, drone-boat platform capable of collecting basic longitudinal river data with minimal user interactions; (2) Compare and validate the drone boat data with expertly-collected data using a fully-outfitted research marine craft; and (3) Evaluate if it is feasible to employ a citizen science approach to monitoring and mapping of longitudinal riverscapes by deploying the drone boat within several regional test watersheds.

Characterizing the effects of warfare is a critical step towards understanding the true costs of war and helps to realize how people living in war zones cope with chronic risk. Nevertheless, it remains a substantial challenge to understand the complex relationships between warfare, economics, and health. Difficulties arise from the myriad pathways through which warfare can affect subsistence and well-being, and in-turn, how one's heath can impact their susceptibility to violence. Moreover, studies of this kind require large, longitudinal datasets, which can be difficult to obtain in modern contexts due to the dangers of working in areas with ongoing violence. Archaeology can provide critical insights into warfare by 1) focusing on the long-term impacts of violent conflict, 2) assessing warfare among small-scale societies that are more representative of humans shared evolutionary past, and 3) allowing researchers to study populations experiencing war without putting investigators or participants in harm's way. This research project will help to understand the complex ways in which people cope with conflict, and the socioecological conditions that encourage individuals to adopt risk-prone or risk-averse wartime economic strategies. Specifically, this research seeks to explain how people living in warzones proactively respond to warfare in ways that maximize the likelihood of attaining their economic and health needs while minimizing the probability of violent encounters. Further, it will evaluate why some individuals decide to maintain risky wartime economic activities that others have long abandoned. The research team will also generate novel datasets for evaluating the timing and severity of warfare in the ancient Andes, while creating educational opportunities for students that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields or labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this doctoral dissertation award NSF funding will be used to date the archaeological sites under consideration and conduct stable isotope analyses to reconstruct wartime dietary strategies and mobility. Materials used for the project include human skeletal remains excavated from the Nasca highlands of Peru from cemeteries dating to the Late Intermediate period (LIP; AD 1000-1450). Previous research conducted by the dissertation student Weston McCool and his team revealed a pattern of chronic, internecine warfare in this region during the Late Intermediate Period, defined by high rates of lethal trauma among both sexes and all age cohorts that are significantly higher than the preceding Middle Horizon period (AD 500-1000). Rates of disease also significantly increased during the LIP as revealed by high percentages of pathologies indicative of nutritional deficiencies. McCool's team will use small samples of bone from the excavated human skeletal material to evaluate each individual's stable isotope chemistry. Stable carbon isotope analysis will reveal dietary plant composition, while stable nitrogen analysis will assess how hunting and herding ""the major sources of dietary meat protein in the region"" changed during wartime. Stable oxygen isotope chemistry will be used to elucidate patterns of mobility, by evaluating whether the LIP population constrained their movement throughout the landscape during this period.

The challenges that drive and are created by large-scale migrations motivate this research into how regional and international migrant flows will change in the future and how sensitive these flows are to changing social and environmental conditions. The research team aims to achieve convergence across geography, economics, political science, environmental science, and crop sciences to better understand the causes of migration and predict future mass-migrations. Such understanding will allow society to better anticipate, adapt to, and manage such migrations to maximize human wellbeing in both source and destination countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed work, a team of researchers who are individually experts in the multiple subject areas relevant to migration will work together to transcend their disciplinary boundaries and develop a common language and methodology for understanding, analyzing, modeling and predicting migration within social, economic, and environmental contexts and their impacts on food production, security, and household livelihoods. The team will engage in intentional convergence activities where all team members together with stakeholders will work with social, economic and environmental data and models to analyze the complexity of the migration issues. This analysis will be translated into predictive models that will be calibrated and verified against historical data. The modeling effort will couple climate, crop, and global food trade models with models of household livelihoods. These will drive agent-based models of migration decisions that account for perceptions of opportunity and risk, migrant and family networks, resources, and standard economic utility maximizing models.

Meaning in Flux 2019 is a conference, unique in the world, that showcases cutting-edge empirical and experimental research at the intersection of language variation and change dynamics and how these dynamics are driven by and/or constrained by the human cognitive architecture and by the processes of language growth that take place during human early development (early childhood through adolescence).  The specific questions of the conference are: (a) to what extent are linguistic meaning and linguistic sound dynamics construable as dynamics that emerge from and are guided by real-time implementation processes? (b) how are the actuation and propagation of these dynamics driven by discourse context and other communicative constraints? By societal pressures? (c) are there causal relations between the arcs of meaning-sound acquisition/development and change?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answers to these questions have ramifications throughout society, such as the study of language impairments and developmental disabilities, and the understanding of individual differences as they impact language use in educational settings. It also has direct implications for our understanding of lesser understood speech communities, such as those connected to developmental disabilities (i.e. Autism), societally marginalized peoples (i.e. Black, LGBTQ+), and the Deaf Signing population. Such understanding will help demonstrate that these communities are all expected manifestations of the linguistic, cognitive, and social properties of humankind, which should inform the creation of fair economic, educational, and social policy. The conference also incorporates disciplines that are guiding the creation of new tools for speech technology and improved human-machine interaction.

Researchers in Polynesia have long studied chiefly society and processes of sociopolitical formation.  Previous scholarship has often focused on archaeological records of core, chiefly centers, with models highlighting elite power strategies and authority. However, more recent scholarship increasingly focuses on understanding the common, non-elite role and agency in society. By virtue of their position beyond the margins of the royal centers, even less is known about how hinterland communities conceived of authority at both the local- and regional-scales or how this conception differed from the royal centers. Given that hinterland communities are less well represented in historical literature and ethnographic documentation, archaeological approaches are well situated to augment a more spatially comprehensive record of sociopolitical formation in Hawai'i. By deploying and re-defining the concept of hinterland, this project focuses specific attention on the agency, sources of authority, and social hierarchy of Hawaiian communities at multiple scales. The study re-frames depictions of hinterland communities from zones of resource extraction to intentional communities agentively negotiating local and regional interactions. As a multi-disciplinary effort, Mr. Belluzzo will collaborate with soil scientists, paleobotanists, authorities in traditional Hawaiian knowledge systems, and State land managers to develop a holistic research study while establishing cross-disciplinary research relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research frames hinterlands as neither frontiers nor borderlands, but locations situated between multiple sources of power and authority. By moving beyond monolithic core-periphery interactions, the research will investigate non-elite Hawaiian hinterland communities in the southern Kau District of Hawai'i Island using a ""bottom-up"" approach. This will highlight how agency and local authority created interactive communities not wholly subordinate to elite centers or political cores. The research will employ a landscape-based approach to assess the traditional Hawaiian land division of Manuka, situated at the intersection of two larger political districts in an environmentally uncertain region. This region will be evaluated to identify variation in community, agency, and authority using ethnographic, environmental, ecological, and archaeological data. Nick Belluzzo and his research team will collect data through a combination of archaeological survey, archival research, and test excavations to generate archaeological and environmental datasets. Geostatistical analysis will elicit patterns of authority and regional relationships in the archaic Hawaiian State. Specifically, this research will compare records of change and regional diversity in settlement and agricultural practices against expectations from more agriculturally productive core regions under direct, centralized chiefly rule. Both the results and syntheses of multiple novel methods will be broadly applicable to modeling social complexity in complex societies world-wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Dadiego, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, will undertake research to study the effectiveness of Spanish economic institutions in a borderland region. Recent studies have illuminated the diverse actions that native groups enacted in response to Spanish colonialism ranging from allying with the Spanish for military support to cleaving out a wedge in the market economy. Current work has considered issues of transculturation, indigenous agency, persistence, and autonomy; however, these examinations focus on the scale of the household or local economy, and neither place native agents within a larger economic network, nor do they consider the agency of Spanish and other European actors in the context of a colonial economy. Colonial Pensacola, Florida provides an ideal stage to examine how monolithic trade policies intersect with economic reality, but this context is not unique. All over the world, past and present, individuals, groups, and institutions innovate and improvise within and against the global market and national trade policies. Understanding how this process played out in the past can lead to a better understanding of how people in local contexts navigate their daily lives within a globally connected economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danielle L. Dadiego combines archival research, traditional artifact analysis, and chemical composition and isotopic analysis of glass beads and lead shot using Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and acid dissolution to study the role that both colonial and native people played in disrupting or contributing to colonial economic institutions. Glass beads are ubiquitous on colonial period sites, common trade items for Europeans, and, most importantly, socially charged items within native thought-worlds. Lead shot is equally ubiquitous; however, it is considered a mundanely functional item. Although broadly recovered from sites, lead shot and monochrome glass beads lack diagnostic physical or stylistic characteristics that would facilitate interpretations of production, distribution, and use patterns. Innovations in methodological techniques, including LA-ICP-MS, allow the use of formerly ignored artifact categories to trace the distribution of goods across the landscape. These chemical methods are used in conjunction with a close examination of historical documents to provide evidence of how goods moved through colonial and indigenous communities, foregrounding the importance of economic agency among settlers and natives, even when these practices challenged idealized models of mercantilism and colonial government regulations. The combination of the datasets described above will provide evidence of how the Spanish reacted or interacted with indigenous exchange systems that were considered illicit based on Spanish trade regulations. Traditional archaeological approaches have equated the Spanish economic system as a dominant force in the colonial economy of Florida, as well as subsumed local or economic agency as illicit or informal. Moreover, determining chemical recipes and identifying compositional groups to illuminate economical choices people made during colonization is a new approach that only just begun to gain momentum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

CDS members are united by a common focus on the developmental origins of perceiving, thinking and learning, and they are also united in the enterprise of bringing varied perspectives and approaches to bear on understanding these processes. Their research addresses developmental time points across the lifespan, and focuses on multi-level biological, behavioral, social and cultural processes shaping the development of cognitive abilities. Because bringing together diverse perspectives and approaches is fundamental to making progress in scientific understanding, CDS has sought to increase diversity in its membership. The CDS seeks to promote the attendance, at its 2019 meeting, of junior scholars (e.g., graduate students, post-docs) from groups traditionally underrepresented in the developmental sciences.  At the conference, these scholars will present their research and participate in a mentoring program which involves pairing them with senior researchers in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present award will increase the diversity of the CDS membership through several mechanisms. The first of these involves providing travel awards for junior scholars from underrepresented groups. The second involves continuing the society's mentoring program in which young scholars are paired with an established researcher. Through an organized meeting at the start of the conference with their mentors, mentees will have the opportunity to begin forging new professional relationships, thereby broadening their academic networks. Mentors will support their mentees by attending the junior scholars' presentations in order to provide support and feedback. The third involves facilitating networking events for junior scholars from this year's (2019) cohort and former recipients of the CDS Diversity Travel Awards from the 2015 and 2017 meetings. Together, these experiences are designed to promote the success of junior scholars from diverse backgrounds as both conference participants and as future independent investigators.

It is now the ten-year anniversary of the first international conference on the Neurobiology of Language, a field that has grown substantially since then and continues to blossom. Studying the neurobiology of language requires highly specialized skills (e.g., brain imaging) and broad multidisciplinary knowledge (e.g., psychology, linguistics, neuroscience). In order to promote scientific inquiry of the highest quality, it is vital to promote dialogue and interaction among the relevant disciplines.  This project explores how to facilitate this interaction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ""neurobiology of language"" is the biological implementation for representations and processes involved in the  production and understanding of speech,  sign, and language in context. Previously, brain structures and functions for language could only be  inferred from studying humans with brain injury. By monitoring the anatomical encodings and physiological dynamics of language processing  in awake, behaving human beings, researchers can now study human language at a biological precision previously possible only in  animal models (of functions other than language). Concomitant with these new approaches has been a  dramatic increase in the number of investigators dedicating their effort to understanding the biological  basis of language. The growth in the number of investigators and the use of expanded techniques and theoretical perspectives have driven the need for enhanced transparency, integrity, and robust and rapid research dissemination.

Formal Language Theory (FLT) is a means to independently assess how a given attested or predicted linguistic pattern compares to other patterns in terms of the expressive power required to describe it.  A grammar formalism with the expressive power to generate all the grammatical patterns found in the languages of the world without generating the non-occurring patterns would facilitate the comparison of different linguistic theories and allow precise claims to be made about the bounds of linguistic complexity.  This workshop has two aims. The first is to take stock of existing work in FLT and its impact on theories of language and of its learnability, and to showcase new directions in which this work is headed. The second is to bring together linguists and computer scientists in order to establish deeper points of contact between their goals and methods as they relate to how both humans and machines can learn and use language, and to identify the most fruitful directions for moving forward. Because of the general nature of FLT, this research can also lead to practical applications broadly, from natural language processing and artificial intelligence to bioinformatics and information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place during the third annual meeting of the Society for Computation in Linguistics (SCiL), which meets as a sister society at the annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA).

With more than half of the world's 7000 languages currently at risk of disappearing--at least 170 of them in the United States alone--there is an urgent need both to create an enduring documentary record of endangered languages and to support teaching and learning of those languages. Given the magnitude of this endangered language crisis, linguists and language communities must seek out strategic partnerships to overcome the most critical challenges, including among others the enormous task of producing (at least some) documentation for the vast number of endangered signed and spoken languages that have little to no documentation, the massive gap between the amount of audiovisual documentation collected, and the amount of transcriptions of these data that are available (i.e., the so-called ""transcription bottleneck""). Despite these large-scale challenges, there are still relatively few partnerships that aim to address them. Thus, this project will open a dialogue between linguists, language community members, and scholars from other disciplines to forge robust and reliable solutions for addressing critical challenges in language documentation and conservation. NSF support will enable a series of targeted workshops and roundtable discussions devoted to bringing stakeholders together around various aspects of initiating and fostering strategic partnerships. The conference will also feature a special interactive plenary event with the express purpose of bringing together participants to create a dialogue about how a renewed focus on identifying and fostering strategic partnerships can be leveraged to meet critical challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception in 2009, ICLDC has become the flagship venue driving scholarship in the documentation, maintenance and revitalization of endangered languages.

Iterations of the International Seminar on Speech Production (ISSP) have taken place at three or four year intervals for the past 31 years with the aim of providing an interdisciplinary forum for researchers working on all aspects of speech production from fields as diverse as phonology, phonetics, prosody, mechanics, acoustics, physiology, motor control, neuroscience, speech technology and human interaction.  The conference series has been held throughout the world, and was last in the US in 1993. Each meeting has attracted a substantial portion of the active researchers in this important yet challenging area of speech research. The current project will allow attendance by 10 students at the conference, with special events and one-on-one meetings with selected senior researchers. Keeping up with the latest in technology and theory is greatly facilitated by an international meeting such as this one, and it provides students with an especially useful entry into the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speech is of critical importance to human communication, and the mechanisms used to produce it are complex and difficult to quantify.  Visible articulators such as the lips and chin (related to jaw height) are relatively easy to assess, but their accurate measurement is difficult. Video images can certainly show aspects of the visible articulators, but the nonlinear compression of the 3D face into a 2D video image makes measurement unreliable, and generally more sophisticated devices are used. Modern technology, such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow a more detailed look at the tongue, which, despite being a major component of speech production, is quite difficult to measure. These advances in data collection have begun to feed into improved models of speech motor control. The 8 keynote speakers at the conference will highlight the wide range of relevant topics, from neuroscience to disordered speech, from acquisition of speech to aging, from the technology of measurement to the influence of measurement on consumer technology.

Because wood was the primary fuel for cooking food in pre-historic Mesoamerican societies, firewood harvesting put significant strain on the forests around ancient settlements.  The absence of beasts of burden limited harvesting to relatively short distances, and the preferred fuelwood trees grow slowly and were likely unable to meet the needs of a growing population. Thus, this research studies the wood charcoal from Postclassic Maya sites to determine whether their access to higher quality firewood declined over time, or whether the sites' inhabitants were able to overcome the challenges mentioned above and sustainably harvest preferred woods. The research will compare the taxa of firewood used in high-status residences, low-status residences, and public feasting events, in order to understand whether the strategies employed by elites to improve or maintain their social position included greater consumption of higher-quality wood fuels.  This project will involve collaboration with archaeologists at several universities in the United States and Mexico, the Comision Nacional de areas Naturales Protegidas in Mexico, and the Kleberg Advanced Microscopy Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This research will also refine archaeometric methods for estimating the diameter of a tree or branch from a charcoal fragment and will contribute to the training of a minority doctoral student in archaeobotanical methods and the use of a scanning election microscope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last several decades, research in anthracology (the study of charcoal recovered from archaeological sites) has become increasingly relevant to understanding of human-environment dynamics and how societies succeed or fail to achieve long-term resource security. The field's understanding of human fuelwood collection is currently based on a model guided by the ""Principle of Least Effort,"" which expects wood gatherers to optimize the amount of energy gained in each harvest. Since the difference in heat release between higher and lower quality fuelwoods is marginal compared to the heavy labor cost of harvesting and transporting wood, this model assumes that ancient harvesters prioritized convenience and were relatively indiscriminating about which species they harvested. While this model appears to adequately explain species distribution of charcoal assemblages in some archaeological cases, it does not fully explain assemblages that are dominated by a few types of wood or differences in the species composition of assemblages deposited contemporaneously at the same archaeological site.  It also assumes that politics and social organization played little role in the way that cultures manage and consume fuelwood. Thus, this research will test the Principle of Least Effort model alongside an alternative model of firewood procurement grounded in Political Ecology and the social dynamics in Postclassic Maya communities.  This latter model hypothesizes that social elites in those communities found ways to preserve their access to preferred wood types. This model predicts that the charcoal assemblages produced by elite activity (particularly those produced by public events like feasting) will be more likely to contain preferred species than assemblages produced by non-elite households.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Although rooted in particular social and economic orders,  social inequality also manifests in individual biology and psychology. However, the complex and interacting connections involved are not well understood; physical and mental health disparities can be both the cause and the effect of social inequality. Understanding how these disparities interact is important because they can be mutually-reinforcing and thus difficult to escape once the cycle has begun. The research supported by this award will investigate these linkages through the lens of food insecurity and the pathways that connect it to mental ill health, as mediated by cultural and social differences. Although the research will be conducted outside of the United States to take advantage of analytically useful comparisons, its findings will be universally applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by anthropologists Dr. Lesley J. Weaver (University of Alabama) and Dr. Craig A. Hadley (Emory University) in three rapidly developing communities in Brazil, Ethiopia, and Haiti.  These research sites were chosen because all three have experienced food shortages in recent memory and in each setting, social inequality is creating noticeable disparities in life chances.  At the same time, the three research sites also differ in scientifically useful ways: they have culturally distinct food cultures and each has a different degree of integration with the global economy. In each site, the researchers will collect information on social and cultural meanings associated with the acquisition, preparation, and consumption of foods; they will do mental and physical health assessments; and they will look at the relationships between these data to weigh the importance of biological (especially nutritional) and cultural factors as pathways that connect food insecurity to mental ill health. Data will be gathered through interviews about health and well-being; participant observation; the collection of basic health biometrics; and the administration of culturally adapted mental health scales. Cross-site comparisons will allow the researchers to assess whether or not there is a shared experience of food insecurity and mental health problems that we are likely to see in other global locations, including the United States. Findings from this research will help to better understand the connection between human society, culture, biology, and psychology.

But this claim is deceptively simple, and it leaves open a host of critical questions about how (and even whether) play and imagination can effectively promote learning. These questions include: How, exactly, does the process of playful learning work? Which dimensions of play sessions or imagined scenarios are particularly effective for children's learning, and why? Which topics do children learn most readily through playful and imaginative activities, and at what ages? How do characteristics of individual children (e.g., executive function, temperament) interact with the process of learning through play and imagination? Integrating information and and answering these questions are important for the implications they hold for educators and media creators . To  stimulate cross-disciplinary discussions, this two-day conference (co-sponsored by the Society for Research in Child Development) aims to identify and fill gaps in the literature on children's learning from playful and imaginative activities, build collaborations across labs and subdisciplines on open research questions, and produce proposals for evidence-based strategies for how these activities can best be used to enhance children's learning and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining traditional talks with interactive activities, and by actively seeking participants both from academic disciplines and practice fields (e.g., media creation, playground and toy design), this conference will give participants a wide view research in learning in and through play and imagination, delve into best practices, and explicitly encourage collaborations and planning for future work to answer crucial open questions in this field.

Research shows that IPV affects young adults at rates higher than other age groups. It is also associated with many negative outcomes, including psychological distress and school drop-out. The costs to society and to individuals is enormous. Among all people who experience IPV, sexual minorities show rates higher than heterosexual individuals. Higher rates of IPV among individuals in this minority group can be explained by the concept of sexual stigma, that is negative attitudes and discrimination directed toward this group. This project develops a model of stigma that identifies two distinct forms: institutional stigma and individual stigma. Institutional stigma refers to the discriminatory practices and policies of an organization or institution. Individual stigma refers to experiencing prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behavior from other people, as well as accepting negative beliefs about this minority group as true. Young adults attending a wide variety of colleges and universities will be surveyed to learn how attending a college that is less supportive toward this minority group (institutional stigma) can lead to feelings of shame and fears of being discriminated against (individual stigma). This project examines the extent to which these stigma experiences increase risk for IPV in this group, and considers multiple pathways for such increased risk, including lower levels of social support, increased drinking, difficulties with managing emotions, and increases in depression. The alarming rates of IPV in this group on college campuses makes it a high public health priority to identify factors that contribute to these increased rates and to ultimately develop effective prevention efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and tests the multi-level sexual stigma model of intimate partner violence (MLSSM-IPV). A longitudinal survey will be conducted of over 20,000 sexual minority and heterosexual students and more than 7,500 faculty, staff, and administrators across 15 large residential colleges and universities. The institutions will vary in the extent to which they have made efforts to establish a supportive climate for students in the minority group. Several hypotheses derived from the MLSSM-IPV model will be tested. One is that universities with higher levels of institutional sexual stigma (as evidenced by discriminatory practices and policies) will have higher rates of individual-level stigma (prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors) among heterosexual staff, faculty, administrators and students, and also higher rates of IPV victimization and perpetration among minority group members. A second hypothesis is that individual-level stigma among this minority group (feelings of shame regarding one's identity, anticipating discrimination from others) will be predicted by both institutional stigma and by individual level-stigma among heterosexual staff, faculty, administrators and students. It is expected that the relationship between stigma and IPV experiences in the minority group will be mediated by emotion regulation difficulties, poor social support, hazardous drinking, and psychological distress. A 6-month follow-up survey with students will examine how stigma and mediators predict IPV experiences. This research will establish the extent to which stigma at the institutional and individual levels relates to increased risk of IPV, and identify mechanisms by which this occurs.

To conserve the existing variety of species, it is important to understand past and present drivers of biodiversity loss. Archaeology and paleoecology provide relevant, long term perspectives on interactions among humans, other organisms, and climate that contribute to extinctions. This project will answer several longstanding questions regarding how a drying climate and the early colonization of Madagascar by humans and associated introduced species may have contributed to past extinctions of large animals on the island. For example, to what extent did humans hunt the now extinct animals? Did introduced animals compete with now-extinct natives, and were introduced animals drought-tolerant relative to natives? Recognizing feedbacks among sources of regional change is a challenge, but this case study of datasets from Madagascar is broadly applicable to the study of past interactions among organisms in the face of aridification. Given the relevance of this research to present environmental concerns and the ongoing development of drought-related policy in arid southwest Madagascar, community and local government outreach is a project priority. This interdisciplinary work involves students and faculty at Malagasy universities, and the students trained through the field component of this research will gain skills applicable to data gathering and natural resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates some of the many ways in which the arrival of humans and introduced species in a novel environment may have contributed to past and ongoing biodiversity loss. The field component of this project focuses on the coast of southwest Madagascar. This region is ideal for studies of environmental changes associated with human activity, because humans and human-introduced animals (e.g. goats, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, and rats) arrived on the island several thousand years ago, and the bones of extinct endemic animals (e.g. pygmy hippos, giant tortoises, elephant birds, and giant lemurs) are abundant along this coastline. Survey and excavation of a series of coastal ponds with traces of past human presence serve to recover the material record of past human activity and biodiversity loss. Radiocarbon dating of bone recovered from fieldwork and museum collections provides the chronological control that is necessary to infer past interactions among humans, other organisms, and environmental change. A series of chemical analyses of radiocarbon-dated bone protein is used to trace aspects of organisms' diets and environments through time. These analyses, coupled with a separately-funded effort to reconstruct the past climate of the region through the chemical analysis of ancient lake sediments, make it possible to examine potential synergies between past human activity and the changing climate that may have driven past extinctions on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

One is that the two languages compete for selection, suggesting bidirectional cross-language influences. Another is that using two or more languages has consequences for cognitive functioning across the lifespan. However, this research has only focused on the long-term consequences of bilingualism. Therefore, it remains unknown how bilinguals draw from domain-general cognition to enable the use of language in real time. Moreover, despite the fact that bilinguals differ among themselves in their language experiences, few of the past studies examining the cognitive consequences of bilingualism have used anything more than measures of self-reported proficiency, and do not provide a comprehensive characterization of the context of language use. Critically, heritage speakers and adult second-language learners are the predominant groups of bilinguals in the US, yet little is known about how these individuals recruit cognitive resources to support the functioning of their languages in a context where one of the two languages predominates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses behavioral and neuroscientific methods to identify the cognitive mechanisms that enable heritage speakers and learners to successfully process language in real time and seeks to challenge the idea that language ability in these populations is solely determined by proficiency and/or incomplete acquisition. Using a recently-developed cross-task adaptation paradigm, the project compares performance of: 1) heritage Speakers of Spanish immersed in an English-dominant environment with Spanish-English bilinguals immersed in a Spanish-dominant environment; and 2) advanced classroom learners of Spanish with learners who are immersed in a Spanish-dominant environment while studying abroad. A key feature of the cross-task adaptation paradigm is that it provides a measure of how conflict experienced in a general cognitive task directly affects the ability to resolve conflict during language processing. Language performance is measured at the level of the lexicon and grammar, comparing comprehension and production in both Spanish and English, using behavioral measures of speed and accuracy, eye-tracking measures during sentence reading, and electrophysiological measures that examine the time course of word production. This program of research shifts the focus of attention to a more dynamic view of language and how it draws from cognition, which holds significance for shaping bilingual education in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This project tests the hypothesis that the reason for this is because redundant (i.e., matching) multisensory information elicits greater attention than does either mis-matching multisensory information or unisensory information. The results from this project will provide key insights into infant perception, attention, learning, and memory and, as a result, they will suggest better ways for helping infants acquire critical cognitive and social skills. In addition, the results will provide new insights into the root causes of some developmental disabilities (e.g., autism) which are known to involve impaired perception and attention to multisensory information. Finally, the results from this project will provide a scientific foundation for the design of  tools that will permit clinicians to more effectively detect and ameliorate impaired attention to multisensory information in young children with developmental disabilities, thereby improving their cognitive and social development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By around 6 months of age, a previously rudimentary, reflex-like selective attention response system becomes transformed into an endogenously driven selective attention system. This new functionality permits infants to deploy their attention to sources of multisensory redundancy that are of specific interest to them. The project seeks to answer three main questions. First, what mechanisms underlie developmental changes in infant selective attention to sources of multisensory redundancy? Second, how does early experience contribute to developmental changes in selective attention to multisensory redundancy in infancy? Third, how does improving selective attention to multisensory redundancy contribute to information processing across different psychological domains? Infants residing in monolingual and bilingual households will be tested with eye tracking methods to assess attention to multisensory redundancy inherent in talking faces. In some cases, eye tracking will be used  with an intersensory matching procedure to examine infant matching of auditory and visual attributes of speech. In other cases, eye tracking will be used with a habituation/test procedure to investigate learning of multisensory events. The investigators will analyze the temporal distribution of attention as well as the latency of responses. The findings from this project will provide novel insights into the emergence of attention and learning in infancy, clues to maximizing attention and learning in typically developing infants, and clues to improving attention and learning in infants at risk for developmental disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The two most commonly used methods, transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), provide tools to manipulate activity in targeted brain regions, and this give cognitive neuroscientists a method to test functional hypotheses. Despite this potential, there are substantial concerns about the reliability and robustness of the physiological and behavioral changes resulting from these NIBS methods, especially when used to induce modulatory perturbations in the state of neural excitability. The purpose of this project is to create a new and more robust method for modulatory NIBS in human participants. The method, referred to as kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation (kTMP), will open a new experimental electromagnetic subspace for perturbing brain function.  This method will open several new opportunities for cortical stimulation: larger electrical fields, more precise timing, better spatial control, and both a greater range and a more precise delivery of stimulation frequency.  <br/><br/>This novel magnetic stimulation holds promise to produce meaningful focal physiological changes, for several reasons. First, subthreshold kilohertz (kHz) electrical stimulation has been shown to alter motor-evoked responses with an effect size similar to that of direct current electric fields. Second, suprathreshold kHz frequency electric fields robustly block nerve conduction in a reversible manner. Third, suprathreshold experiments have shown that kHz tES can mimic low frequency electric fields in the motor cortex of the mouse, presumably due to frequency intermodulation. This project will employ subthreshold electric fields, albeit at much higher amplitude than those presently available with tES and with the frequency specificity not possible with extant TMS methods. kTMP offers a hybrid subthreshold approach that will exploit strong midrange electric field amplitudes with frequency specificity, including frequency intermodulation effects, offering a new approach to perturb brain function. The initial empirical evaluation of kTMP will focus on modulating human motor cortex excitability, the ""gold standard"" approach for evaluating NIBS methods. Importantly, by substantially expanding the range of electric field induction, it should be possible to obtain dose-dependent functions, something that has proven elusive with other subthreshold NIBS methods. Once these benchmark tests are met, kTMP should be readily adopted for basic cognitive neuroscience research, providing a robust tool to perturb and modulate targeted cortical regions as a means to test functional hypotheses in physiological and behavioral studies. In the long term, kTMP has promise to be employed in the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Although there are many studies of how language acquires meaning, little is known about how music becomes meaningful. One hypothesis is that music acquires meaning in part because listeners impose narrative significance to musical events, translating abstract musical sequences into a story line as the notes unfold (a process known as narrative listening).  A series of parallel experiments will be conducted that vary both the structural features of musical excerpts and the cultural background of the listener in order to disentangle questions about the role of nature and experience in the formation of musical meaning. Learning more about the mechanisms that underpin musical meaning fundamentally adds to our understanding of human communication and artistic expression, with the broader potential to lead to improved intercultural exchange. The work will also contribute new methodologies to probe the musical experiences of lay listeners across cultures, who often lack the musical vocabulary to describe their perceptions. By bridging science and the humanities, the project will provide STEM-based research training to students in the humanities and, in turn, expose students in the sciences to questions in the humanities that would benefit from development of novel scientific methodologies. The project's reach will be expanded by the development and dissemination of a new app for collecting crowd-sourced data via cell phone. Embedded GPS technology will allow the researchers to map patterns and variations in narrative listening across geography and cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes a theory-driven and cross-cultural approach to investigate the core factors that shape narrative listening to music. The investigators will obtain a normative set of cross-cultural data on narrative listening for a large sample of Western and Chinese musical excerpts from both American listeners with little exposure to Chinese music and from Chinese listeners will little exposure to Western music. If narrative listening arises from a fundamental tendency to make abstract stimuli concrete, then listeners will tend to ascribe agency to points in the music that violate their expectations in order to make sense of what they hear. If narrative listening arises from enculturation, people should be more likely to perceive narratives in music from their own culture than from a different culture. Within a culture, people should be more likely to perceive narratives for high topical-association music than for low topical-association music. Lastly, the investigators will examine the relationship between narrative listening and other well-studied aspects of music perception, providing novel insights about established phenomena and opening up new avenues of investigation.",2019

The ease with which sentences are produced has led to speculations that sentence production may not rely on executive functions such as inhibitory control. This project aims to test whether inhibitory control plays a role in grammatical production by focusing on subject-verb agreement 'attraction' errors. In English, the subject of the sentence agrees with the verb in number (e.g., ""The lion is red,"" ""The lions are red"").  Attraction errors arise when the sentence contains a second noun with a different grammatical number than the subject noun, as in ""The lion next to the birds ARE red.""  Understanding the role of inhibitory control in sentence production could provide key insights on how to evaluate and treat language impairments, as well as how to develop more effective pedagogical methods for children who produce non-adult-like syntactic structures. The proposed research provides opportunities to bring together undergraduate and graduate students in medical and cognitive science research, and the outcome of this research will be disseminated to the broader public through community outreach programs and aphasia rehabilitation projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project uses two approaches to investigate whether subject-verb agreement errors are independent of executive (inhibitory) control.

With time, the resulting dependencies alter the people, the plants, and the social and ecological systems in which both operate. As most research into human-plant relationships in the past focuses on the histories of domesticated crops, less is known about the dynamics of change through time in systems based on wild plants and the ecological legacy of these systems. Grace Ward, doctoral candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, will study long-term wild plant management by investigating the interactions between people and plants living in the Lower Mississippi Valley roughly 4,000 years ago. This research will provide context for subsequent land use in the region, and insight into past strategies employed to live sustainably in the Mississippi floodplain. Through planned data-sharing and in-field education programs, the project is designed to extend archaeological training to local and indigenous descendant communities in a resource-impoverished area of the American South. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with geoarchaeologists, Ward and student assistants will excavate and analyze plant remains from archaeological contexts associated with the Poverty Point culture. This cultural complex lasted from approximately 4,500 to 3,000 years ago in the Lower Mississippi Valley and is defined by the fluorescence of a shared material culture and significant innovations in earthen monumental architecture. Prior work indicates that during this period and for centuries after, people in the Lower Mississippi Valley hunted and gathered wild foods and materials without reliance on domesticated plants or animals. While anthropologists have historically classed hunter-gatherer societies as inherently simple and static, monumental earthen architecture constructed during this period indicates social processes involving massive group aggregation and labor mobilization. Did plant foraging strategies shift in accordance with these markers of social change? Ward and colleagues will study the entwined histories of wild plant management and monumental construction to approach this question, informed by observed patterns in the density, diversity, and morphology of plant remains identified in samples taken from Poverty Point contexts. While the monuments of the Poverty Point culture have been included in global surveys of hunter-gatherer cultural expression, the economy underlying their construction has not been adequately explained in a manner that facilitates cross-cultural comparison. Analysis of the relationship between people and plants during this period will allow for empirical comparison with other regions in which wild plant management supported complex social structures, deepening discipline-wide understanding of the many permutations of human-environment relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Under the direction of Dr. David Meltzer, Ryan Breslawski will undertake research to understand how past peoples responded to one especially severe and long-lasting episode of aridity and drought on the North American Great Plains: the Altithermal, which took place ca. 8,000 to 5,000 years ago. Importantly, while aridity and drought are challenges to human societies, their effects are rarely uniform over large geographic areas, and thus a diversity of human adaptive responses may develop, especially in foraging societies lacking domesticated foods. Did geographic variability in Altithermal aridity and drought drive subsistence variability across space in past foraging societies? Can this variability be linked to declines in the availability of prey animals? Archaeology is an essential tool for resolving these questions and clarifying the processes through which human societies have adapted over millennia. The investigators will explore these questions through work with past bison hunting peoples on the Great Plains. Results from the project will shed light not only on Great Plains prehistory, but also on the effects of climate change on North America鈥檚 grasslands. Millions of people depend on the Greats Plains ecosystem today, as does the ongoing recovery of the iconic American bison. As climate change continues, the full picture of its past impacts on the Great Plains will only become more relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research suggests that 8000鈥?000 years ago much of western North America experienced hyperaridity and drought. Overall, surface water became scarce, vegetation cover decreased, and animal populations declined. However, not all areas were impacted in similar ways or to the same degree, and human responses to these impacts would not have been uniform throughout the region. Regional variation in these impacts and the human responses to them remain poorly documented. Further, much remains to be learned about how bison, a vital resource for Great Plains peoples, were impacted by Altithermal drought and aridity, and the degree to which these impacts were mediated by geography. To resolve these issues, the project will analyze bison remains from over two dozen previously excavated archaeological sites dating to this period and located throughout the Great Plains.The project will collect data on the butchery activities of past human hunters represented by each set of bison remains, as well as data on the environmental stresses experienced by these prey animals. Environmental stresses will be examined through dental defects that result from malnutrition, and through the stable isotope chemistry of teeth, which reflects the food and water that past bison consumed. The results will be used to identify potential links between geographic variability in climate change, bison population declines, and human responses to those declines during this period of extreme aridity and drought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Even basic perception of the world is not as simple as light coming into the eyes or sound coming into the ears.  Rather, perception involves combining the incoming sensory information with cognitive processes such as past experiences, knowledge about the world, and personal tendencies.  In other words, two people observing the same events (i.e., receiving the same sensory information) can arrive at different interpretations of what is happening in the environment.  How the brain combines sensory information with these cognitive processes, and where this occurs in the brain, is incompletely understood.  The key innovation of this project is to use a brain-computer interface (BCI) to tease apart which aspects of the brain's activity are sensory versus cognitive and how the two are combined in the brain to produce perception of the world.  BCIs are widely-known for their ability to help paralyzed patients and amputees by allowing them to move a computer cursor or robotic arm simply by thinking about moving.  Few studies have used BCIs as an experimental tool to understand sensory areas of the brain, as this project seeks to do.  This work is likely to lead to a deeper understanding of how we perceive the world, as well as insights into how BCI can be used to help treat psychiatric disorders and recover function after injury.  Furthermore, the investigators are developing BCI-based lab exercises for undergraduate courses, training researchers to become well-versed in experimental and computational neuroscience, and involving undergraduates, including women and underrepresented minorities, in the research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on visual area V4, which is known to be a crossroads for sensory and cognitive processes during visual perception.  To dissect what aspects of neural activity are sensory versus cognitive, the investigators train animal subjects to volitionally modulate their V4 activity.  The BCI provides subjects with moment-by-moment auditory feedback of their V4 activity.  This project assesses what aspects of V4 activity can be volitionally (i.e., cognitively) modulated, how volitional modulation of V4 activity affects visual perception, and how malleable is the interaction between V4 and another brain area (prefrontal cortex) during visual perception.  The key advantage of using BCI for this study is that it allows the investigators to challenge the subjects to produce particular patterns of neural activity.  The investigators can specify in the BCI which patterns of activity yield a reward.  This technique allows them to assess what aspects of the neural activity can be volitionally controlled by the animal (i.e., cognitive), and what aspects are hard-wired to the outside world (i.e., sensory). The applications of this BCI paradigm are extremely broad, and can be used to study other sensory, cognitive, and motor systems.",2019

The advanced scientific knowledge will have broader impacts, including the possible transformation of gait rehabilitation approaches and enhanced understanding of learning and memory in the human brain. Further, this work includes interdisciplinary neuroscience training of promising students with diverse ethnic, gender, and academic backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to understand the mechanisms for human locomotor adaptation and learning. While motor learning has received ample attention in studies utilizing upper limbs, there are relatively few studies of motor learning in the context of human locomotion. These experiments will examine the commonalities as well as task-specific distinctions across different types of locomotor learning paradigms: sequence learning, visuomotor adaptation and dynamic (split-belt treadmill) adaptation. Specifically, this work will examine how consolidation leads to offline learning and resistance to interferences between different walking patterns, and the immediate and delayed benefits of variable practice on the generalization of learning. This research will also examine the role of sleep in consolidation and generalization of locomotor learning. The integrated educational plan will provide interdisciplinary neuroscience training to undergraduate and graduate students in order to develop and retain young scientists in the area of movement neuroscience. The project will promote active participation from underrepresented students in order to equip women and minorities to pursue STEM education. The project team will engage in public outreach and the dissemination of scientific progress to regional communities, to enhance general interest in science and technology amongst the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

The research will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about complex interactions between early environment, the microbiome, and physiological well-being in primates, including humans. Specifically, the study will combine genetic and behavioral sampling on infant care in the nest and pilot new forest canopy data collection methods for infants, their nests, and their mothers鈥?complex cooperative infant care strategies, focusing on a recent birth cohort. The project also will build on partnerships with K-12 classroom teachers, primate conservation educators, and developers at Google Expeditions to generate online content, including the creation of lesson plans and virtual reality 鈥渆xpeditions,鈥?that will engage, teach, and train primary and secondary school students from diverse backgrounds in field research in the STEM sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A growing body of research shows that interactions between primate hosts and the microbial communities in their gut are complex and beneficial. Hosts, in particular, rely on microorganisms for processes ranging from digestion to immunity. However, despite the critical importance of host-microbe interactions, the factors responsible for their development and maintenance are not well understood. Ruffed lemurs in the wild are characterized by substantial variation in the numbers, types, and strengths of their social relationships, providing an opportunity to study the relative effects of different biological, environmental, and social forces on establishing and maintaining gut microbial diversity. The investigators will therefore use a combination of field observations and nest cams to continuously monitor ruffed lemur infant care behaviors in the nest; tree climbing and canopy-based research to sample infants, their mothers, and their nests for microbiome data; and veterinary health assessments to link social behavior and microbiome development to long-term physiological outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Yet achievement gaps continue to separate racial minority and lower-income students from White and higher-income students. Research designed to reduce these achievement gaps largely focuses on student characteristics, such as motivation, belonging, and performance. The resulting interventions often aim to change the way students engage with the school context.  However, eliminating achievement gaps may require more than changing individual students.  It may require changing the prevailing social norms and beliefs that undermine racial minority and low-income students' success. This project examines how school leaders might be trained to build culturally inclusive and sustainable learning environments. The goal is to shape the beliefs that schools and teachers hold about diverse students and the practices they use to engage students from different racial and social class backgrounds. These culturally inclusive changes in the learning environment are expected to improve racial minority and low-income students' academic outcomes by fostering a sense of belonging and positive beliefs about learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a district-wide intervention to create cultural change within schools. The intervention focuses on teaching educational leaders to understand and validate multiple cultural ways of being in their schools and classrooms, such that all students feel that they belong and are capable of succeeding in school. Educational leaders will learn to change their school cultures by attending week-long workshops that provide theoretical and practical information about engaging cultural differences in educational contexts. The workshop curriculum has been piloted with educators and works to bridge the gap between empirical research and real-world classroom experiences. The curriculum reflects research-based understandings of how culture influences cognitive development, motivation, and emotional expression. It also offers concrete strategies for applying empirical knowledge in educational settings. The research examines how this intervention shapes a) the policies district and school leadership enact; b) the classroom cultures teachers create and the practices they use with diverse students; and c) students' psychological and academic outcomes, particularly among racial minority and low-income students. Teaching institutional leaders to understand and validate diverse cultural backgrounds is expected to improve minority and low-income students' educational experiences and reduce racial and social class achievement gaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience. This project will establish new multidisciplinary approaches to tackle such complex problems as climate change adaptation, and train graduate students from the partner institutions and countries in international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vining and his team will examine how prehispanic agriculturalists developed and switched between various productive strategies as the el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) changed in frequency and severity.  The study region, north coastal Peru, hosted a series of civilizations between approximately 2000 BC - 1450 AD, including the Moche, Lambayeque, and Chimu societies.  However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.  The researchers will use this multidisplinary methodological background to improve historic reconstructions of past ENSO variations, record archaeological examples of agricultural technologies in their environmental context, and reconstruct how different strategies were employed as ENSO effected climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

This collaborative project between the American Association of Geographers (AAG), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Michigan's Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) will enhance an infrastructural resource that will advance scientific research by building capacity for data sharing in geospatial data-intensive research communities in the social, environmental, and related sciences that use geospatial data.  The GVDE resource will make a wide range of geospatial, spatial statistical, and geographic information system software available to allow researchers to share, access, build on, and conduct new research involving confidential data within the enclave.  It will be a secure research environment for sharing confidential geospatial research data, thereby enabling the replication of prior research involving confidential geospatial data.  The GVDE will create new research infrastructure for scientists to share data so that research results are replicable and national investments in data creation are preserved for subsequent analysis.  The project will train researchers in techniques to protect confidentiality in geospatial data.  Graduate students will be involved in the enhancement of this infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to replicate and reproduce research is a corner-stone of scientific methodology.  The generation and analysis of geospatial and locational data is at the frontier of many scientific domains, yet the unique characteristics of these data present special challenges to data-sharing practices due to the need to protect the locational privacy and confidentiality of research subjects.  The privacy challenges of confidential geospatial data are not yet fully understood by many members of the scientific research community.  As a result, research is often impeded by uncertainty regarding geospatial data confidentiality or by a lack of effective methods for safely sharing and accessing confidential geospatial research data for analysis or replication.  To address these problems, the investigators will enhance the GVDE and its core capabilities to share, access, analyze, and replicate geospatial data.  They will evaluate and implement confidentiality protection techniques to enable researchers to anonymize and export maps, analyses, and visualizations derived from analyses conducted in the GVDE.  They will develop and implement a researcher credentialing system to provide trained and trusted researchers with a durable digital identifier to safely access and use the GVDE.  They will also ensure the long-term sustainability of the GVDE system and expand its availability to the broader geospatial research community through outreach, dissemination, and the development of training materials on system use, data confidentiality ethics, credentialing requirements, research replication, and best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

Specific aims of the study are to investigate whether ERI mitigates or worsens the association between racial discrimination and development as well as identify mechanisms by which ERI influences development during the transition to adulthood. This project will improve understanding of how ERI operates and the role social context plays in the associations between racial discrimination and development. The project will also address theoretical debates about the presumed positive impact of ERI.  Developmental outcomes during the transition to adulthood will be assessed using questionnaires and physiological stress reactivity tests. Broader impacts are significant, because findings can be used to improve the social and psychological well-being of vulnerable youth. Moreover, findings can potentially support and further evidence-based prevention-intervention efforts aimed at fostering positive youth development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racial discrimination constitutes a significant risk to the healthy development of African American youth during the transition to adulthood. Some evidence suggests that ERI protects against the harmful effects of racial discrimination, but there have been few systematic attempts to disentangle mixed findings. Participants will be African American young adults attending a southeastern, predominantly White institution and a mid-Atlantic historically Black college/university. Students will complete a series of questionnaires assessing key study variables followed by two laboratory challenges, once a year, for three consecutive years. Autonomic reactivity (as indexed by cardiovascular psychophysiology) will be assessed during the laboratory challenges. The central questions of the study are whether the protective or vulnerability function of ERI is influenced by the social context in which the youth are embedded and whether the impact of ERI on biopsychosocial development can be explained by coping skills, self-esteem, and perceptions of racial discrimination. Key hypotheses are: 1) ERI will act as a vulnerability factor in the link between racial discrimination and development in contexts with lower levels of diversity; 2) Initial levels of racial discrimination will lead to changes in ERI, which, in turn, will be associated with changes in development; and 3) Racism appraisals and coping will explain the association between ERI and changes in development during the transition to adulthood. Hypotheses will be tested using latent growth curve modeling. These results will be used to inform recommendations for the development of a contextually-tailored pilot ERI intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2019

When the content or timing of this auditory feedback signal is experimentally altered, most speakers rapidly modify their speech. This project will primarily address how the timing of auditory feedback impacts the speech production system and will assess individual differences in the use of auditory feedback. Results will guide development of a computational model of speech planning and production that has the potential to accelerate the design of new therapeutic approaches to developmental and acquired disorders of speech. Additional benefits to society will accrue from a series of teaching modules that will be developed that explore the role of auditory feedback in normal and disordered speech. The project team will also develop educational materials that bridge neuroscience and communication sciences and that provide formative experiences for undergraduate and K-12 students, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds and with disabilities, to attract them to future study in this area. All project materials will be made available as a public database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use a combination of experimental and computational studies. The first research goal is to determine the role of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) on speech sequencing using multimodal experimental techniques. Acoustic data will be collected and analyzed to determine the impact of DAF on the production of non-word syllable sequences and sentences. These data will be used to assess the types of errors elicited by DAF and the relationship between these effects and responses to rapid shifts in the frequency content, rather than timing, of the feedback signal. The collected data and perceptual evaluations, obtained via a crowdsourcing platform, will enable the study of individual speaker variability. Data will also be made available as a large public database of speech under altered feedback conditions. The second research goal is to develop a computational model, informed also by kinematic measures of speech from a subset of participants, that can capture the interaction of auditory feedback with speech sequence production. The model will simulate a series of hypotheses about the interactions among speech perception and planning and production components and assess their ability to account for the patterns of errors observed in the experimental data. The model will also assess the sources of individual variation in susceptibility to the effects of DAF, as observed experimentally.",2019

Although the discipline would seem to be in an ideal position to attract scientists from a variety of backgrounds, it is remarkably non-diverse, a lost opportunity in light of the scientific gains that are realized by groups working from multiple perspectives. By bringing together multiple perspectives, diverse teams lower their levels of confirmation bias and produce better scientific outcomes. In addition, fields with ethnically diverse researchers are more likely to have individuals who can successfully anticipate, recognize and navigate potentially delicate social and political issues, including those that are commonly encountered by our leading field investigators in countries across the globe.  This project will build infrastructure to train and retain minority students currently in physical (biological) anthropology and create outreach programs to raise the discipline's visibility in minority communities.  The program further provides for the enhancement of scientific education in K-12 classrooms through the development of teacher training, lesson plans and visiting scientist programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main focus of the IDEAS program is mentoring and outreach activities at the annual American Association of Physical Anthropologists (AAPA) meeting, the main interchange of scientific information in the discipline. The IDEAS Workshop will bring minority and first generation college students to the AAPA meeting for a pre-meeting, science and mentoring workshop and networking activities throughout the meeting. IDEAS Faculty, matched with students based on scientific area, will serve as on-site and year-long mentors. Social media and community outreach efforts will aim to foster interest in human and primate biology and evolution.  In conjunction with the annual meeting, IDEAS Scholars will participate in AAPA K-12 teacher training workshops and conduct classroom visits at local minority serving schools. IDEAS Scholars will also present science talks at local minority serving colleges. The IDEAS web portal links to social media, including a YouTube channel that will host video interviews with minority scientists (some in Spanish) about their scientific work and career path, and connect minority students with targeted research and training opportunities. The IDEAS team will partner with minority serving societies such as NESCent and SACNAS to bring physical anthropology to minority college communities and will develop promotional materials including a booklet entitled How I Became A Physical Anthropologist (in English and Spanish) to engage school-age children. The Broader Impacts infrastructure will offer a variety of means for partner scientists to build and expand their own Broader Impacts program and develop synergies between Broader Impact programs across the discipline.  This infrastructure includes the web portal for connecting their research opportunities with minority students, satellite IDEAS Workshops, topical video production for a YouTube channel, and class lesson plan development for our visiting classroom library. The influence of our programs on the AAPA and discipline will also be monitored via yearly demographic and climate surveys of the membership and will be assessed by a professional evaluator for effectiveness.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vbinpLwAAAAJ,"['Música', 'Musicología', 'Barroco', 'España', 'América colonial']",58,5,1,1,1,2,5,2,4,2,6,6,5,2,3,1,5,6,5,,,,,,,

One fundamental question is: can any of the potential envionmental drivers of evolutionary change be reconstructed with enough precision to allow us to relate them with confidence to the episodes of speciation, extinction and cultural evolution known to anthropologists, and thereby test their relationships in time and space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team of paleoanthropologists and earth scientists plans to analyze climate and other environmental histories to provide direct tests of key hypotheses linking environmental  history and mammal (including early human) evolution by collecting and analyzing detailed paleoenvironmental data at three key anthropological sites in Africa. They will collect continuous paleoenvironmental records by drilling long sediment cores from ancient lake beds in the northern Afar, Ethiopia (~3.8-2.9 million years ago-Ma), the Baringo Basin, Kenya (~3.2-2.35 Ma), and the Turkana Basin, Kenya (~2.3-1.42 Ma), and relate these records to the outcrops in the same basins that contain early human and other mammal fossils, as well as stone tools in the younger time periods. As a group these basins contain some of the most critical evidence for human evolutionary history in Africa. Although past investigators have reconstructed climate and other environmental histories from the outcrops in which the fossil humans and artifacts have been found, such environmental records are highly discontinuous due to the nature of the sediments where the fossils occur, and are unsuitable for many of the most informative geochemical records available today because of the weathering that has affected outcropping sediments. Drilling lakebeds near the fossil sites gets around these problems, because lake sediments accumulate much more continuously, and because drilling into the subsurface allows unweathered samples to be collected  Funding for the drilling costs for this project has been secured from other sources: with the IPG funds the team will analyze the cores to generate quantitative and high resolution records of changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, fire and volcanic activity and other factors which may have influenced human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research goal is to obtain long cores from these basins, each of which span critical intervals in human evolution and are close to hominin fossil and archaeological sites. The researchers will apply state-of-the-art paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate methods to these cores to assemble high resolution records covering much of the past four million years of East African environmental history. The team will then evaluate existing hypotheses and generate new hypotheses linking climate history to early human physical and cultural evolutionary adaptations. The paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data collected from the drill cores will be linked directly in time and space to the nearby fossil human, mammal and stone tool records by way of the numerous volcanic ashes present in both the cores and outcrops, along with other dating techniques. By comparing the new records to similar records from nearby ocean sediment cores the researchers plan be able to distinguish local from global drivers of environmental change and in the process test a series of hypotheses linking key events in human evolution with climate and other aspects of environmental history. Finally, the team will use these new, combined paleoenvironmental and paleoanthropological data sets, combined with novel modeling techniques to better understand how landscape and climate change across various scales of time and space may have affected the availability and predictability of critical ecosystem resources upon which early humans would have depended. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will greatly expand our understanding of African climate history and will be an opportunity to invigorate interest in human evolution and its relationship to climate with the US and African public.

Large-scale land investments are often touted for providing local communities with access to capital, employment opportunities, and higher crop yields. Research suggests, however, that these investments are often accompanied by forced evictions, loss of livelihoods, and food insecurity. The link between large-scale land investments, food security, and peace remains poorly understood. Understanding this link has the potential to inform U.S. efforts to promote development and political stability in regions where food security and broader notions of security are intimately tied. This project contributes toward such an understanding by examining the local impact of large-scale land investments in northern Sudan, where Saudi, Egyptian and Emirati investors have recently acquired large tracts of land to grow food for export. In particular, it explores the social transformations set in motion by these land deals in Sudan's agricultural Gezira region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by Stanford University anthropology doctoral student, Nisrin Elamin Abdelrahman, under the supervision of Dr. James Ferguson. Through a 12-month ethnographic study in two Gezira communities, the researcher will closely examine the role local leaders play in mediating community efforts to reclaim access to lands leased to foreign investors. She will observe dispute mediations in and outside of court settings. She will also participate in the day-to-day activities of small farmers and landless agricultural workers who are negotiating the opportunities and losses produced by recent changes in land ownership. Finally, she will trace the development of a campaign led by civil society organizations aimed at building national awareness around land rights. Data will be collected using participant observation, interviews, life histories, dispute mediation observations, and archival research. The findings can inform policy efforts to better address the context-specific impact of large-scale land investments on local people's lives. By highlighting how local leadership is mobilized to prevent conflicts over land and to broaden access to it, this research will help advance both the study and practice of peace-building in the wider region.

The development of urban societies is critical in human history. Urbanism continues to be a current dominant settlement trend, and involves especially intensive modes of environmental modification and stress. The fluctuations of urban societies have often been attributed to climate variability, the over-exploitation of agricultural and natural resources, and the ability of humans to respond to such challenges. Archaeology is ideally positioned to examine these processes because it traces long-term impacts of different modes of environmental modification and resource use over the entire course of past climate change events, and generates models for more or less effective strategies in different contexts. This research will produce data that is relevant to widespread contemporary concerns, (in the United States and beyond), where a wide variety of environments, urban infrastructures, and technologies must be mobilized to address national strategies for coping with a changing climate. It is also relevant in areas in which there are globally invested development interests, such as Africa or the Middle East, where policies for engaging with often de-centralized urban systems require models for understanding alternative urban strategies for coping with local needs. This research investigates the ways in which urban systems of the past in Lebanon, and their attendant environmental technologies, provide insight into diverse strategies that allowed for settlement rejuvenation within very small timespans. This will generate new insight into urban resilience, which has direct implications for international development policies. This project also directly contributes to collaborative training programs and international comparative research by providing training opportunities for Lebanese and international students and the first microbotanical reference collections for the Archaeology program at AUB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this project, Ms. Damick will examine changes in plant use and processing technologies over the course of early urbanization at two sites in coastal Lebanon.  The early urban settlements of Lebanon are much smaller than in neighboring areas, and show evidence for periodic expansion and contraction throughout their occupation history; however, they appear to have been less vulnerable to the broader regional de-urbanization movements of the ""4.2k arid event"" than the settlements of neighboring areas. This research uses a close analysis of the microbotanical and ground stone tool evidence from Tell Fadous-Kfarabida (TFK) in the north and Sidon in the south, to reconstruct and compare plant production and processing over the course of urbanization in one of the least understood areas of the Levant. Through an analysis of grinding tool use wear and microbotanical evidence, contextualized within regional palaeoenvironmental and site-specific occupation records, Ms. Damick will develop a comparative model for how these small-scale early urban societies reacted to climate variability in relation to their micro-environments and their geo-political orientations.

Border areas, both past and present, are locations of frequent and often contentious redefinitions of the traditions that underlie shared identities. Archaeological approaches to identity in border areas provide the long-term and multi-scalar perspective necessary for understanding the complex causes and consequences of these changes. What strategies were used to resist change and were they successful? How and why were traditions from neighboring groups sometimes borrowed or appropriated? This research is concerned with addressing these questions by examining multiple classes of materials and how these were combined in ways that reinforced or contested and eventually redefined traditional practices. Understanding variation in responses to border interactions and their long-term implications is significant given they occur more widely and frequently today than ever before in human history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prehispanic populations of northeastern Honduras were positioned at the border of Mesoamerica and Lower Central America. Despite shifting affiliations with groups to the north and south, the northeastern region remained a cohesive entity with minimal social inequality and internally shared styles and practices for over 1,200 years, beginning around A.D. 300. Previous research suggests this long term stability can be attributed to the active promotion of symbols of identity that purposefully blended local and exotic styles to express both internal cohesion and strategic external affiliations. The actual implementation of this strategy, however, remains unexplored. Rather than rely on stylistic analyses alone, the present study combines analyses of ceramic style with a concern for where and how ceramic vessels were used in practice. In many cases, vessels that portray symbols or designs expressing identity were combined with foods and practices that were equally as important in defining or contesting those identities. By looking at foodways - the resources and food-related practices particular to a group - in conjunction with ceramic style, the possibility for multiple or conflicting identities is recognized. If local groups were able to balance local tradition with shifting affiliations, how was this accomplished? Were ceramic styles and foodways signaling the same external affiliations or were there multiple or competing influences represented? Archaeological excavations of communal feasting events and the characterization of cooking residues in and stylistic elements on ceramic vessels in these settings will provide a long-term perspective on how both foods and styles were employed. Tracing how these significant elements of identity were combined over time, and the source of influences for both, will provide information for disentangling the processes by which identity was negotiated and highlight the varied ways in which groups embrace, appropriate, and resist change in response to interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes significant collaboration with descendent community leaders and government representatives to increase the representation of indigenous heritage in the regional museum, with the goal of encouraging tourists to visit local communities.

A key focus of Paleolithic archaeological and anthropological research is the study of the origin of modern human behaviors, including cognitive and behavioral similarities and differences between our species and our closest relative, the Neandertals. Much evidence suggests that the Neandertal and modern human populations that overlapped geographically and chronologically exhibited similar behaviors. Ultimately, however, modern human populations replaced Neandertals, but the mechanisms behind Neandertal extinction remain a subject of continued debate. This project considers the implications for standardized bone tool technology in Neandertal contexts. This particular technology may have been innovated by Neandertals, passed by acculturation from modern humans to Neandertals, or, conversely, learned by modern humans from Neandertals. The data collected from this project will provide an independent line of evidence that will contribute to the discussions on the nature of cognition related to technology, the relationship between Neandertals and modern humans, and the understanding of Neandertal extinction. The significant international collaborative component of this project will bring various viewpoints (more traditional and more technology-driven approaches) together to form a cohesive research program. Additionally, this project will establish new methodological approaches for research on bone tools by combining traditional qualitative with innovative quantitative analyses. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the understanding of hominin behavior through a detailed analysis of bone tools before and after the replacement of Neandertals by modern humans.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project by PhD candidate Naomi L. Martisius (University of California, Davis), under the supervision of Dr. Teresa E. Steele, will build a research program around the study of recently described Neandertal-made bone tools, called lissoirs (a French term meaning ""smoothers""), and investigates their potential function and innovation through experimental and comparative research. This discovery shows that Neandertals were capable of producing standardized bone tools, a technology previously thought to have been restricted to modern humans. This research will assess modern human-made lissoirs to understand the extent of their variation in relation to function within these tools, engaging in experimental and comparative research to investigate raw material selection, if ribs were pre-shaped or shaped through use, and how they were used through an innovative approach to study the traces left on bones through use, and an attempt to identify additional pieces from other Neandertal assemblages to determine their temporal span.

Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=v0mXDSsAAAAJ,"['archaeology', 'history', 'anthropology', 'historical archaeology', 'science and technology studies']",877,15,,,4,6,15,14,27,17,23,39,73,67,86,53,78,83,69,,,,89,52,56,5

The organization of pastoral societies informs and shapes the role pastoralists play in regional cultural and political processes. Throughout history, pastoralists have been instrumental in shaping larger processes such as the emergence and evolution of the earliest cities and states, the institutionalization of social inequality, and long distance exchange networks. Archaeological research affords a deep-time perspective on how pastoralists affect larger regional processes through their modes of economic organization and herd management. Because of their relatively light archaeological footprint, however, pastoralists are vastly underrepresented in the prehistoric record. Scholars must depend on a number of indirect measures to detect pastoral activities: proxies that tend to lump pastoralists into broad categories that mask their organizational diversity. This project contributes to an increasing body of recent archaeological scholarship centering on the role of pastoralists as significant agents of social and political change in general. The criteria developed for identifying variability in pastoral practices are thus applicable to an array of archaeological sites in different times and places. Because of its geographic setting in Armenia and Iran, this project also contributes to the resurgence of collaboration between American and Armenian scholars since the 1990s and provides a small but significant intellectual and academic contribution to the thawing relationship between the United States and Iran. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Samei uses economic theory to understand the organizational variability of pastoralists by focusing on economic specialization and population mobility. These two variables define four models of pastoral organization, each with a unique set of expectations for faunal remains and stable isotopes. A battery of analytical methods, such as herd animal demographics, is used to study economic specialization. Specialization should manifest itself in the species composition of herds, age-sex structures, and the types of animal products exploited. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope values from tooth enamel carbonate and bone collagen track animal provisioning as well as mobility along topographic and seasonal gradients. These methods will be applied to investigate the fit between the models and the faunal remains from two sites in the South Caucasus, where pastoralism played a central but ambiguous role in shaping broader mechanisms of cultural change and migration; mechanisms that made the Kura-Araxes cultural tradition of the Caucasus (mid 4th-late 3rd millennium BC) the most extensive cultural horizon in southwest Asia prior to the 6th century BC. The fortified settlement of K閺嬫ne Shahar in Iran (ca. 3300-3200 BC) and the Areni-1 cave complex in Armenia (ca. 4300-3400 BC) are ideal sites as they are characterized by exceptional bone preservation.

Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AjKs41AAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'Aztecs', 'Household Archaeology', 'Gender', 'Ceramic Analysis']",329,9,,,,,,1,1,4,10,6,23,11,42,35,49,15,42,,,,35,21,22,8

Iron has long been viewed as an important catalyst for societal development yet few studies have effectively demonstrated evidence of changes in the scale of production or the impact that sudden access to high quality sources had on agricultural, architectural and military activities. Archaeology offers critical new insight into the way that iron was made, distributed and consumed over time as well as identifying the type of political-economic relationships between the state and local stake holders who lived around major resources. Fundamental to this investigation is how and why do major sources suddenly become a critical part of state development? New technologies and increased access are two important factors enabling control over resources that were often known but left untouched for hundreds of years. Parallel processes are witnessed today within the oil and gas industry and the expansion of China?s global resource interests across Asia and Africa.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hendrickson?s team will investigate whether intensification and control of industrial activities were responsible for vast and sudden imperial expansion in the past. The geographic focus of the project is the Phnom Dek region in central Cambodia, the largest iron ore source available to the Angkorian Khmer Empire. The research team comprising archaeologists, archaeometallurgists, paleobotanists, and geologists will record the spatial and temporal history of industrial production and the relationship between the state consumers and local producers over a period of five hundred years. Excavation and intensive survey of smelting sites will identify critical changes in production technology and corresponding shifts in the quantity and quality of iron used for tools and weapons. The impact of this industrial history will be examined on two levels. First, what type of control did the state exert over the groups responsible for producing iron? Second, is there a direct correlation between increased production and major architectural building episodes and military campaigns undertaken by the Khmer Empire? The results will provide a dynamic history of resource management and political process that will become a benchmark for understanding the successes and failures of states and their impact on manufacturing communities.

It has historically been thought to help people buffer risks. Largely, however, past work has focused on agricultural societies, with fewer studies considering how surpluses were produced and managed under other economic systems. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. William Marquardt, Victor Thompson, and Michael Savarese will conduct research at the Mound Key and Pineland archaeological sites to investigate the role of surplus production among the Calusa of southwest Florida, who were the most powerful group in peninsular Florida in the sixteenth century A.D. The Calusa king collected tribute from a population in excess of 20,000 distributed among 50 to 60 Calusa communities extending from the northern reaches of Charlotte Harbor to the Florida Keys. However, unlike the farming people of the interior river valleys of the southeastern U.S., the Calusa relied primarily on fish and shellfish for protein, collecting wild plant foods and using only a handful of plants from home gardens. Most importantly, they did not grow maize, which formed the basis of surplus production and political complexity for many groups across the Southeast. This project focuses on surplus production and distribution in a complex fisher-gatherer-hunter society. Few archaeologists have examined surplus production among fisher-gatherer-hunters, especially those in the sub-tropics. This research will shed light on long-term sustainability of fisheries, a topic of considerable world-wide interest, and address the potential impact of over-harvesting shellfish. The project will also help train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, both undergraduate and graduate students. As part of the research, the team will teach a field school that will involve students drawn from a broad geographical region. Students will be trained in research, as well as specialized methods and traditional archaeological excavation. The research will bring students with interests in archaeology, geology, and ecology together to address a burgeoning field in geoscience: conservation paleobiology (applying the theories and analytical tools of paleontology to solving problems concerning the conservation of biodiversity). The project will also partner with the Florida Public Archaeology Network as well as the Randell Research Center to engage the public throughout the research process.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, by means of coring and archaeological excavations in structures thought to be fish and shellfish storage and processing features, the team will examine how the Calusa produced and managed large-scale food surpluses presumed to be necessary to sustain their large populations. This work aims to discover how surplus production was situated within the larger histories of the Calusa, and how these practices structured interactions with Europeans. This work will serve as a comparative study against examples that focus on the links between surplus, storage, social development, and the transition to agriculture and animal husbandry.

For example, understanding what a dog is can involve information not only about how the dog looks and acts, but also about how it sounds, feels, and even smells. Consequently, one sense, such as hearing, can exert an influence on processing in another, such as vision. There has been some suggestion from prior research that this is why deaf children often struggle to process some types of visual information. However, this may not be due to a direct effect of lack of hearing on vision. Deaf children often have delayed exposure to language, which may also influence how children's visual processing develops. The effects of language exposure and auditory deprivation can be disentangled by studying deaf children who are exposed to a natural visual language - American Sign Language. This project will provide information about how hearing and language influence vision during development, and will also provide information about how deaf children come to learn about the world around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred and fifty deaf children aged 6-13 years, who vary in both their hearing loss and their exposure to American Sign Language, will be followed longitudinally for 2-3 years. During the first wave of data collection, each child's audiological profile, ASL skills and language background, and nonverbal IQ will be assessed. At each of four waves of data collection, their ability to process sequential streams of visual information will be measured.

One way in which languages differ is their use of stress and tone. English is a language which uses stress to distinguish word meanings: compare the word ""record"" when used as a verb (""to rec鐠愮d"") and as a noun (""the r閼煎崒ord""). Other languages use stress to mark the edges of words. Similar patterns are found with tone: in Tokyo Japanese, for instance, the meaning of the word ""hashi"" depends on the pitch melody with which it is spoken (with a high-low melody it means ""chopsticks"", and with a low-high melody it means ""bridge""). Languages which use just one of these features are very common. Less common, and less studied, are languages which use stress and tone together. Until such languages are studied in greater detail, we will not have a complete picture of the sound systems of human languages and the ways in which they can vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates stress and tone in Uspanteko, a highly endangered Mayan language spoken by approximately 1000-3000 people in the central highlands of Guatemala.

Alongside tone, stress is used in Uspanteko to mark the edges of words. The primary aim of this project is to document and analyze the acoustic structure of stress and tone in Uspanteko. As the sound system of Uspanteko is typologically unusual, this project has the potential to contribute substantially to our understanding of cross-linguistic variation in the areas of stress and tone.

This is of national concern because of the U.S. STEM workforce is vital to maintaining our status as a global leader and competitor. This research examines the role of gender and ethnic intergroup ideologies in creating an unwelcoming social climate in male-dominated STEM domains. These ideologies are prescriptive sociopolitical beliefs, such as the belief that men and women are naturally suited to do different jobs and they should stick to those areas alone. These beliefs influence attitudes and behaviors, and can result in a negative environment for learning and working.  These negative environments can reduce women's interest and persistence in STEM domains. This research crosses dimensions of intergroup perceptions, and examines novel hypotheses in several experiments and a longitudinal study. The proposed studies examine both the effect of experimentally manipulating the ideologies, as well as the effect of naturally occurring variation in ideology endorsement on the experiences of women and ethnic minorities in STEM fields. The goal is to understand factors that affect persistence in STEM fields, and ways to enhance persistence. Ultimately, this research could increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across four studies, gender ideology is manipulated experimentally to test whether (1) assimilation (women adapting their behaviors to a male-dominated environment) and segregation (men and women should stick to their areas of expertise) perspectives increase agreement with gendered math and science stereotypes, (2) these perspectives are particularly prevalent where they have the potential to do the most harm - among men in male-dominated STEM fields, and (3) the presence of such perspectives cause women to feel excluded and unwelcome. Two additional studies explore points of overlap and divergence in reactions to gender versus ethnic diversity messages. While women are predicted to respond most favorably to a gender blind perspective, past research shows that ethnic group members respond more positively to a multicultural perspective. Finally, a large-scale longitudinal study examines how naturally occurring variation in gender ideology endorsement relates in a prospective fashion to selecting an academic major. These studies will provide the basis for developing interventions aimed at gender and ethnic ideology beliefs in STEM environments, to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging. They will speak to how beliefs about group differences versus similarities contribute to students' decisions to pursue or avoid STEM majors and careers, and address points of overlap versus divergence in reactions by women versus ethnic students.

Much is known about the effects of illness on worker absenteeism and disability, but little is known about the effects of disease vulnerability on decision making, which can play a key role in quality of life and the nation's economic growth. This research examines the link between disease vulnerability due to immunological functioning or the environmental context and decision making with a series of studies. This research is based in a novel integration of theory and methods from several fields including psychoneuroimmunology, experimental social psychology, and evolutionary biology. It is easy to imagine that given a disease vulnerability one would engage in self-protective decisions and behaviors. However, by combining these theories the scientists arrive at an innovative and counterintuitive prediction. That is, instead of moving us toward safe decisions, vulnerability to disease that stems from environmental and immunological sources may actually lead to risky decisions. The findings of this research could be used to promote the physical health of our citizens, benefiting their well-being and our nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will test the hypothesis that greater vulnerability to pathogens and disease increase risky decision making. The research tests decision making in the context of biologically derived, immune-based vulnerabilities or perceived changes in the external pathogen load. To test the link between vulnerability and risky decisions, Dr. Sarah Hill, from Texas Christian University, and her colleagues, propose a multi-disciplinary correlational study that measures the relationship between multiple facets of peripheral blood-based immune function and decision-making. This first-of-its kind study will provide important new insights into whether key measures of immunological function predict risk-taking and its attitudinal and cognitive antecedents. Next, the researchers propose seven laboratory experiments in which they use an established priming procedure to experimentally induce perceived vulnerability to disease, and measure subsequent psychological and behavioral changes known to promote risky decision-making. The proposed research promises to offer important new theoretical advances to numerous fields including social, health, evolutionary, clinical, and personality psychology, decision making science, and psychoneuroimmunology.

Speaking is a complex, uniquely human ability that relies on precisely coordinated movements of the speech organs (tongue, lips, jaw, soft palate, and larynx) and respiratory system. These movements produce sounds that listeners perceive and that convey not only the 'dictionary' content of the utterance, but also its prosodic content. Prosody organizes phonological forms into successively larger units or phrases, and renders certain syllables, words and phrases more 'prominent' (perceptually or rhythmically important) to the listener. Understanding the processes that shape prosodic structure and how these processes act to transmit this structure through coordination of the speech organs has profound implications for advancing our understanding of language processing and communication disorders, for improving speech technology, and for providing insights regarding the more general relationship between linguistic and cognitive operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis examined in this collaborative project is that the control processes governing temporal and tonal structure are intimately linked with one another. This linkage is viewed as emerging from the underlying motor control dynamics that coordinate the motions of the speech organs and guide speech production. In order to investigate this hypothesis, two additional open questions are addressed concerning the nature of the units that exist at different prosodic and prominence levels, and the relationships among syllables, prosodic feet, words and phrases: ""What are the structural and articulatory-acoustic properties of prosodic feet?""; and ""How can the relationships among the levels be best understood?"" These questions are investigated through a series of articulatory studies--using electromagnetic articulography--and acoustic measurements that will examine: 1) how temporal and tonal properties interact at phrasal boundaries, 2) how temporal and tonal properties interact within and across all levels of prominence, and 3) how motor control dynamics shape the details of articulatory-acoustic structure at the foot level.

The researchers propose that a number of the properties of languages can be explained as design choices that maximize ease of communication for the human brain. Understanding how languages are (or aren't) optimized for communication will be crucial to developing scientific models of human language understanding and learning.  The resulting understanding of the purpose of certain language structures will enable more effective teaching of those structures in second language pedagogy. In addition, understanding why languages are the way they are will also affect computer systems for natural language understanding. Over the last decade there have been major advances in computer understanding of natural language, often using surprisingly simple algorithms. It is not known what properties of language make it possible to get so far with such simple algorithms. Once these properties are understood, it will be possible to leverage them to develop even more effective algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on predicting the quantitative word order properties of languages as observed in large annotated corpora of text. Data comes from the Universal Dependencies project, a recent collaboration of several universities and Google to develop uniformly annotated dependency-parsed corpora for about 40 languages. The researchers will develop simple models of communication that incorporate the probability of error in communication and certain well-known points of difficulty in human language comprehension (due to factors such as limited working memory resources). The frequency distribution of different word orders in the dependency corpora will be modeled by assuming that approximately rational speakers selects utterances which have a high probability of being understood. The researchers aim to use these models to explain the distribution of dependency length (distance between syntactically related words) and the distribution of the degree of word order freedom (the extent to which words can appear in different orders while keeping the same meaning).",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4FsWE64AAAAJ,"['Psycholinguistics', 'Language Processing', 'Sentence Processing', 'Syntax', 'Semantics']",26243,68,341,440,586,572,538,661,886,950,960,1269,1189,1364,1623,1595,1458,1499,1713,235,274,429,1817,1983,2156,168

More mundane forms of intergroup aggression such as political conflicts pervade everyday life, and as a consequence may be at least as costly in total impact on the economy. Although individuals can be motivated to harm others because of personal as well as inter-group conflict, motivation to harm that originates from intergroup contexts may be especially dangerous. Such motivation can increase aggression because it allows harm to be justified as being morally necessary in the absence of any personal grievance. Moreover, the desire to aggress against one out-group member may generalize to their entire group.  Thus, the motivation to aggress is especially important to understand as it unfolds in social groups. The investigator Mina Cikara (Harvard University) proposes that feeling pleasure in response to out-group pain is a natural response that makes it easier to learn a behavior which is otherwise repugnant to individuals: actively doing harm to others.  If observing the pain of out-group members is consistently linked with feeling pleasure, people may learn over time to support and even act out in harmful ways toward out-group targets. This project takes a novel, interdisciplinary approach to understanding these questions by integrating social and cognitive psychology. This project also addresses a major gap in knowledge regarding the emergence and escalation of intergroup aggression, and can provide insights that enhance national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model tested in this project posits that the capacity for intergroup aggression may have developed partly through basic learning principles. That is, basic reinforcement-learning processes that couple feeling pleasure and out-group pain may help people overcome a natural aversion to hurting others. A series of experiments using political, national, and ethnic identities test whether competitive out-groups (relative to in-group and neutral out-groups) are more likely to be targeted with aggression. The experimental contexts include an extended sequence of interactions and they test whether aggression escalates over the course of the interaction. Further experiments test whether aggression is reduced if learning is disrupted. This learning disruption takes place through either negative social feedback from in-group members or when each aggressive action requires evaluating the associated costs and benefits. This project builds on classic and contemporary theories of learning. As such, it makes several points of contact with other areas of scientific inquiry including behavioral neuroscience, economics, and biology, and with the knowledge gained from studying other animals. The results of this project have the potential to inform focused and inexpensive cognitive behavioral interventions to attenuate intergroup aggression.

The study will track whether and how youth become civically engaged over time. The project will explore how civic engagement relates to other developing capacities and to the family, school, and geographical contexts in which youth are developing.

How do children acquiring their first language figure what we are then discussing, when mere possibilities, unlike apples or naps, cannot be directly observed? And how do they come to use words, such as the modals ""may"" and ""must"", that are dedicated to saying what is possible or likely? This project pursues these developmental puzzles by probing how the use of modal words by children either matches or differs from that of their caregivers. The results will provide insights into two broader issues. What are the natural and unnatural ways of expressing possibility in human languages? And do the errors that children make sometimes lead to changes in modal language over time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be the most comprehensive linguistic study of modal development to date and will include both a series of behavioral experiments, and a corpus study of naturalistic speech between children and their caregivers. The experiments build on generalizations from studies of how modals change their meanings over time in the history of a language, and how they vary across languages. By exploiting this integration of theories of linguistic meaning and child development with theories of language change and variation, the project will bridge communities of researchers that are too seldom in contact. Outreach events supported by this project will enable high school students to participate in linguistic research on the language of possibility. Languages and dialects vary in how they talk about possibility, but also exhibit a common foundation.

Their task is extremely complex. They must come to perceive countless gestures or sounds as having the structure of sentences, with subjects, verbs, and so on. At the same time, they must come to understand how these sentences depict the world around them, as it is lived and portrayed by their caretakers and peers. How do they do this? Answering this question requires understanding how they experience both the language and the world around them, at each stage of their development. This research aims at one central part of the problem: how do infants learn the meanings of transitive verbs, those with a subject and object?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project approaches the problem from two directions. First, can children younger than 2 correctly perceive the category of 'transitive verb'? This may be difficult, because such verbs may occur in a variety of contexts that obscure their category, such as questions where the direct object occurs at the start of the sentence: ""What did Mary see?"" Second, how do children at this age tend to represent the events around them? Which aspects of an event are or are not salient to them? With some answers to both questions, the project moves on to asking what expectations children have about the connection between the syntax of transitive verbs and their meanings, expectations that might help them learn. This research will deepen our understanding of the relation between linguistic and nonlinguistic representations, and how these change in the early stages of language development.  Moreover, this work employs methods not previously used in research on the acquisition of syntax, expanding the range of methods available for others. Significant effort will also be directed towards outreach events in which graduate and undergraduate students working on the project will engage with high school and middle school students about the importance of linguistic research in general, and about the broader societal lessons that can be drawn from research on infant language learners.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=HchqLGsAAAAJ,"['language acquisition', 'psycholinguistics', 'syntax', 'semantics']",6997,47,101,93,176,198,245,227,246,274,211,287,352,415,428,481,467,415,449,24,24,59,498,571,469,29

These movements produce sounds that listeners perceive and that convey not only the 'dictionary' content of the utterance, but also its prosodic content. Prosody organizes phonological forms into successively larger units or phrases, and renders certain syllables, words and phrases more 'prominent' (perceptually or rhythmically important) to the listener.

In each community, within a few years and with high accuracy, children learn the language of their environment. Achieving high proficiency in at least one language is critical for learning the culture of the community, connecting with peers, and accessing an education. When language is delayed, other aspects of development may also be at risk. Studying how language develops in children is therefore of great importance, both for understanding how language interacts with other systems, and for identifying and diagnosing language delays. Although children learn language quickly, they continue to make some errors well after they achieve high proficiency in their first language. These errors, because they are so rare, provide useful insights into the mechanisms of language development. Many of the general cognitive processes proposed to interact with language in adults are known to develop much later than language, raising the question: to what extent are children's linguistic errors due to extra-linguistic processes, rather than incomplete linguistic knowledge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses children's understanding of adjunct control, as in ""John bumped Mary after tripping on the sidewalk,"" as a case study to investigate this question. For this sentence, adults only access a meaning in which John tripped, while children have been reported to exhibit a much wider range of interpretations, in which John, Mary or anyone tripped. All accounts to date of adjunct control in children have cited incomplete knowledge as the source of children's interpretations; this research pursues an alternative account--that children's knowledge is complete, but the extra-linguistic processing mechanisms are more error-prone in children than in adults, masking children's knowledge in contexts with a high processing load. Based on the manipulations used with similar types of sentences in adult sentence processing, this research investigates the effects of processing load on children's interpretations of sentences with adjunct control. At stake is a more continuous account that relates children's errors for adjunct control to parallel effects in adults, and presents the opportunity for future research to investigate other sentence types, the development of processing mechanisms, and how immature processing mechanisms affect language development.

One way in which languages differ is their use of stress and tone. English is a language which uses stress to distinguish word meanings: compare the word ""record"" when used as a verb (""to rec鐠愮d"") and as a noun (""the r閼煎崒ord""). Other languages use stress to mark the edges of words. Similar patterns are found with tone: in Tokyo Japanese, for instance, the meaning of the word ""hashi"" depends on the pitch melody with which it is spoken (with a high-low melody it means ""chopsticks"", and with a low-high melody it means ""bridge""). Languages which use just one of these features are very common. Less common, and less studied, are languages which use stress and tone together. Until such languages are studied in greater detail, we will not have a complete picture of the sound systems of human languages and the ways in which they can vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates stress and tone in Uspanteko, a highly endangered Mayan language spoken by approximately 1000-3000 people in the central highlands of Guatemala.

Alongside tone, stress is used in Uspanteko to mark the edges of words. The primary aim of this project is to document and analyze the acoustic structure of stress and tone in Uspanteko. As the sound system of Uspanteko is typologically unusual, this project has the potential to contribute substantially to our understanding of cross-linguistic variation in the areas of stress and tone.

Although the components of the masticatory (chewing) system are known to work together as a unit, previous analyses of this system have typically examined specific components in isolation from the rest of the anatomy, providing an incomplete picture of anatomical interrelationships. This project will address how the different anatomical components are correlated with each other across the entire masticatory system, in the context of changes that may occur during the lifetime of an individual, such as normal and pathological dental wear, and normal and abnormal (e.g. arthritis) changes in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) shape. Quantifying anatomical correlations using three-dimensional modeling in the dentition and TMJ will allow for new interpretations of the skeletal masticatory system and an improved understanding of the evolutionary pressures associated with different feeding behaviors and diets across primates. Determining whether TMJ pathology covaries with dental wear and pathology in multiple non-human species will provide an evolutionary context for dental and TMJ disorders that are very common in humans. The broader impacts of this research include encouraging gender and ethnic diversity in science by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students at universities that primarily educate first generation college and minority students; supporting the research of three early career female scientists; training a postdoctoral researcher in advanced techniques for capturing and analyzing shape variation; building a large database of 3D data that will be available to both anthropological and biomedical researchers and that may inform clinical studies of dental problems in humans; and conducting community outreach that will further disseminate the results of this investigation and help generate public interest in STEM research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because changes in diet and subsistence patterns often lie at the root of major evolutionary shifts, documenting and understanding the adaptive significance of the masticatory system during human evolution, as well as across living primates, has been a major goal of functional morphological studies in biological anthropology. The masticatory system acts as a single functional unit, such that perturbations in one portion of this system may affect other regions of anatomy; thus, age-related changes and pathological conditions of the masticatory apparatus are likely to be multifactorial and affect the entire system. Through a detailed assessment of dental and TMJ morphology and covariance between the dentition and the TMJ, this study examines both normal and pathological dental wear and TMJ remodeling in 16 anthropoid primate taxa, including humans. The specific aims include testing for covariation between the maxillary and mandibular teeth, the cranial and mandibular components of the TMJ, the teeth and TMJ, and dental and TMJ pathologies. Shape variation in the dentition and TMJ will be quantified using advanced morphometric techniques, including 3D landmark and surface data. Specimens will be assessed for pathology using published criteria for antemortem tooth loss, tooth wear, pulp cavity exposure, and TMJ osteoarthritis. By determining whether TMJ pathology covaries with dental wear and pathology in humans and non-human primates, this research will provide an evolutionary context for the evolution of primate feeding behaviors and of TMJ disorders in humans.

If emotions are intensely experienced it may be easy to tell, but some people are good at hiding their emotions, or they may be unaware of or unable to report what they are feeling. Fortunately, technological advances in measuring brain activity and emotion theory can help us to have a more objective understanding of people's emotional states. Some theories of emotion suggest that different emotional states, such as fear, anger, or happiness, arise because of specific, dedicated neural circuitry that responds in the same way any time that emotion is experienced. For example, the circuitry for happiness is the same whether it arises because you get a compliment or you learned of a promotion. In contrast, the proposed research is built on an innovative 'situated neuroscience' model of emotions. This model hypothesizes that emotions correspond to variable neural patterns. These variable patterns are hypothesized to be determined by the emotion category experienced, such as fear, and partly by the context in which the emotion is experienced. The context includes components from culture and the situation itself. Dr. Kristen Lindquist, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and colleagues proposed three experiments to examine this model. Her research will use measures of the location of brain events (functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) and the timing of brain events (electroencephalography; EEG). The integration of emotion theory and technology in this way could help to improve communication about and understanding of emotions, help us to predict when emotions influence our decisions and performance, and may have benefits for the way we interact with others.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research integrates emotion theory with technological advances in measuring brain activity to ""read"" emotional feelings from brain states. The aim is to develop a situated neuroscience of emotion that will inform our understanding of the basis of emotions and their conscious experience. Three experiments are proposed that examine the role of situational and cultural contexts in emotion and brain activity. The first experiment examines fear and anger and their interaction with situational and cultural contexts on brain activity, using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). The situation is manipulated to be either social or non-social, and culture stems from enrolling natives of the US and China who know the emotion-based norms and values of their respective culture.  The second experiment extends this investigation to the temporal dynamics of emotional brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). The third study uses machine learning on data obtained from the prior experiments to determine which variables best predict brain activity during emotion, in the different contexts. Understanding the situated nature of emotion is crucial to an understanding of how neural circuits map on to subjective mental states. These findings may improve our understanding of emotional experience in ourselves and others, and enhance our communication, well-being, and diplomatic relations.

In 460 BCE, Herodotus reported that two children, isolated from language and raised in a cabin, began to speak Phrygian. His conclusion was that Phrygian must be the first human language. In modern linguistics, the idea of an innate Universal Grammar that is hardwired in the human brain has had a major impact on the field. If the Forbidden Experiment, as described by Herodotus, were performed now, what might we learn about the origins of language or about language universals? What structures would emerge as resilient properties of human communication that require little or no input? We cannot perform this experiment, but we can look to situations in which children are deprived of natural language. Deaf children with no access to spoken or signed language often develop 'home sign systems'.

Sleep also plays a very important role in learning and memory.  Sleep helps babies to solidify newly learned information in their memories, a process known as consolidation. The goal of this project is to study the role of sleep in motor learning -- acquiring a new skill involving physical coordination of movement. The results will provide important insights into how the timing and quality of sleep infants experience influences their ability to consolidate new motor learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work bridges three areas of research: cognitive development, motor development, and sleep. Infants who have just begun walking independently will learn to complete a tunnel navigation task.  Following the task, infants will experience a delay during which some will nap and others will not. The impact of napping on learning will then be assessed. A sleep monitor (actigraph) will be employed to assess individual differences in quality of sleep and how sleep quality relates to learning. Measures of sleep prior to training and on the following night will permit investigation of the unique contributions of day and night sleep to infant learning. This study will be the first to directly examine sleep and motor learning in infancy, the first to study the contribution of night sleep on infant motor learning, and the first to examine whether individual differences in the quality of sleep mediates the effect of sleep on learning. The proposed research will ultimately provide guidelines for balancing between enriched learning experiences and a protective environment that promotes rest and regulation.

Children who learn two or more languages exhibit what appear to be lifelong cognitive advantages relative to those who learn only one language.  In particular, bilingual children show heightened cognitive flexibility, defined as the ability to adjust their behaviors in response to changes in task demands, and inhibit their attention to irrelevant information.  Cognitive flexibility is critical to educational success.  The proposed studies will examine whether advantages in memory processing during infancy can explain bilingual children's heightened cognitive flexibility later in childhood. A better understanding of how and why bilingualism enhances cognitive flexibility will allow educators to develop pedagogical strategies to capitalize on bilingualism's protective cognitive strengths. This may be especially important for bilingual children from low income families who show an achievement gap relative to their middle class, monolingual peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Memory inference and memory flexibility will be tested in 1- and 2-year-old monolingual and bilingual children and these same children will be tested at 3- and 5-years on cognitive flexibility. Memory flexibility involves the ability to recognize similarities between objects based on how they function rather than how they look, which involves the ability to shift between cues. Memory interference occurs when competing cues disrupt memory encoding, and reduction of interference requires inhibition of conflicting cues.  It is predicted that longitudinal analyses will show that bilingual infants have greater memory flexibility and less memory interference than monolinguals, which will predict enhanced cognitive flexibility at both 3 and 5 years.  In addition, the PI is committed to training graduate and undergraduate students and will recruit bilingual students for their unique linguistic skills; the project is therefore likely to train minority students who are underrepresented in STEM fields.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2nTFk0sAAAAJ,,9325,51,83,71,128,157,170,186,288,223,241,381,390,374,449,509,533,705,779,21,75,65,963,1059,1066,96

Although the components of the masticatory (chewing) system are known to work together as a unit, previous analyses of this system have typically examined specific components in isolation from the rest of the anatomy, providing an incomplete picture of anatomical interrelationships. This project will address how the different anatomical components are correlated with each other across the entire masticatory system, in the context of changes that may occur during the lifetime of an individual, such as normal and pathological dental wear, and normal and abnormal (e.g. arthritis) changes in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) shape. Quantifying anatomical correlations using three-dimensional modeling in the dentition and TMJ will allow for new interpretations of the skeletal masticatory system and an improved understanding of the evolutionary pressures associated with different feeding behaviors and diets across primates. Determining whether TMJ pathology covaries with dental wear and pathology in multiple non-human species will provide an evolutionary context for dental and TMJ disorders that are very common in humans. The broader impacts of this research include encouraging gender and ethnic diversity in science by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students at universities that primarily educate first generation college and minority students; supporting the research of three early career female scientists; training a postdoctoral researcher in advanced techniques for capturing and analyzing shape variation; building a large database of 3D data that will be available to both anthropological and biomedical researchers and that may inform clinical studies of dental problems in humans; and conducting community outreach that will further disseminate the results of this investigation and help generate public interest in STEM research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because changes in diet and subsistence patterns often lie at the root of major evolutionary shifts, documenting and understanding the adaptive significance of the masticatory system during human evolution, as well as across living primates, has been a major goal of functional morphological studies in biological anthropology. The masticatory system acts as a single functional unit, such that perturbations in one portion of this system may affect other regions of anatomy; thus, age-related changes and pathological conditions of the masticatory apparatus are likely to be multifactorial and affect the entire system. Through a detailed assessment of dental and TMJ morphology and covariance between the dentition and the TMJ, this study examines both normal and pathological dental wear and TMJ remodeling in 16 anthropoid primate taxa, including humans. The specific aims include testing for covariation between the maxillary and mandibular teeth, the cranial and mandibular components of the TMJ, the teeth and TMJ, and dental and TMJ pathologies. Shape variation in the dentition and TMJ will be quantified using advanced morphometric techniques, including 3D landmark and surface data. Specimens will be assessed for pathology using published criteria for antemortem tooth loss, tooth wear, pulp cavity exposure, and TMJ osteoarthritis. By determining whether TMJ pathology covaries with dental wear and pathology in humans and non-human primates, this research will provide an evolutionary context for the evolution of primate feeding behaviors and of TMJ disorders in humans. The research has public health relevance, given the high prevalence of antemortem tooth loss and TMJ disorders in modern human populations.

Important decisions about another person are often based on first impressions. Impressions can include the emotional state a person is feeling at that moment, or ""affect"", and how that person generally thinks and acts: his or her personality traits. Making accurate judgments has vital effects on the actions people take. Judging that a person's affect is positive or negative allows people to decide whether approach or avoidance is best at that moment. Accurately judging traits is useful for the ""who"" and ""how"" of social living. People determine whom to approach with what goal in mind, and they anticipate how such interactions might unfold. Making good decisions in a variety of contexts is likely to lead to quality relationships or collaborations and avoidance of negative ones. This, in turn, may increase well-being, employee satisfaction, and productivity. Although accurately judging both affect and stable traits is crucial to making high quality decisions, researchers have developed models of these two kinds of judgments independent of each other. The current project provides an innovative merging of these areas of research, producing a model of how accuracy across these judgment areas may be related. The investigators will test the newly developed State and Trait Accuracy Model in four experiments. In addition, the project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and engagement in science for students in primary schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests two hypotheses about the relationship and causal direction of people's accuracy in judging affect and judging traits. The State and Trait Accuracy Model predicts a positive relationship between such judgments, and further predicts that judgments of affect precede accurate judgments of personality traits. To test hypotheses about the accuracy of judging strangers, it is essential to have stimuli that display genuine emotions and responses, rather than staged or artificial affective displays. Thus, researchers from the three universities involved in this project have developed a validated database of stimuli consisting of videotapes of individuals whose personality traits and emotional state have been assessed. In the current project, experiments will use segments of these videotapes as stimuli for observers to make affect and trait judgments. Four experiments involve manipulating observers' judgmental focus and manipulating the validity of affect and trait information, either by mislabeling or by natural incongruences. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved as researchers and participants in the project, providing research training opportunities. Children in local primary schools will benefit by exposure to presentations and research design experiences provided in their schools. Another benefit of this project is that the infrastructure for research is enhanced via this collaboration of researchers at three North American universities. In addition, society can benefit from an increased understanding of how affective states and personality traits can be judged more accurately--something useful to people in daily life as well as to professionals.

For example, in the recent recession, Black Americans had a decrease in household wealth that was much greater than that of Whites. Although widening disparities that occur during recessions are frequently explained in terms of existing structural inequalities, recent findings by Amy R. Krosch, in collaboration with the investigator David M. Amodio, suggests  a psychological basis for disparities. Their work indicates that perception of economic scarcity affects visual perception processes such that those from minority racial groups are perceived as more stereotypical in appearance, and in turn, as less deserving of resources. Such findings suggest that economic events can threaten intergroup relations and increase discrimination, putting particular groups at acute risk. However, the psychological mechanisms by which these macroeconomic factors affect racial perceptions is not understood. Understanding such mechanisms is essential for developing ways to reduce the effects of economic scarcity on prejudice and discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project focuses on key sociocognitive mechanisms through which perceptions of economic scarcity cause biased visual perceptions of individuals from racial minority groups. In a series of eight experiments, the investigator tests the hypothesis that perceived scarcity induces not only stereotyping, but dehumanization processes as well: reduced tendency to infer uniquely human-like traits and emotions from a face and to neurally encode it as a human face. Experiments test whether these processes directly bias perceivers' visual representations of individuals from racial minority groups, which, in turn, propagates behavioral discrimination. This research builds on both classic and novel theories of how economic factors influence intergroup relations, and it makes innovative use of behavioral, neuroscientific, and psychophysical methodologies to examine the visual processing of race.

Linguists have identified many of the ways English fits who, what, and whom into a sentence, but it is still unclear why different rules apply to different sentences. But the language system is far more complex than this example suggests. English has about 150 different ways of fitting who, what, and whom into a sentence. Consider the sentence ""Agnes received the package from Bart"" in which the subject of the sentence (Agnes) gets the package. In contrast, in ""Agnes gave the package to Bart,"" Agnes is still the subject of the sentence but she doesn't get the package. We might also say ""Agnes tore at the package"" or ""Agnes looked at the package"" but ""Agnes saw at the package"" doesn't work.

Archaeology is particularly well suited to make significant contributions to this effort because it can study complex societies over extended periods through the analysis of material remains. However, archaeologists have tended to emphasize coercion over cooperation in reconstructing early states, despite evidence that leaders and their subjects tend to negotiate the terms of institutionalized political authority. With these ideas in mind, this project will examine the processes through which people living in rural communities cooperated with, acted independently of, or contested the mechanisms of social control instituted by leaders at political centers. The research is significant because it moves beyond simply identifying social complexity in the past by addressing why different states followed historical paths, thereby contributing to models that describe how leaders and followers participated in developing, maintaining, reproducing and reworking complex polities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, research in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, an area that extends from central Mexico to El Salvador, examines political integration in early states from a ""top-down"" perspective that focuses on the strategies leaders employed to centralize and sustain their authority. Implicit in these models is the assumption that rural communities were populated by commoners whose sole purpose was to provision urban consumption at the behest of polity rulers. An alternative, ""bottom-up"" perspective that examines political integration from the view of rural communities is needed to rigorously test what causes centralized polities to form, persist, and collapse. This project addresses the problem by examining the organization of a complex polity that emerged in the lower R闁惧攷 Verde Valley of coastal Oaxaca, Mexico during the Terminal Formative period (150 BCE-CE 250). The lower Verde's first state developed by CE 100, with its primary center located at the site of Rio Viejo. Current evidence suggests that the Rio Viejo state was unstable, as the polity collapsed by CE 250, and the region's population dispersed into small settlements. This study explores the degree to which rulers at Rio Viejo maintained control over outlying areas by conducting field research at Cerro de la Virgen, a rural community located in the valley's hinterland. Cerro de la Virgen is ideal for examining negotiations between outlying communities and Rio Viejo because the site persisted through the social upheaval at the end of the Formative period. The project involves four months of excavation and laboratory analyses aimed at determining whether political, economic, and religious resources were controlled at the local or the regional level. Excavations will target public and domestic architecture to examine resource control within communal and household settings, and archaeometric analyses will provide multiple tests of the hypothesis that the R闁惧攷 Viejo state collapsed because its leaders failed to integrate rural populations into the broader political system.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1fB4rgcAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'ecology', 'quaternary sciences', 'politics']",3059,31,37,56,69,80,76,72,82,147,183,176,153,204,190,243,155,199,216,46,22,34,144,158,101,18

Every day we comprehend hundreds of sentences that we hear or read but have never encountered before, and we produce hundreds more. Yet our success at these many acts of communication belies the difficulty of the task: language is rife with ambiguity, our attention is limited, our environments may be noisy, and we often have incomplete information about the shared knowledge and beliefs of the people we engage with. This ability, unique to our species, poses profound challenges for our scientific understanding of the capabilities of the human mind.  Deepening our understanding of these capabilities requires a combination of ideas and methods from linguistics, psychology, and computer science.

Many of these lexical items are individual words, but there is evidence that specific, frequent multi-word expressions, such as ""meat and potatoes"" or ""large majority"" may also get stored in the lexicon. This project combines artificial intelligence-based computational models, large linguistic datasets, and controlled psychological experimentation to explore the edge of the lexicon, probing how direct experience with specific multi-word expressions leads to their being stored in one's mental lexicon, how such storage is reconciled with productive knowledge in language comprehension and production, and how these expressions emerge and change over time.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=i86O0SAAAAAJ,"['Computational Psycholinguistics', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Sentence Processing', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computational Pragmatics']",23552,52,,,60,68,109,166,239,258,332,622,822,1180,1506,1679,1859,2141,2507,,,,2938,2985,3337,309

Previous research has identified differences in the way that the native language is processed that may contribute to the trajectory of new language learning (i.e., fast and slow language learners), and that may also be affected by how speakers recruit various aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, pattern abstraction) when processing their native language. This project will examine how these differences in skilled language processing predict the trajectory of new language learning, as well as whether the differences are related to variation in non-language abilities. Bilingual speakers, who already have experience with learning a new language and who do not use either language exactly as monolingual speakers do, have previously been found to be better at acquiring new languages, but bilinguals differ from each other in many ways that affect their language learning outcomes. This project will compare both monolingual and bilingual speakers in how they process their skilled languages and how they learn new languages. Behavioral methods and brain potentials will be used to determine whether the brain reflects some learning processes that are not apparent in behavior alone. The bilinguals tested will be typical college students who are taking advanced foreign language classes, as well as heritage Spanish speakers who are raised in Spanish-speaking homes but then educated in English. These two groups of bilinguals represent language experiences that American citizens often encounter themselves, while the monolingual groups will be recruited from parts of the United States that differ in the levels of ambient exposure to foreign languages.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZvDiAQEAAAAJ,"['cognitive psychology', 'psycholinguistics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'bilingualism', 'second language learning']",26763,70,276,422,370,482,687,636,800,977,1139,1116,1300,1536,1621,1485,1664,1644,1845,200,390,357,2128,1740,1842,186

To understand what people say, one listens both to what is said and what is ""unsaid"". If there is a plate of 5 cookies on the table and a child eats them all and then tells her sister who made them, ""I ate some of the cookies."" the child is not strictly speaking lying. Notice that if one eats all of the cookies on a plate, it is also true that one has eaten some of the cookies on that plate. This ""some, and possibly all"" interpretation is given by the logic of what is said, while the ""some, but not all"" interpretation is considered to be a part of meaning that is unsaid and is appropriate in some contexts, but not others. Understanding when each of these two interpretations is called for is thought to be a question of which part of the mind is being put to use. The part of the mind that is dedicated to language only is thought to be responsible for the ""some, and possibly all"" interpretation, while higher order reasoning--not specific to language--is thought to be responsible for the ""some, but not all"" interpretation. When are children able to grasp this relatively subtle difference in language use? If science could find a moment in their mental developmental when they understand one, but not the other, it would constitute evidence of which parts of the mind develop more quickly than others. Further, do children who are known to have severe language problems show evidence of understanding one kind of interpretation and not the other? If so, not only would there be evidence of distinct developmental timelines for distinct parts of the mind, there might also be a way of identifying children with these disorders early so that they could receive therapeutic services to help them learn to cope with their language problem.<br/><br/>This study tests a sample of children who speak Spanish as a first language, because the difference between the types of meaning is clearer in Spanish than in many languages, as a result of there being a word with only the ""some and possibly all"" meaning (""unos"") and another word for that can have either meaning (""algunos""). This project will examine what both typically-developing children and children with the developmental language deficit labeled Specific Language Impairment know about these constructions. Preschool-aged children with this language disorder are very likely to receive a dyslexia diagnosis once they reach school age. Consequently, one aim of this study is to identify differences--in terms of their knowledge of this aspect of language--between children who have language problems and those who do not, as a means for diagnosing language problems early in child development.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ELzORT4AAAAJ,['Developmental Linguistics'],1124,16,25,14,35,38,27,61,52,48,40,63,80,37,59,49,67,44,49,13,18,31,85,62,86,3

A better understanding of these relationships is important not only for human biologists interested in childhood growth and life history patterns, but for bioarchaeologists and forensic anthropologists who want more accurate estimates of age at death in skeletal samples. NSF funds will support data collection and statistical consulting for the dental portion of the larger project. The project will result in freely accessible dental and skeletal data for a large, cross-sectional sample of modern children. An age estimation software program, and workshops to introduce the software, will also be developed and will be of interest across a range of research areas within and beyond anthropology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subadult age estimations are based on documented patterns of growth and development and are considered the most accurate estimation in the subadult biological profile. However, the major limitations of subadult age estimation are the lack of large, modern skeletal reference samples and the reliance on historical, primarily univariate methodological approaches. Most methods utilize a bone-by-bone or tooth-by-tooth approach and do not provide a means to incorporate markers from the entire subadult skeleton. In this project, the investigators will have access to de-identified medical examiner data.

They can choose from a variety of strategies to delineate the location of an object, using for instance the directions where the sun rises/sets, projecting their own body axes onto the object, or introducing another object as landmark. These descriptions provide an opportunity to probe into the way people think and talk about space as a cultural practice shared among the members of a speech community. Linguists and psychologists are particularly interested in the factors that influence the selection among such strategies. Language, cultural factors such as education and literacy, and environmental variables such as topography and population geography have all been hypothesized to play a potential role in this process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical but understudied question in this connection is the impact of bilingualism. If the language a person speaks influences how they represent space cognitively, then speakers of multiple languages might think in ways that differ from how monolinguals think. Such hypothetical effects offer an opportunity to gain rich and detailed information about the role of language in cognition. This project focuses on Taiwan to explore the effect of language, culture and environment on the way monolingual and bilingual speakers represent space in language and cognition. Due to its migration history, Taiwan can be considered a natural linguistic laboratory with a great amount of variation among bilingual speakers in terms of age, education and residential neighborhoods. The test languages, Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Southern Min, a distant cousin of Mandarin, exhibit very distinct features and practices of use in spatial reference.

These verbal conflicts are common between both acquaintances and strangers. Some of these conflicts quickly end with one party standing down, but others escalate verbally to physical, even fatal, fights. What role do vocal qualities (not what people say, but physical aspects of the voice) play in determining whether a verbal dispute becomes a fight? Research on other animals indicates that vocal qualities often give information about physical strength and aggressive intentions, which can predict fight outcomes and thus affect an individual's motivation to fight. For example, previous research shows that men with lower pitched voices are judged as being more likely to win fistfights than men with less deep voices. In this case, pitch is a way to manipulate ""signal intensity"", which evolutionary theory suggests would convey important cues useful to a potential attacker.  An intense signal conveys the speaker is more motivated to aggress or is physically stronger than would a weaker signal. Theory suggests that the listener's likelihood of retreating or attacking should be affected by perceptions of the voice, but research has not yet tested those hypotheses in humans. Thus this project builds on previous findings about perceiving voices, to extend it to people's preparation to aggress. The investigators use experiments to create mildly competitive situations and examine whether signal speaker's vocal features affects listeners' aggressive inclinations. Understanding how vocal qualities can reduce or increase aggression will help professionals who are regularly exposed to violence (e.g., police officers) to navigate danger, and inform intervention programs that aim at curtailing violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests key hypotheses drawn from M.

Interactions of the three manipulated variables are predicted to affect listener's judgments about aggressive intent. Experiment Set 2 will test how listeners' physical strength and cues of competition for mates influence their attention to and memory of the speaker.

Less is known about prosocial behaviors among adolescents, such as sharing and supportiveness.   How do changes in the adolescent brain relate to the development of these more positive behaviors? And how does adolescents' tendency to engage in positive behaviors vary depending upon the social context? This project brings together a team of developmental and social psychologists and neuroscientists to study how one particular aspect of prosocial behavior, giving to others, changes across adolescence, and how brain changes relate to the age-related changes in prosocial behavior.   One specific goal is to explore whether giving behaviors become more sensitive to the situation (such as the recipient and the cost of giving) across development. Another goal is to understand the involvement of different brain systems (such as those responsible for processing rewards and inhibiting impulsive behaviors) in giving behaviors. A final goal is to understand how other social skills such as perspective-taking and empathy relate to giving and brain developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 120 participants at 9, 14, and 19 years of age will participate in an experimental giving task while having their brains scanned in an MRI machine. They also will complete questionnaires and daily checklists that assess social experience, perspective-taking, empathy, and values. Giving to friends and strangers is expected to increase and decrease, respectively, and giving to family will remain stable across the years of adolescence. This differential giving should correlate with greater activation and connectivity among neural networks associated with reward, mentalizing, and cognitive control when giving to friends as compared to family and strangers, and when giving to family as compared to strangers. Differential giving and neural activation according to recipient is expected to be linked with greater valuing and orientation toward peers and family, and individual differences among participants in overall giving and activation will be correlated with social experience, perspective-taking, and empathy.

Understanding how aspects of students' daily experiences relate to achievement is important in reducing this gap. This study focuses on adolescents' day-to-day experiences of discrimination -based on race/ethnicity, social class, weight, and/or sexual orientation- that may contribute to achievement disparities.

Recent fossil discoveries, including from Lomekwi, have revealed more hominin diversity than was previously known for that time period. Furthermore, stone tools were recently discovered at Lomekwi, predating the origin of our genus Homo by over one half million years. This fieldwork will help uncover who the first toolmakers were and if there was something special about the environment of the region that spawned species diversity or the advance in technological behavior. The project will strengthen international collaborative ties between the United States and Kenya, and educate students from both countries working together in paleontology and public outreach. The project will bring journalism students, education specialists and scientists together to collaborate in developing middle school and high school teaching materials on human prehistory and science designed to meet Next Generation educational standards for national distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paleontological research at Lomekwi is aimed at recovering more hominin fossils (3.5-3.3 Ma) and characterizing their paleoecological context. Until recently, the only known middle Pliocene hominin was Australopithecus afarensis, and hominin diversity appeared to have blossomed only later. With additional fossil data, it now appears that more than one hominin, and perhaps several, coexisted in the mid-Pliocene, most notably Kenyanthropus platyops from Lomekwi. Also, the recent announcement of 3.3 Ma stone tools from Lomekwi suggests that at least some pre-Homo hominins had more advanced material culture earlier than previously imagined. The appearance of stone tools and hominin diversity raises fundamental questions about local and regional environmental and/or biogeographic factors that may have influenced hominins in West Turkana in the mid-Pliocene.  Finding more fossils at Lomekwi stands to reveal how many hominins were present at that time, whether K. platyops is indeed a valid taxon, who the Lomekwian tool makers may have been, and what paleoenvironmental factors may have influenced their diversity and behavior.

High-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, geospatial data, and field-measured vegetation characteristics will be integrated to determine the most important factors contributing to spatial variability in the filtering of carbon particulates.  A statistical model will be developed to provide estimates of carbon removal by trees at the city scale.

The investigator whose work will be supported will investigate the drivers and consequences of these ecological and political changes for the conservation of biodiversity and sustainability of socioeconomic livelihoods.  The project will provide valuable new kinds of basic knowledge.  By structuring the research to account for the different ways in rangelands are managed, the investigator will be able to assess degree to which as well as how wildlife and livestock share the same spaces.  The project will embrace both human and animal individual and group behaviors to clarify the nature of wildlife-livestock relationships, because existing understandings underestimate the role of grazing actions among both wild and domestic grazers.  The results of this research will have a direct bearing on conservation and development policies around the world. New knowledge will be generated to aid in decision making regarding where, when, and under which contexts resource managers might encourage mixed use strategies with respect to livestock and wildlife grazing. These practices have the potential to increase the overall resilience and sustainability of drylands around the Earth.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for students to enhance critical thinking and problem solving skills through experiential learning. The project will enable tourists visiting rangeland protected areas to obtain more accurate and relevant information regarding people and natural systems in and around parks.  The project also is expected to provide new information and insights regarding ways to avoid entrenched pro-livestock or pro-biodiversity positions, thereby reducing the large economic and ecological costs of these positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rangelands are home to millions of livestock keeping pastoralists and sustaining large densities and distributions of wildlife.  More recently, the resilience of rangeland protected areas is being threatened because of changes in where both wildlife and domestic livestock can graze, and the physical effects of grazing.  Changes in seasonality have further constrained the resiliency of drylands.  Current understandings about how people, wildlife, and livestock interact in rangelands have been devoid of appropriate social, political, and ecological contexts.  As a result, there is limited knowledge about the interactions between wildlife and pastoralists' livestock inside rangeland protected areas.  In order to better understand these dynamics, the investigator will evaluate how different management regimes influences patterns of wildlife and livestock resource use.  He will determine the magnitude and extent to which resource patterns are influenced by both human and animal behaviors, and he will assess how wildlife and livestock resource-utilization patterns influence the ecology of rangelands.  To achieve these objectives, the investigator will employ mixed methods approaches that combine ecological, social, and spatial field methods from a long-term study site within the Mara ecosystem in southern Kenya.  Although conducted in this locale, the insights developed through this project will enhance basic understanding in a much broader range of locations, including many in the United States, where individuals and groups managing domesticated grazing animals share the same habitats with wild animals.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=HYjhIzsAAAAJ,"['political ecology', 'pastoralism', 'conservation', 'Kenya']",1307,18,7,1,5,5,3,6,15,14,31,42,70,93,120,110,132,102,114,,,,143,145,109,15

For example, children with involved fathers show improvements in school readiness, physical health, peer relationships, resilience to psychopathology, and long-term economic and occupational outcomes. However, surprisingly little is known about the factors that predict whether and how fathers successfully transition to parenthood. Like mothers, fathers are affected both psychologically and physiologically by the arrival of a new child. For example, expectant and new fathers experience hormonal changes, and the structure and activity in their brains change as well. This project charts changes in individual fathers-to-be over time prior to and then after their first child is born, and explores which aspects of hormonal and brain changes are most likely to lead to positive parenting influences that optimize their babies' development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HATCH (Hormones Across the Transition to Parenthood) study seeks to understand how fathers' brains and bodies prepare to parent. Expectant opposite-sex couples (all first-time parents) will complete five assessments: in-person prenatal (mid-to-late pregnancy); perinatal (within 1-2 days of birth), and postpartum (six months after birth) visits; and additional follow-up questionnaires at 3 months and one year after birth. Cortisol, testosterone, oxytocin, and prolactin will be sampled from the father and mother at each visit. These allow tracking of individual patterns of hormonal change over time, and hormonal synchrony within couples. The investigator will also collect neural data through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning protocol that includes a high-resolution structural scan and resting state scan to assess changes in brain structure and connectivity, and several functional tasks that assess social cognition. Outcomes related to parenting, couple relationship quality, and infant health and development will be measured through videotaped, in-lab interactions as well as through self-report questionnaires.

Discrimination is a stressor that can harm mental and physical health, and opportunities for work and promotions. Previous research has found that discrimination can impair performance on cognitive tasks, which can lead to negative emotions, such as anxiety, despair, and anger. The present research examines novel approaches to regulate emotional reactions to discrimination. These approaches stem from research suggesting that reflecting on negative life events from a third-person, distanced point of view rather than from a personal, immersed point of view leads to better emotional outcomes. This complements findings with well-known models of emotion regulation, which suggest that distanced processing of emotional content lead to more positive outcomes than immersed processing. Dr. Jennifer Richeson at Yale University, examines multiple consequences of contending with experiences of group-based discrimination from a distanced versus immersed perspective. The project also tests a novel strategy to create positive emotional responses by having participants reflect on past discrimination that reveals the ways they or their group may have become stronger or benefitted from having had discrimination experiences in the past.  Creating such redemption narratives about stressful events has been found to enhance well-being and may hold promise to promote well-being in the face of discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work integrates research from affective, emotion regulation science, and social psychology to consider processes that give rise to the ill effects of discrimination. The research proposes that compared to holding an immersed perspective, holding a more distanced perspective enhances emotion regulation and emotional outcomes. Experiments examine the influence of different emotion-regulation strategies on emotional reactions, physiological arousal, and cognitive functioning, as well as the motivation to act on behalf of the group that has faced discrimination. The proposed seven experiments examine these dynamics among different societal groups that often face discrimination (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, women), and an experiment examines the role of creating a redemption narrative on reducing some of the negative mental and physical outcomes of discrimination. Consequently, the results of this project are poised to unearth novel insights to inform current understanding of the effects of discrimination on individual well-being and societal social cohesion.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=K_U7xncAAAAJ,"['Cultural Diversity', 'Prejudice', 'Intergroup Relations']",20358,69,81,131,230,270,464,569,654,621,873,913,878,1014,1044,1256,1351,1556,1670,,,,1865,2185,2093,196

For many years, researchers argued that providing individuals and communities with open access to natural resources would inevitably lead to overuse and ultimately to destruction through deforestation, overfishing, overgrazing, and other environmentally detrimental activities. However, subsequent research by political scientist and Nobel laureate Dr. Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues found that this ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario is not universal. Instead, some small communities do effectively manage local lands without external oversight. This appears to occur most often when communities have enduring, well-developed social norms for maintaining the natural environment and for sanctioning individuals who violate community standards. But these findings raise another question: If some communities can do it, why not all? Why are some communities effective at preserving their natural resources while others are not? The research supported by this award seeks to answer that question. Anthropologist Dr. Sean S. Downey (University of Maryland) will test the theory effective land management rests on more than just having the right social norms; in addition, he suggests, the social norms, the particular characteristics of the local environment, and the ecosystem services the environment provides to local users must work together to produce ecological sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few communities in the United States are both free of external oversight and also dependent primarily on the local natural environment for subsistence. Therefore, Dr. Downey and his team will travel to two forest-based villages located in a remote area in southern Belize to test the theory. The communities have a demonstrated history of local ecological knowledge and environmental stewardship but there has historically been little top-down environmental management: an ideal location for understanding how local community norms and natural ecosystem dynamics interact and create a sustainable forestry system. The researchers will collect data through multiple methods: household surveys; farmer land use interviews; and close monitoring of how the communities affect their forests. The monitoring will be accomplished through piecing together high-resolution photographs of the usage areas around each village using a GPS-linked multi-spectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. These photos will subsequently be stitched together into geo-referenced two-dimensional photo-mosaics, ground-truthed through farm plots surveys, and analyzed to understand how these environments provide for the local communities, how they are affected by human farming activity, and also how these forests recover to sustain future generations. The research team will also conduct behavioral economics experiments to assess how cooperation and punishment in the communities relate to natural resource use, and use computational analysis to determine the most important social and natural factors for effective long-term natural resource management. The project also has several integrated educational goals, including training the next generation of American scientists, educators, and policy-makers in the science of complexity; developing coursework and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Maryland; and offering a service learning project for American students in Belize. Ultimately, findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that promote effective local management of natural resources and this could lead to better and more efficient management of public lands at a significant cost savings.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3rwprgEAAAAJ,['Anthropology'],2143,19,,,,,11,10,16,45,44,59,106,131,164,145,218,209,221,,,,253,238,228,14

Despite decades of work, we have little ability to prevent, improve or treat such memory disorders. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ueli Rutishauser and colleagues are investigating how humans form, store, and retrieve memories. The research supported by this CAREER award is to observe the electrical activity of brain cells in the hippocampus, an area essential for the formation of new memories. This research is performed with human patients who are undergoing surgery to treat epilepsy. To localize seizures, these patients are implanted with small wires in different parts of their brain, which allows researchers to investigate the human nervous system at the cellular level. Using this technique, we will investigate how human brain cells change when new memories are formed. Specifically, we will test whether the formation of new memories is dependent on a brain rhythm called the ""theta oscillation"", and if disruptions of this rhythm lead to poor memory.  Critically, theta oscillations can be changed by electrical stimulation, which offers a potential technique to improve memory.  Through education, teaching, and mentoring, this CAREER award will enable new researchers and organizations to take advantage of the extremely valuable opportunities for basic research on the human nervous system presented by intracranial electrophysiology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this CAREER award is to investigate the neural mechanisms of human declarative memory at the level of individual neurons and circuits. We work with patients implanted with micro-wire electrodes who volunteer to participate in this research. The objective is to understand how the activity of networks of neurons is coordinated such that their collective action results in plasticity and long-term memories. We test the hypothesis that hippocampal theta oscillations mediate this process by combining human single-neuron recordings, behavioral testing, electrical stimulation, and computational modelling. This approach will allow us to assess the role and necessity of oscillations for the formation of human memories and thereby demonstrate the role of a specific oscillation in human cognition. We study i) how the activity of two distinct functional types of hippocampal neurons that we identified (visual and memory selective) are modulated by the theta rhythm; ii) how modulation of theta oscillations by shifts in spatial attention impacts individual neurons; and iii) whether there is a causal link between theta oscillations and memory strength. This study could provide, for the first time, a link between the cellular mechanisms of plasticity, oscillations, and human memory.

This CAREER project tests the innovative prediction that certain thoughts engage neural processes to improve our ability to regulate emotions under certain conditions. The researcher, Dr. Kateri McRae, at the University of Denver, will examine whether what a person is doing and what parts of their brain are most active, just before changing their thinking, will matter. When a task uses cognitive processes that overlap with brain regions used during emotion regulation, then the regulation that follows will be easier and more effective. The educational portion of the CAREER projects has two parts. First, undergraduate students will partner with community members to develop multimedia resources about emotions and emotion regulation that will be available via the internet. Second, outreach to the community and underrepresented students will focus on teaching them about making valid conclusions from psychological science, and learning what neuroscience measures in particular can tell us. The potential benefits of this project include discovering the conditions that allow people to manage their emotions. Benefits also include educating a large community about emotion regulation, neuroscience, and the scientific method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of this CAREER proposal is that overlapping cognitive and neural processes pave a path for emotion regulation by enhancing cognitive reappraisal. Central to this hypothesis is that rather than being passive victims of their emotions, people have tools they can use to influence their emotions. This project tests the hypothesis that three cognitive processes facilitate subsequent emotion regulation. The first process involves our brains' tendency to resolve conflict quickly and efficiently. This project examines the effects of cognitive processes involved in emotional conflict resolution. The second process is decreasing self-focus and thus emotional responses. The third process involves top-down emotion generation, such as that generated via language or rich narratives. Validated experimental manipulations are used with multiple measures of affect across six laboratory experiments. Each of the three candidate processes will be manipulated in their own study. Psychophysiological measures (e.g., electrodermal activity, heart rate, respiration) and self-reports will be used, and their effects on cognitive reappraisal examined. Three fMRI neuroimaging studies (one per process) will test the hypothesis that overlapping neural processes characterize effective precursors of cognitive reappraisal.  Lastly, a large-scale neuroimaging analysis will collapse across the three fMRI studies to identify brain regions that are common to successful cognitive reappraisal across contexts. The educational dissemination plan includes having undergraduate students work with community members to develop multimedia presentations, and discussing neuroscience research methods focusing on valid and accurate conclusions.  The implications include a better understanding of processes that lead to efficient emotion regulation, thereby enhancing personal well-being and productivity.

It is often very hard for learners to perceive and produce the sounds in the new language when they are different from the sounds in the native language. Most adult learners will never speak like a native, instead retaining a non-native accent. New evidence suggests that sleep may have a special role to play in solidifying learning of non-native sounds. Moreover, the timing of learning with respect to sleep may be a crucial factor. This project assesses the relationship between sleep and non-native speech sound learning 1) through analysis of a large database from an industry partner specializing in language learning software and 2) by imaging and analyzing the neural systems that underlie successful learning.  A greater understanding of the optimal conditions for learning that integrates knowledge from perception, sleep, and neural processing will suggest strategies for language instruction that best help learners acquire the sounds of a new language. The research program showcases an academic/industry partnership and sharing of online tools that will be developed for perceptual testing.  In addition, outreach to middle-school students will help introduce these questions and experimental methods into STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to build a model of non-native speech sound learning, the Sleep Consolidation Model for Speech (SCMS), that integrates research from literatures on sleep, perception, and neurobiology to discover facilitating and constraining conditions on speech sound acquisition. Three linked projects test the idea that consolidation during sleep serves to protect learned speech sound information from interference and also allows learners to generalize learning to new speech sound categories. Project 1 tests predictions of the SCMS using web-based training and sleep monitoring in a standard laboratory (college student) sample. Project 2 involves the analysis of a large database from users of the Rosetta Stone language learning software, enabling the research team to extend these predictions to a more diverse and ecologically valid subject sample and new target languages (e.g. Irish, Arabic). Project 3 evaluates the neural predictions of the SCMS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the relationship between brain structure and learning, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to search for the neural locus of interference effects.  The results should help maximize conditions for learning, for example, by scheduling training in relation to sleep or by minimizing interfering stimuli and tasks between training and sleep. Results may also inform neural models of speech and learning, by elucidating the role of white matter connectivity in non-native speech learning. Although questions are couched in terms of a specific perceptual problem, learning a new language, the research also has implications for perceptual learning in other domains (e.g. novel visual category acquisition).",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WV8GXcsAAAAJ,"['speech perception', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'fmri', 'aphasia', 'language']",2306,30,,,8,19,23,53,54,66,97,78,114,111,113,155,171,180,229,,,,313,241,224,24

The study will advance science through the development of new genomic methods and computational ""big data"" analyses (bioinformatics) for analyzing genomic data. These methods will initially be applied to a study of people, their cattle, and two endangered lemur species in Madagascar, which is an ideal site because humans first arrived to the island relatively recently (several thousand years ago). Research on human-environment interactions in other regions of the world, including North America where human-environment interaction started earlier, will also benefit from these methods.

Madagascar is an important island for studying the processes and consequences of human-environment interaction. The people of Madagascar have an interesting history because of their relatively recent arrival to the island, their mixed Austronesian and African ancestry, and because of their relationship to one of the world's most biologically diverse, endemic and threatened ecologies.

And yet, it is fragile: memory performance can decline noticeably with age and deteriorates even more dramatically in individuals with damage to the medial temporal lobes of the brain. Until recently, theories of memory assumed that the medial temporal lobes are dedicated solely to memory function. However, recent evidence suggests that these brain regions are important for other cognitive tasks, including imagining the future and visually discriminating between two highly similar objects. Therefore, a critical gap in current knowledge is a theory of how memory interacts with high-level visual perception and why both of these cognitive functions depend upon the medial temporal lobes. With the support of this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Rosie Cowell will develop such a theory and test it with empirical studies. By applying the theory to both amnesia caused by brain damage and the more moderate memory loss caused by normal aging, this project will investigate whether these two forms of memory loss can be explained by the same mechanisms. In addition, the project will benefit society more broadly by (1) providing a uniquely integrated research training regime in which graduate students receive direct experience with both theory-building and hypothesis-testing, and (2) broadening participation in STEM fields via hands-on science workshops for female students from high-schools that serve under-represented groups, and via public outreach in the local Massachusetts community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop a unifying theory of memory and high-level perception, the proposed research will employ behavioral studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. The studies will examine the effect of perceptual interference on memory in two cognitively-impaired populations: individuals with medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage and heathy, older adults. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the MTL houses conjunctive representations of objects and events that are critical for both memory and perception. The conjunctions are critical for perception because they allow differentiation between two similar objects or events, and critical for memory because they shield against a constant stream of perceptual interference that would otherwise cause dramatic forgetting of an object or event. It is assumed that both MTL damage and normal aging compromise the conjunctive representations, forcing a person to rely upon the fragmental, feature-based representations that remain in sensory cortex. Feature-based representations are inadequate for differentiating similar items (leading to perceptual impairments) and highly susceptible to perceptual interference (leading to memory problems). The planned studies are expected to reveal that MTL structures contribute to any cognitive task, mnemonic or perceptual, whenever the task solution requires complex, conjunctive representations of stimuli. This representational approach to understanding cognition will be fully exploited by developing a formal, neuro-computationally plausible model that links neural representations to cognitive performance with an explicit mechanism.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MIqCIbIAAAAJ,"['perirhinal', 'model', 'memory', 'perception', 'computational cognitive neuroscience']",2880,19,18,48,31,68,58,81,123,105,207,152,151,205,182,159,179,315,185,,9,10,149,181,220,17

Importantly, these motor skills are often used in new situations, where attention may be distracted by other events or objects. For example, during an emergency the pilot must continue to operate the aircraft while maintaining communications with ground authorities and other crew members and assessing the state of the aircraft. Similarly, a stroke patient recovering the ability to walk must attend to cars, other pedestrians, and obstacles in the path in order to avoid collisions. Attentional demands may also differ when a motor skill is first learned and when it is performed at a later time. What if skills learned when there is no distraction deteriorate when distractions are present at recall, or vice versa?

The investigators will measure chewing patterns in 23 primate species that are given foods spanning a range of material properties, to see how individuals in each species process the different foods and how this processing relates to the shape of their jaw and skull. These comparative data will be important not only for framing ecological research in living primate species, but for reconstructing diet and feeding behaviors in extinct primate and hominin species based on fossil jaws and skulls. The project will foster interdisciplinary approaches to training and education involving members of under-represented groups, and will support training and mentorship of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students and undergraduates as well as local STEM teachers and students, all of whom will participate in lab apprenticeship, scientific presentations and public outreach to local institutions and the lay public.  Therefore, another benefit to society includes development of a novel training environment for the next generation of academic researchers and educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phenotypic variation in the primate skull is influenced by masticatory stress, with taxa relying on stiff or tough foods having specialized jaws, teeth and jaw muscles.  However, the link between diet and jaw form in living and fossil primates is poorly understood.  Difficulty understanding adaptive diversity in the feeding apparatus is due to two shortcomings of the evidence about diet-related chewing and loading behaviors. The first is the fact that infrequent, high-magnitude forces elicit the same physiological and evolutionary responses in bone as do low-magnitude, cyclical loads.  In the skull, a second and related issue is a surprisingly incomplete knowledge of the role of food properties on variation in chewing behaviors that underlie load-related variation in primate jaw form.  Given the ubiquity with which cyclical loading is invoked to explain jaw robusticity in fossil hominins, the remarkable lack of key behavioral data on this chewing pattern cannot be overstated.  Using in vivo data on 23 representative primate species kept in domestic institutions, this project tests the hypothesis that food material properties affect masticatory parameters underlying variation in cyclical loading of primate jaws: chewing frequency, chewing investment, and chewing duration.  High-speed video will record dynamic diet-related chewing patterns in isolated and unrestrained adult primates presented a known mass of five foods that span a range of material properties paralleling the diversity of values for items ingested by wild primates.  Intra- and interspecific analyses will compare chewing parameters with food stiffness, toughness, and respective oral fragmentation indices.

Such learning is particularly consequential during adolescence, when increased exploration and autonomy confer many opportunities to make new choices. Poor decision-making represents one of the greatest perils of adolescence, with mortality rates doubling during this developmental stage, in large part due to risky or impulsive actions. However, the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning this developmental period of increased risky decision-making are not well understood. The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize how the dynamic developmental trajectory of brain circuitry involved in learning through positive and negative experience shapes real-world choices. Drawing upon behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging approaches, this work will examine how neurocognitive changes in value-based learning may give rise to a window of increased risky and impulsive decision-making during adolescence. A refined understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental changes in real-world decision-making has broad relevance across a number of societal domains including public policy, adolescent health, and juvenile justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will test whether risky and impulsive choice may stem in part from developmental changes in two specific aspects of how individuals learn from experience: (i) the relative weighting individuals place upon positive versus negative outcomes of past actions and (ii) the degree to which individuals form and recruit mental models of the potential future consequences of their actions. A developmental sample of participants, spanning late childhood to young adulthood, will complete sequential decision-making tasks in which they make a series of choices that can yield good or bad outcomes. By applying computational reinforcement-learning models to participants' choices in these tasks, we can precisely quantify developmental changes in these component processes of learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to characterize corresponding developmental changes in the brain circuitry engaged during learning. We will assess whether these neurocognitive changes in learning are predictive of participants' reports of their real-world risky and impulsive behavior, and whether they have distinct explanatory power from that of behavioral economic tasks that are commonly used to index risky and impulsive choice tendencies, but do not involve learning. A longitudinal follow-up session will enable assessment of the covariance between changes in learning and real-world risky and impulsive behavior as participants advance in their transition through adolescence.

This research project aims to resolve an apparent contradiction in human color perception. When a human observer is asked to detect a colored target that is barely visible, the visual system sums color signals across space to achieve maximum sensitivity to the weak stimulus. However, when one views a highly-colored scene, the visual system takes the difference between color signals at different locations, leading to color appearance that is highly dependent on contrasts in color. The apparent contradiction between adding and subtracting can be resolved by the hypothesis that color perception adds color signals at threshold, when they are barely visible, but subtracts color signals when color stimuli are well above threshold. This research tests this hypothesis by studying how color perception depends on the pattern of the color in space. Spacing has different effects on color perception if the visual system is adding or subtracting color signals. Better understanding of how the visual system processes color may translate to advances in fields such as lighting design or color graphics. The project involves training of young scientists in methods of studying human vision through measuring behavior and brain activity, as well as science outreach to public school students.<br/><br/>The experiments will measure the spatial pattern dependence of suprathreshold color perception in humans and compare suprathreshold results with those at color threshold. Two different techniques for studying suprathreshold color perception are used: hue and saturation scaling, and reaction times. The project also includes measurements of the human cVEP (color-Visual Evoked Potential, an EEG measure of color responses in early visual cortex) and its dependence on spatial stimulus variables at different levels of color contrast. The aim of the cVEP experiments is to determine the cortical mechanisms that are the basis of color perception near threshold and suprathreshold.

The evolution of exchange networks underscores the need to know how people construct their identity through consumption. Therefore, there is an increasing interest within archaeology to explore the presence of pre-capitalist market exchange in ancient states, and to question how these institutions structured material value, consumer communities, cities, and states. Situated within this broader context, the project will investigate the processes of how regional trade, state exchange, and household identity changed with the advent of marketplaces within a pre-Columbian urban cityscape in Belize, Central America. Through analyses of obsidian (volcanic glass) artifacts - a durable and economically vital stone material - this research will (1) reconstruct and trace their movement from distant raw material sources into the exchange network of a major urban center; (2) determine how obsidian was distributed to the population through regulated or unregulated political controls; and (3) explore how the crafting and exchange of obsidian helped to construct and concretize a shared local identity that endured for centuries. As crafted materials circulate, they expose political/economic/social mechanisms that provision consumers (e.g., market and/or gift exchange). Archaeology has a unique historicized perspective to study the cultural and socioeconomic value of certain objects and materials within different cultural groups as they were exchanged over vast distances. The data generated will enable the emergence of a comprehensive picture in which a study of materials exposes different societal dynamics. The research also encourages an increased collaboration whereby archaeologists as material analysts can expand technical student training through the open sharing of research methods and data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the guidance of Dr. Steven Brandt (University of Florida), Dr. Diane Chase, and Dr. Arlen Chase (University of Central Florida), Lucas Martindale Johnson will investigate ancient Maya regional obsidian exchange, craft production, ritual and daily events, and the communities that carried out such actions at the ancient Maya site of Caracol, Belize. Research at this ancient Maya city-state provides an ideal setting to demonstrate how a study of obsidian explores regional connections to distant obsidian-rich locations in the highlands of modern day Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras and the economic mechanisms by which the general population were provisioned. By sourcing obsidian to chemically unique geological locations, the project will discover the distance and the different social and physical pathways materials traveled before arriving at a craft production site. By conducting a sourcing analysis in which elemental composition is ascertained through the use of a portable X-ray fluorescence machine, this project will determine trade routes and regional connections. At a later date within the city of Caracol, local household consumers obtained obsidian crafts to for use as casual tools and/or ritualized materials. Caracol's crafting and internal exchange mechanisms will be studied by mapping artifact distributions at more than 200 ancient Maya households spread over nearly 170 square kilometers (65 square miles). Through mapping artifact distributions, this research will explore how crafting and craft exchange may or may not have been controlled by the politically and economically powerful, as well as investigate how identities are produced through the production and use of obsidian artifacts.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=z1DYOIIAAAAJ,['high performance computing'],2574,22,107,94,85,106,84,90,70,71,69,65,53,79,93,78,102,99,114,91,93,92,141,142,163,17

Can action similarly inform our visual experience of the world?  The goal of this research is to determine whether the ability to reach out and grasp an object enhances visual information that helps people interact more effectively with their immediate surroundings. The research will also assess whether training to grasp objects in novel ways can influence people's visual experience. An enhanced understanding of how the action of grasping might alter visual perception can inform the design of applications for handheld mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and can help tailor interfaces to enhance user experience and safety. In addition, the project provides opportunities for high school students and Native American college students to become involved in STEM research (through the North Dakota Governor's School program and the NSF-funded NATURE program).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does the capacity for action shape visual cognition? Observers process objects that are within peripersonal space  (objects they can easily grasp with their hands) differently than objects outside of their reach. A series of psychophysical experiments evaluates the hypothesis that changes in visual processing of graspable objects near the hands reflect an adaptation of the visual system to behavioral contexts. Dr. Thomas will examine how grasp posture creates affordances for action that bias processing of action-relevant visual information. Visual biases associated with power grip and precision grip postures will also be evaluated in situations with differing visual processing task demands. Potential plasticity of alterations in visual processing near the hands will be evaluated by determining whether action-specific training alters how observers process action-relevant visual information. These experiments explore the potential influence of both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms that may contribute to altered vision near the hands and determine the relationships between visual biases associated with the planning of dynamic actions and those associated with static hand postures.

It likely played a key role as languages evolved and it continues to play important roles in children's language acquisition and adult communication.  Group communication is typical of a variety of high-stakes settings, including classroom education and business teams, yet surprisingly little is known about what makes communication in groups successful. One determinant of success is the ability to appreciate the perspective of the other person or people in the conversation. Basic communicative exchanges such as asking a question require calculations about what other people know. For example, if you want to know the answer to a question such as ""Where is the gas meter?"" it is first necessary to determine who is likely to know the answer in order to ask the appropriate person (e.g., a plumber is likely to know, but a young child is not). Keeping track of who knows what also allows us to navigate social relationships effectively. For example, if you once tell your friend ""My son is getting married in June,"" it is usually communicating good news.  If you repeat the same information to the same friend several times, it may instead signal anxiety, uncertainty, or disbelief. This project examines how people take into account the knowledge and perspective of other people in communicative settings and examines conversations among groups of three or more individuals, each of whom brings a different set of beliefs and knowledge to the conversation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students will have opportunities to participate in laboratory research and high school students and elderly individuals from the community will be involved in laboratory activities through community outreach programs. The results of studies on conversation will not only advance understanding of psychological and linguistic processes but can also be used to advance computer dialog systems (such as Siri). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work uses methods established by the principal investigator to examine key open questions regarding language use in communicative settings. The idea is that conversational partners serve as contextual memory cues, supporting the partner-specificity of language use. This people-as-contexts (PAC) idea is used as a framework (1) to evaluate candidate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms supporting perspective-taking in multiparty conversation; (2) to test predictions concerning the binding of partners to language and generalization to new contexts; and (3) to examine how adaptation scales up to multiparty conversation.

For example, speakers tend to say the word nine more quickly in the sentence A stitch in time saves nine than in the sentence The number I am thinking of is nine.  Some of these differences in timing are driven by our desire to help the listener understand us: the word nine is less predictable in the second sentence than it is in the first, so we lengthen it to give our listeners extra time to understand it.  Alternatively, speakers may shorten nine in the first sentence because it is easier to say. Slowing down and speeding up during speaking may give the production system the time it needs to plan and produce accurate, continuous speech.  This project examines the types of planning that occur during speech and the different ways they may affect our speaking rate. The results of this project may eventually lead to better interventions for individuals with speech disorders and to advances in designing artificial speech systems that sound more natural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A puzzle for language researchers is understanding the factors that affect how speakers actualize specific words.  For example, the length of a given word is driven, at least in part, by how informative the word is in the discourse (e.g., how predictable it is, how much new information it provides, etc?). What is less well understood are the specific factors and mechanisms that underlie the timing and duration of each word. This project tests the hypothesis that different levels of linguistic planning have differential effects on time to articulation and word duration, a theory the investigator calls the ?two-domain hypothesis.? Under this hypothesis, lexical and conceptual planning influence the time to begin articulating a word, while planning processes related to phonological ordering affect the timing of producing the word itself.   Preliminary work suggests that when the process of encoding the order of a word?s sounds is complex, the word is lengthened.  On the other hand, when this phonological encoding proceeds smoothly, the word is shorter.  Preliminary experiments also suggest that lexical priming affects the time to begin a word?s articulation, but not the word?s duration. The proposed experiments use an event-description paradigm to test the predictions of the two-domain hypothesis and will lead to a better understanding of which aspects of planning influence word duration.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vjUTK-wAAAAJ,"['psycholinguistics', 'prosody', 'language', 'reading']",3852,31,15,31,39,51,51,61,105,136,130,145,208,259,279,288,289,307,308,,,,310,317,397,31

The doctoral student will seek to determine whether ice margins behaved synchronously in the region and whether they reached their maximum extent before or during the time known as the Little Ice Age from about 1300 to 1900.  A more precise determination of when the southern Greenland ice sheet reached its maximum extent will provide new information and insights regarding broader hemispheric climate dynamics.  If the southern Greenland ice margins reached their maximum extent during the Little Ice Age at the same time as glacial margins in Europe and North America, then the southern Greenland ice sheet likely behaved in concert with a hemispheric wide climate signal.  This finding would suggest that current southern Greenland ice sheet retreat might be in response to warming trends around the globe in recent centuries that are influencing ice retreat in Europe and North America.  If the southern Greenland ice sheet reached its maximum before the Little Ice Age, however, a more complex set of explanations for why ice margins in different parts of the Northern Hemisphere reached their maxima during different time periods will be required.  Identification of an earlier maximum also would require reconsideration of dynamics affecting the southern Greenland ice sheet itself, because its margins may stabilize in the future as climate models predict minimal warming over this part of Greenland in the coming century.  Project findings will be shared more broadly with school groups and the public through education and museum programs.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will date the retreat of two southern Greenland ice sheet outlet glaciers using cosmogenic surface exposure ages on boulders from moraines that are dated as being more than 300 years in age. `These results will be compared with existing data from a pilot study and new data to the north of these locations. In the end, four different ice margins in southern Greenland will be dated, thereby allowing the testing of spatial and temporal variability in the southern Greenland ice sheet.  The student will address two fundamental research questions.  (1) When was the late-Holocene maximum of the southern Greenland ice sheet?  Regarding this question, the student will test the hypothesis that the late-Holocene maximum underwent a late-Holocene advance more extensive than its Little Ice Age advance in response to significant early cooling.  (2) Does regional climate govern southern Greenland ice sheet variability at centennial timescales?  The student will address this question by testing the hypothesis that the southern Greenland ice sheet responds synchronously to centennial climate variations, such as those observed during the late Holocene. Testing these hypotheses will shed light on geologically recent ice sheet-climate interactions important for modeling the Greenland ice sheet response to spatially variable temperature changes.  Project results will determine if southern GIS margins have responded to climatic changes of less than several degrees on a timescale relevant to humanity?s near-term future, a potentially transformative result, particularly for predicting sea-level rise over the coming century.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=HfORiXMAAAAJ,['glacier and ice-sheet change'],11956,45,,,,,37,73,181,277,429,485,625,721,862,858,1041,1115,1154,,,,1319,1284,1234,130

Instead they see the world as culturally, economically and politically interconnected with massive movement of people, goods and information. In this highly fluid context people create and recreate ethnic, cultural and racial identities.  The study of these processes is key to understanding social change and cultural conflict.  Archaeology is particularly well positioned to study connectivity, movement, and ethnogenesis over the long span of human history.  Dr. McGuire of Binghamton University, along with Mexican colleagues will study these processes among prehistoric peoples in northwest M閼煎巵ico and the southwestern United States. The project focuses on the Trincheras Tradition of northern Sonora, Mexico to examine connectivity, movement and ethnogenesis linking central Mexico with the southwestern United States. The project transcends the U.S. - Mexico border to establish contemporary research connectivity and to foster international cooperation. It integrates research with education to promote teaching, training and learning. It is a bi-national project that employs US and Mexican students in a cooperative research program. It introduces these students to existing networks that link North American and Mexican archaeologists in northern M閼煎巵ico. The public education component of the research includes lectures in the US and M閼煎巵ico and field trips for interested public groups from both nations. The researchers publish their results both in M閼煎巵ico and the United States using scientific outlets, popular journals, and museum exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. McGuire and his colleagues examine how pre- AD 1200 Trincheras Tradition people participated in a series of cultural traditions that connected the prehistoric Hohokam peoples of southern Arizona with the prehistoric cultures of West M閼煎巵ico. The project?s transnational, collaborative research evaluates three alternatives for processes of movement, connectivity, and ethnogenesis in the Trincheras Tradition. The Trincheras as Hohokam model proposes that the Trincheras Tradition was the southernmost extension of the Hohokam. The Mexican Migration model envisions a common culture across northern Sonora and southern Arizona that Hohokam migrants displace in southern Arizona. The West Mexico model argues that before the AD 1200s the Trincheras Tradition was part of a series of cultural traditions that connected the peoples of southern Arizona with the prehistoric cultures of West Mexico. The project gathers the data to test these models by doing the first intensive excavations in Trincheras Tradition sites dating before the AD 1200s. Evaluating these three alternatives helps archaeologists to better understand processes that spanned the U.S. and Mexico. In doing so, the research contributes to our understanding of social change and cultural conflict at a continental scale.

The doctoral student will explore how the law could potentially recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is incorporated into multiple legal spaces and systems.  The project will broaden theoretical understandings of linkages among human systems, climate and environmental change, and spatial dimensions of the ocean and law in the greater Arctic region.  The project will advance conceptualizations of sea ice in a way that recognizes that sea ice is not a stationary object, because it moves through time and space in response to the physical forces of wind, ocean currents, and heating.  Furthermore, sea ice is neither terrestrial nor marine, just as it is neither purely solid nor liquid.  Project findings will expand knowledge about the relationships between this dynamic physical element and the political powers that govern a complex ocean environment.  The project will provide new insights regarding how the law can recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is attached to and integrated into multiple legal spaces and systems.  These insights will be of value to those charged with overseeing activities in regions where sea ice occurs.

In conducting this project, the doctoral student will combine perspectives from the fields of legal geography and ocean-space studies to assess how dynamic and changing sea ice shapes the marine social-environment, particularly in terms of legal and political contestations in ocean-spaces of the greater Arctic region.  The student will use three data-collection strategies:  legal archival analysis to gain a base understanding of all relevant laws and agreements; document analysis of reports and other official documents to understand and contextualize the broader environmental, social, political and economic issues in each of these regions; and semi-structured interviews with policy experts, operational experts that work in sea-ice areas, and sea-ice researchers.

Particular language practices underpin some types of social relationships while also hindering others. As social relationships change, languages change in form and function, enabling new forms of sociality. The research supported by this award asks: What new ways of using indigenous and global languages are emerging today? And how are these new verbal practices enabling or preventing social change? Supervised by Dr. Miki Makihara of City University of New York, anthropology doctoral student Mariapaola Gritti will investigate these questions through a 15-month linguistic-ethnographic study of children's language practices in a village in American Samoan, a U.S. territory. This project will advance understanding of social change, expand existing linguistic methodologies, and clarify how language practices can underpin the sustainability of communities. It will also inform language policy. By documenting children's communicative practices, this project will enable mid- and long-term monitoring of one such policy: the Samoan-language instruction program currently piloted by the American Samoa Department of Education and aimed both to improve educational achievement and foster local language and culture maintenance in this U.S. territory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Samoa is an particularly appropriate site for this research because residents there face changes on multiple fronts, including, their environment, culture, forms of social organization, and possibilities for political participation.  In addition, transnational kinship and economic relations, migration to Hawaii and the U.S. mainland, official use of English, attempts to introduce Samoan-language instruction in schools, and campaigns promoting Western pedagogical models all affect American Samoan ways of speaking Samoan and English. The intensity and simultaneity of these developments make the linguistic effects more salient for identification, documentation, and analysis, particularly in young children's speech. Therefore, Gritti will audio and video record and observe daily children's spontaneous social and linguistic interactions. She will survey these children's families and conduct ethnographic observation and interviews in the community. Her analysis of the language corpus will focus on two aspects of children's speech: (1) English borrowings into Samoan, which children use with variable frequency and phonology; and (2) personal pronouns, which children may use with a mixture of English or Samoan syntax and semantics. Employing the innovative concept of ""semiotic potential,"" Gritti will monitor changes in frequency and effects of variants across situations, among children, and over developmental stages, to highlight how children's emerging grammar systems reflect their communicative needs, while also contributing to change in the language they speak. Finally, children's mimetic or play activities will be analyzed to identify children's ideas about the different variants, about Samoan and English, and about the changing world around them.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BT9aL6IAAAAJ,"['linguistic anthropology', 'sociolinguistics', 'discourse analysis', 'linguistic ethnography']",681,12,4,9,4,11,12,28,31,29,27,35,52,43,67,46,34,50,33,4,2,2,41,49,33,8

Although conducted in a contemporary context, the project will help answer important questions in paleoecological research by helping quantify the relationships between pollen (as a vegetation proxy) and key drivers like fire, herbivory, and topography.  The project will enhance the value of a long-term dataset that is the longest-running annual record of North American grassland pollen composition.  The doctoral student will work with a high school serving underrepresented populations to integrate a research-based module into their science curriculum.

The doctoral student will conduct this project in a tallgrass prairie in Kansas.  The study area is diverse, with variable topography, and includes sites that have experienced a range of different burning and grazing treatments.  The research will focus on quantifying the relationships between grassland pollen assemblages and the biotic and abiotic variables influencing the region.  This will be accomplished by identifying pollen from multiple traps throughout the study to produce a multi-year set of modern pollen data.  The doctoral student will quantify these data in order to assess interannual variations in grassland pollen through multivariate statistical analyses.

In addition to archaeologically investigating the risks plaguing these communities, the researchers will also compare the strategies each enslaved community employed to mitigate both social and natural hazards in their environment. This comparative study uses a mixed methods approach, combining the use of slave narratives and primary accounts with archaeological evidence recovered from the former residential spaces of enslaved peoples living in environmentally distinct regions. This research goes beyond current African Diaspora scholarship to highlight the experiences of enslaved peoples serving the most elite factions of society, as well as uncovering those specific environmental challenges of primary concern to enslaved peoples living within urban insular and rural landlocked regions across the Diaspora, and compares the range of cultural adaptations different enslaved communities used to overcome the challenges they faced. The current project remains relevant for risk prone communities across the globe, as certain marginalized or indigenous cultures continue to be threatened by external forces beyond their control. Investigating the use of different strategies to diminish the effects of external forces in the past will present new directives in how to better protect marginalized peoples in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alicia Odewale and her team will conduct new archaeological investigations around the Danish West India and Guinea Company Warehouse inside the Christiansted National Historic Site in St. Croix, and compare these newly recovered artifacts to the extensive material already being processed by the Archaeology Department at the Montpelier Plantation Estate in Virginia. The investigators will identify and rank the primary risks of most concern to the enslaved community in each region from first-hand accounts of enslaved peoples in the West Indies and Virginia. Four types of risk sensitive artifact classes including: faunal remains, metal wares, ceramics and trade goods found at each site will then be used to identify the possible cultural responses to those challenges that presented the greatest threats to the enslaved community in each region. The central question of this study asks which of these sites presents a riskier environment for enslaved peoples during the late plantation era. The investigators hypothesize that the social and natural hazards present in the urban Caribbean environment for the royal enslaved laborers in St. Croix will pose a greater threat to the enslaved community than the rural antebellum plantation environment belonging to the presidential enslaved laborers in Virginia.

In the visual system such neuroplasticity occurs routinely, for example when we move from indoors to outside. Changing environments affects visual input dramatically, and cortical neurons alter how they respond in order to keep us seeing well. This type of neuroplasticity, called visual adaptation, occurs readily in the adult brain. Its effects tend to be short-lasting, however, limiting its potential applications in education, training, and health. To understand and overcome this roadblock, Dr. Stephen Engel and colleagues at The University of Minnesota will test the limits of adaptation, by extending laboratory studies an order of magnitude in duration. Participants will adapt for up to a week continuously, by viewing the world through virtual reality goggles that display modified output of a head-mounted camera. The experiments will measure how long-lasting the effects of adaptation can become, and test several factors that could be limiting the growth of this type of neuroplasticity. These include competition between the parts of the brain that benefit from neuroplasticity and the parts that could be hurt by it, since they depend upon stability of the brain regions that provide their input. Understanding adaptation should allow it to produce beneficial neuroplasticity, which has many applications. It could become part of training visual experts such as baggage scanner operators or imagery analysts. It could become part of efforts to rewire the brains of patients suffering from visual diseases, such as amblyopia (""lazy eye""). The work will also test theories of neuroplasticity that are applicable in many domains. It will produce educational materials for teaching of cognitive neuroscience, and will directly support the training of a diverse set of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adult visual cortex can alter its function dramatically in response to changes in the environment, allowing it to function optimally, despite large changes in input. Critically, the longer vision experiences an environment, the stronger and longer lasting adaptation becomes. This suggests that long-term exposure to altered visual input may produce long-lasting changes in cortex. Technical issues have prevented the study of long adapting durations under controlled conditions, however leaving it unknown whether some factors 'put on the brakes', restricting its strength and durability. The PI developed methods to overcome this roadblock, and examined effects of a 4-days of continuous adaptation, revealing significant limits. The general goal of the grant is to understand the brakes producing those limits. For vision as a whole, adaptation can produce costs, as well as benefits, and this proposal will test whether observed limits are due to them. A first set of experiments will test whether costs limit adaptation in early visual areas, examining specific costs from the literature, removing them, and observing whether limits on adaptation remain present. A second set of experiments will examine longer-term adaptation. They will test the hypothesis that long-term adaptation can overcome limits, reducing costs by correcting for a ""coding catastrophe"" in later visual areas. The work will distinguish between major theories of adaptation, using quantitative analysis of behavioral and functional MRI (fMRI) data. It also represents a major empirical step forward; dozens of studies have examined adaptation in visual cortex, but no previous work has measured or tested adaptation's limits. Results of this research could influence work in a diverse array of fields where visual plasticity is important, from education to the military to public health. Results of the work will be incorporated into educational materials (an introductory fMRI course and text) that will be freely distributed.

The project places alternate framings of pesticides - as indispensable to agricultural production or as unacceptable environmental pollutants - within the context of the racial legacy of plantation agriculture.  By centering race as a factor agricultural and environmental politics, this project seeks to advance understanding of the relationship between rural inequality and environmental change. It asks how the racial politics of the plantation impacted early development of pesticides as an agricultural technology; how historic tensions between agricultural productivity and racial equity contributed to current structures of agro-environmental regulation; and how different narratives of agricultural change connected to race relations inform contemporary debates over the use and regulation of pesticides. Placing the dual objectives of racial equity and agricultural productivity at the center of inquiry, the project provides a policy-relevant analysis of the obstacles to and opportunities for greater environmental and social sustainability through agricultural practices.

Through semi-structured interviews and participant observation, the study also examines how this history informs contemporary uses and understandings of pesticides in the present day.

Taken together, state migration policies, refugee laws, and international agreements constitute what is here termed the ""refugee regime"" - a set of institutional practices through which the migration policies of countries in the West and the Middle East have become increasingly interconnected. This research draws attention to (1) the transnational activities of state agencies, humanitarian organizations, and non-state actors in managing forced migration, and (2) forced migrants' experiences along their journeys.

Despite its central importance, researchers lack a simple way to measure a person's attentional functioning.  Although no mental process can be reduced to a single number, both research and practical settings can benefit from starting with standardized and quantifiable measures.  For example, intelligence research and education practice depends heavily on g, an index of fluid intelligence. A comparable measure is lacking for attention.  The goal of this project is to develop an attention profile measure that can 1) quantify a person's attentional function, 2) predict behavior, 3) and to facilitate comparison of attentional performance across individuals, tasks, and sites, and, importantly, over time.  A quantifiable and standardized whole-brain attention measure can have transformative utility for research and practical applications.

Functional connectivity, or correlations in patterns of brain activation (measured via fMRI), is thought to reflect this inter-regional communication. But communication between brain regions ultimately depends on structural connectivity: the white matter tracts that, either directly or indirectly, connect them. This proposal is aimed at resolving two open questions: 1) What are the dynamic relationships between structural and functional connectivity, for the key networks known to be involved in reasoning and other higher cognitive processes, as these develop together across childhood?, and 2) How do these dynamic relationships affect developmental improvements in reasoning ability? The answers that we obtain will provide both fundamental insight into the development of brain connectivity and mechanistic insight into the development of reasoning ability. This knowledge could impact future research both on educational and training programs designed to teach reasoning ability, and on interventions or medical programs designed to correct problems in reasoning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these questions, we will combine fMRI, DTI, and behavioral data from three longitudinal developmental datasets, collected at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and Vanderbilt University. By combining datasets, we are able to examine longitudinal data from 400 children and young adults between the ages of 6 and 22. Our primary measures of interest include a) intrinsic functional connectivity between specific regions of interest; b) structural connectivity, measured via fractional anisotropy along tracts that connect these regions; and c) reasoning ability, measured via standard cognitive tests. Our main analyses will focus on connectivity within and between two brain networks, the fronto-parietal network and cingulo-opercular network, which are most closely associated with reasoning and other higher cognitive functions. Mixed-model regression analyses will be employed to examine concurrent relationships among structural and functional connectivity in these networks and reasoning ability.

These reinforcement-learning mechanisms have well-known neural correlates, and theories of such learning provide excellent accounts for human behavior in limited contexts. However, trial-and-error learning has typically been studied in laboratory tasks in which value-associated features are known and are the only stimulus aspects presented to subjects. Thus, theories of how this type of learning is accomplished in the real world face a key problem: there are a multitude of potentially relevant aspects of experience that co-occur with any given decision or outcome, so which associations should be learned and guide future behavior? This project explores how humans cope with a multidimensional world when making experience-guided decisions. A better understanding of human decision-making behavior will facilitate more complete theories of learning, enable us to better predict and enhance real-world decision-making, and improve understanding of how such decision-making might break down due to mental disorders. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and include broad public outreach in the form of online demonstrations and explanations of models of learning and decision-making. Further, the proposed activity includes a yearly workshop on MRI methods, which will provide training opportunities in new methods and outreach to students and faculty across fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will use computational modeling of behavior and model-based fMRI to assess how humans learn about relevant and irrelevant features of the world during reward-guided decision-making. The first study will address whether irrelevant stimulus dimensions are tracked with respect to value, both in terms of choice behavior and in terms of neural representations of value. Specifically, the project will ask whether reward prediction error signals in ventral striatum and elsewhere in the brain are explained solely by relevant feature-value associations, or whether irrelevant feature-value associations are also tracked neurally and influence behavior. The second study will examine whether learned statistical contingencies in one domain, visual perception, arbitrarily influence value learning both in terms of behavior and brain activity. Findings from this study will illuminate how distinct associative learning mechanisms interact to guide behavior. Finally, a third study will examine the role of context in reward-guided decision-making, examining how well contextual features can be incorporated into decision-making. The results of this work will guide development of human reinforcement learning theories towards accommodating the complexity of real-world decision-making environments.

It examines how environmental conditions interact with socio-political factors and development policy to influence the production of the world's most valuable seafood commodity. Shrimp diseases result in dramatic economic losses in regions reliant on aquaculture and create high market volatility in regions that primarily fish for wild shrimp, such as the United States. A better understanding of the socio-political and environmental conditions that drive the problem of disease will strengthen the food production economies of both types of regions, particularly for small-scale producers who are disproportionately affected by disease outbreaks. The project incorporates environmental and contextual factors into commodities research, which has traditionally focused on the role of firms in explaining how commodities like shrimp are produced. The focus on shrimp disease is expected to help improve disease remediation management for shrimp farmers as well as assist the identification and dissemination of effective responses to market volatility for U.S. producers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrimp are produced in two distinct ways: (a) aquaculture (farming) in land-based ponds and (b) traditional wild-capture methods. Most consumers in the global marketplace do not differentiate shrimp produced by these two methods. As a result, the growth of aquaculture has dramatically increased supply and caused a fall in global prices for producers using both methods. This growth has been accompanied by the emergence of diseases in shrimp farms, which have caused significant economic loss and dramatic price volatility in the global market. Despite decades of research, treatment of most major diseases remains difficult or impossible. The problem is especially severe for many small-scale producers in both the U.S. and Asia, who are impacted by the general fall in prices and lack the knowledge or resources to effectively respond to disease losses or market volatility. This project addresses these issues by asking what structural and socioeconomic drivers lead to the emergence of disease in certain areas, how disease impacts producers at local levels, and how small-scale producers adapt and respond to disease. The research methods combine analysis of contextual historical and economic data with interviews with shrimp producers and local traders in field sites in North Carolina and Aceh, Indonesia. This approach addresses the ""black box"" problem of commodities research, in which the consumer side of commodity exchanges are well understood, but the social and environmental conditions of production at the local level are not.

The project will focus on the complex interplay among farming philosophies, access to resources, and participation in local and regional food systems.  It also will examine how these factors influence farmer decision making and soil fertility on participating farms.  This project will provide new information regarding the human-environment aspects of agricultural sustainability and insight into the potential for local and regional food system activities like farmers markets to address the challenges of reducing adverse environmental impacts of food production and improving agricultural sustainability. The special attention given to phosphorus will yield new findings regarding the ability of local and regional food systems to break from dependence on non-renewable sources of fertilizer and prevent excessive application of nutrients that can damage connected ecosystems. Findings will be delivered directly to farmers and other engaged in local and regional food systems to help improve their practices as well as to sustainable farming associations and non-profits that work to connect farmers with resources needed to strengthen local and regional food systems.

(2) How does participation in a local and regional food systems influence soil fertility management decisions?  (3) How resilient is the soil fertility of local and regional food systems?  The student will integrate information from interviews with the results of soil testing for statistical analysis to better understand how social and ecological factors interact and contribute to sustainable soil fertility.  Interview analysis will identify key challenges and successes in sustainable soil management and provide greater context for statistical analysis.

As a result, these communities have increasingly tended to become laboratories for developing methods of governance to best manage, measure, and account for potentially hazardous atmospheric phenomena. Many of these communities, however, have long had to cope with and develop effective decision-making regimes in response to such seasonal weather effects. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, explores the interaction between the practices and knowledge that has been circulated among coastal residents and meteorologists, and the more recent apparatus of ecological governance that has been instituted in such contexts of climatic vulnerability.

The research takes place in Bangladesh, a low-lying deltaic country that faces seasonal storms, monsoon rains, cyclones, and flooding on a yearly basis. Now heralded as the epicenter of climate change, Bangladesh has become a laboratory for global development initiatives trying to pioneer climate relief efforts. As climate change becomes the primary justification for organizational and state intervention into people's lives and livelihoods along the southwest coast, top-down ways of articulating risk in the idiom of climate tend to obscure the experiences of those who have been living with environmental uncertainty in unstable landscapes for generations. This research strives to analyze what the everyday experience of living with potentially catastrophic weather entails. By asking how a new regime of ecological risk takes discursive, programmatic, and material form in Bangladesh, this study explores how knowledge about weather is produced at various scales, as well as how weather is framed a problem of governance and management.

The establishment and maintenance of a stable middle class has long been regarded as essential to the health of the economy, and the viable pursuit of upward mobility is a key measure of confidence for that system. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how educated youth are able to maintain aspirations for upward mobility in the face of significant structural challenges. The findings will be useful to policymakers, planners, and practitioners interested in sustainable economic development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert Miles Loomis, under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Cole at the University of Chicago, examines how members of a growing underclass of educated but irregularly employed rural graduates living on the margins of major metropolises negotiate the tension between aspirations for upward mobility and present realities of poverty and precarious employment. The research specifically such one such group in China (yi zu; or ""ant tribe""), an ideal site for exploring this question as it has seen a rapidly developing middle class since initiating its policies for ""reform and opening"" (gaige kaifang) in the late-1970s. Much of the population now sees education as only way out of poverty. Rural parents, especially, often spend all of their savings to ensure that their children attend college and land jobs in urban areas. The turn to education as a means of social mobility was itself encouraged by the government's decision in 1999 to radically expand the university system, making higher education more accessible through marketization. Yet despite the greater availability of tuition-based degrees, the Chinese economy has not generated enough white-collar jobs to absorb this massive influx of graduates. Yet members of this group, as educated youth, remain hopeful about their ability to enter into China's ""high quality"" workforce. By providing an in depth ethnographic look at this growing population, this project will explore how marginalized rural youth make sense of and act upon the terms of their social participation in contemporary urban China, and the ways they may be reproducing or challenging the nature of value and social hierarchy as they do so.

Accordingly, it has called for a new ""Community-Based Approach"" to humanitarian aid, which integrates refugees in their neighboring countries through welfare programs and infrastructural support. The Syrian refugee crisis, however, throws this new approach in grave doubt. The sheer scale of civilian displacement, now reaching 4.3 million people, makes integration immeasurably difficult for countries neighboring Syria. With the mass exodus of refugees, it is now vital to understand how the refugee crisis is being managed in asylum countries. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores how humanitarian organizations negotiate the challenges of community-based aid programs in response to refugee crises. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malay Firoz, under the supervision of Dr. Catherine Lutz of Brown University, will examine how humanitarian organizations implement community-based aid programs in Jordan and Lebanon. As small developing countries, both Jordan and Lebanon are struggling to cope with the sudden influx of refugees, and their governments are anxious to prevent refugees from integrating. However, while the relatively stable Jordanian government has strictly regulated its borders and contained refugees in camps, domestic turmoil has prevented the Lebanese government from doing the same. The two countries therefore provide ideal locations for comparing how humanitarian organizations frame their official roles and responsibilities in different political contexts, how aid workers on the ground adopt or transform these framings in the course of everyday aid work, and what refugees expect from humanitarian organizations. In order to pursue these questions, the researcher will conduct twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork based in Amman and Beirut.

This project proposes, however, that looking at a single social network instead of the entirety of someone's social interactions limits our understanding of cooperative behavior, and may even give us the wrong answer. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, explores social network data from multiple domains. The project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations, officials, and scientists engaged in identifying effective models for international development.

The project proposes that the amount of overlap between an individual's different social networks will predict their cooperative behavior - both towards people they know and strangers. The project further proposes that the integration of social networks across a community will also account for cooperative behavior. This will help explain the often reported result that an individual's community is a primary determinant of their cooperative behavior. These results have great potential to help us understand changes in cooperative behaviors as societies change, and better foster cooperation in our own communities. The researcher will investigate these ideas in a set of communities that are expected to differ in the overlap of their social networks in an indigenous area of Guyana. Anthropological studies of cooperation and decision-making are typically situated in such small-scale societies, which because of their relatively homogeneity and historic insularity, tend to more effectively control for the variables being queried.

The research will be conducted by Dr. Meredith Welch-Devine (University of Georgia) and Dr. Brian J. Burke (Appalachian State University), anthropologists affiliated with the NSF-supported Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program in southern Appalachia. Drawing on more than 80 years of data, Coweeta scientists have developed projections of future environmental change in the region and have outlined anticipated effects on local biodiversity and ecosystems. Their scientific findings provide a rich resource for local environmental governance and adaptation planning. In parallel, local non-scientist residents of the same region have gathered their own experiential data on biodiversity and change, transmitting it across generations and developing their own theories of its causes and consequences. Unfortunately, such local theories are rarely studied systematically even though they can be contribute significantly to science and to improved policy making. Place-based theories enhance science findings by connecting broad-scale changes to specific locations and micro-level change processes, as well as to the livelihoods, landscapes, and issues that move people to act. Because lay theories can significantly shape how we as a society respond and adapt to the changes around us, it is important to understand where local knowledge comes from and how it is affected by local history, economy, and culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coweeta region provides an ideal venue for such an investigation because of the availability of comparative scientific data. Also, the region is home to a mix of long-term and newcomer populations with different ways of engaging the natural world. For some residents, nature provides their livelihood, while others have been drawn to the area by its scenic beauty and recreation opportunities. Recognizing that plants and animals are central to people's experiences of their environment, the researchers have chosen to focus on perceptions of biodiversity. They will construct a sample of 90 local residents stratified by how long they and their families have lived in the area (multi-generational residents, one or two generation residents, and newcomers). The researchers will conduct life history and environmental interaction interviews with all members of the sample. An additional 45 residents will be asked to complete comprehensive freelisting exercises to elicit their cognitive models of the natural world, which will be complemented with follow-up interviews focused on changes in the freelisted items. The researchers will also conduct semi-structured interviews with resource managers and environmental policy makers; analyze official documents for differential inclusion of local and scientific knowledge and concerns in policy making; and conduct participant observation at relevant community events. Findings will document how local non-scientists experience and understand the same environmental changes that Coweeta scientists are measuring and recording. Parallel research, funded elsewhere, is being conducted in France, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon; data will be analyzed at the country level and then across the four countries through synthesis workshops.

The conference will foster networking and collaboration among an international assemblage of geologists, geographers, and soil scientists whose research interests focus on loess, which is an eolian sediment largely consisting of wind-blown silt.  Because of its distinctive character and origin, loess has been the topic of considerable research in geography, geomorphology, and soil science.  The conference will bring together scholars from around the world to share results from recent research, discuss topics and issues of mutual interest, and provide opportunities for scholars to explore possibilities for new collaborative relationships.  Although a series of conferences focusing on loess have been convened periodically since 1999, this will be the first such gathering in North America.  The conference will provide an opportunity to highlight much of the loess research in the mid-continental U.S. being done by U.S. researchers to an international audience, and it will provide a venue within which many Americans, who often do not interact directly with loess scholars in Europe and China, to meet, network, and collaborate.  In addition to facilitating interactions among scholars from different nations, the conference will catalyze advances in loess science that will enable better mapping and use of the distinctive soils associated with loess, and it will promote research in loess areas that have received little research attention in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the soils in the richest agricultural parts of the world are formed in loess, which means that research about the geology and spatial properties of loess provides important information about past geologic and climatic conditions wherever it is found.  The conference is expected to attract between 125 and 150 scholars, and it will be one of a number of gatherings preceding the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver.  The conference will be conducted over four days, with two days in meeting rooms and two days at field sites where scholars will be able to examine representative loess-based features firsthand.  Topics of special emphasis during indoor and field-based discussions will be on fluvial and glacial systems as loess sources; on the role of loess in regions with only thin veneers of wind-blown sediments; and on loess landscapes, eolian transportational systems, and the concept of loess transport surfaces.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZF7Ng_4AAAAJ,"['soils', 'geomorphology', 'loess', 'Quaternary science']",7597,45,130,85,125,135,187,178,251,226,243,331,311,412,473,456,553,507,557,116,91,56,607,496,424,59

For most of human history, anthropogenic effects on forest ecosystems unfolded slowly over long periods of time. But now scientists are observing changes in forest cover that occur over mere decades, dramatically accelerated by such human activities as large-scale agriculture and road construction. With growing concern over the loss of biodiversity worldwide, scientific research on global land use change has emphasized the environmentally destructive impacts of human colonization and settlement, especially in the tropics where recent human arrivals often lack the institutions and techniques to counter the effects of commercial agriculture and logging and keep forests standing. However, while some scientists have modeled deforestation as the direct result of the expansion of agriculture, others have argued that not all farming is the same and that small-scale agroecological farming methods can actually reduce deforestation and enhance biodiversity while still using the forests productively. A critical question for forest ecosystems is how the social organization of livelihoods and institutions can encourage new relationships to emerge between agriculture and biodiversity. To date, research on socio-ecological systems has tended to focus on traditional environmental management, paying less attention to shifts between types of land use as a function of evolving social organization on market peripheries. But better knowledge of these latter dynamics is critically needed: U.S. and state policies for mitigating climate change involve international incentives to reduce tropical deforestation but lack necessary understanding of social and livelihood development processes for the populations that inhabit the forests. <br/><br/>To further these understandings, this project will analyze an observed change in tropical forest cover that counters conventional wisdom: unusually, it involves a transition from deforestation to reforestation, rather than the other way around, despite having been subject to colonization since 1970. Davenport will assess how livelihoods, institutional arrangements, and cultivation decisions have variously impacted land use changes in time and space. The site of the research is the municipality of Medicil閼烘姧dia on the TransAmazon highway in Brazil, which has seen many of its small farmer majority population develop manual labor intensive and species diverse agroforestry systems with cacao trees (Theobroma cacao) and a閼剧禈i palms (Euterpe oleracea). While deforestation has continued apace in other areas of Medicil閼烘姧dia located farther from the highway, most land inside a ten kilometer range, deforested a quarter-century ago, is today either a forest farm or a regrowth secondary forest. The researcher will compare socio-ecological interactions on farms with distinct land use change trajectories. Three questions will be used to guide the analysis. First, how have the rural poor adapted distinct livelihood strategies over time, and involving what labor, logistical, subsistence and commercial arrangements? Second, how have institutions, colonist outlooks and attitudes shaped rules and norms concerning the land? The latter involves land tenure rights, local social organization and the evolving relationship of the locality with state agencies and regulatory systems, including the national Brazilian forest code. Third, how have agroecological techniques and species cultivation decisions varied in relation to livelihood and institutional factors, and what land use change has resulted? Quantitative and qualitative datasets will be constructed using survey, ethnographic and ethnobotanical methods; these will be integrated with remote sensing analysis of 30 years of satellite images and aerial photography to map and model human shaping of the environment over time.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a-6YqsUAAAAJ,,2072,17,,11,19,16,24,27,38,36,37,52,121,108,140,117,143,139,187,,,,238,262,287,25

Cities such as Rochester, New York, were bolstered by the success of companies like Eastman-Kodak. While these industries no longer employ tens of thousands of workers as film has been obsolesced by digital imaging, their impact on these communities remains palpable and enduring. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores how the chemical photography industry transformed these regions socially, economically, and environmentally.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ali Feser, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago, will investigate how chemical photography has endured in social life, in the memories of workers, and in regional ecology. First, this project will examine how displaced workers discuss Kodak's impact on social life and the local landscape, and how they understand the changes in imaging technology and the global economy that contributed to Kodak's decline. Second, through engagement with workers, public health experts, and environmentalists, this project will explore the practices of industrial chemistry and waste management that transformed the regional ecology. The researcher will undertake twenty-four months of field research in Rochester, employing a variety of social science methodologies, including participant-observation, interviews, oral histories, genealogies, archival research, and collaborations with local scientists and other experts.

Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such as IVF can be heavily leveraged and regulated by governments with protonalist policy objectives; and depending on who avails themselves of these reproductive technologies, those policies can have significant demographic impacts. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores what social, cultural, and demographic changes result from the use of state-sponsored medical technologies by ethnic minorities faced with social pressure reproduce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safak Kilictepe, under the supervision of Dr. Sarah Phillips of Indiana University will conduct research on the relationship between IVF and ethnic-minority status. The research is situated in a context that allows the researcher to investigate how infertile ethnic minority women living in socio-politically changing environments experience their infertility. The researcher will explore how ethnic minority women, who live in societies in which women's socioeconomic status significantly depends on their fertility, respond to and make use of government regulated IVF technology to achieve their own reproductive interests and validate their own gendered identities as women and mothers. The research will take place in Turkey, one of the world's fastest growing and tightly regulated IVF markets. The researcher will conduct twelve months of ethnographic research in the capital city (four months) and a southeastern city (eight months) dominated by a Kurdish minority population in Turkey.

These infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on the global movement of goods and peoples. The global systems that deliver these resources, however, are inevitably funneled through bottlenecks or ""chokepoints"", such as canals, tunnels, maritime straights, border crossings, etc. Constricting the flow of materials and people, such chokepoints are both vital to national and economic interests, and uniquely vulnerable, dynamic, and prone to disturbances. Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, and communities have taken a keen interest in securing and regulating these sites. Little is known, however, about how these passageways actually work. This collaborative project seeks to explore how local communities, environments, and infrastructures interact to allow passage through these sites (or not), as well how ordinary (and sometimes extraordinary) events at chokepoints affect economic systems, security, and lives well beyond these points of passage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Middleton and Gabriela Valdivia of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Carse of Vanderbilt University, Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Elizabeth Dunn of Indiana University, and Jason Cons of the University of Texas at Austin, will explore six chokepoints around the world.

The researchers will utilize extensive interviews, observation, and first-person engagement with officials, workers, and chokepoint residents in order to understand the distinctly human dimensions of these transit zones. Bringing together data from around the world, this study will provide a strategic reassessment of the global movement of goods, information, and people by examining these vital and dynamic points of national and world interest.

Archaeology provides a unique window through which researchers and the general public alike can come to understand how colonialism and long-term struggles for political and economic power affect the daily lives of individuals and groups, both locally and on a broad regional scale. This research is particularly relevant in today's global political climate, in which ethnic, religious, and national identities bear significant impact on access to land, resources, and opportunities.  This project will contribute to a better understanding of these issues on a broad scale because investigations of colonialism crosscut the social sciences, including anthropology, sociology, history, geography, economics, and political science.  In addition, the project will provide university students with educational opportunities and scientific training, and the field and laboratory experience gained on the project will fulfill students' degree requirements.  The data collected as part of this research will form the basis of Ms. Akmenkalns' doctoral dissertation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research on cross-cultural interactions has focused on large, urban populations, or it has focused on the strategies of colonizing powers.  While it is certainly important to examine how such interactions impact major centers and powerful political entities, it is also essential to investigate how rural communities experience changing power structures and how they construct their community identities in opposition to those of foreign cultural groups.  The following research questions guide this project:  1) What was the extent of Egyptian presence or influence in rural Nubia before and during Egyptian conquest of the region?  2) What was the importance of local and foreign cultural traditions in expressing cultural identity before and during the Egyptian conquest?  3) What differences, if any, were present in elite vs. non-elite and urban vs. rural expressions of cultural identity in the region?  To answer these questions, this project will employ archaeological excavations at the sites of Hannek and Abu Fatima, which are located in the hinterlands of the ancient kingdom of Kerma in northern Sudan.  Researchers will investigate the remains of houses, public buildings, and tombs to examine ancient diet and health, as well as the production and use of pottery, tools, jewelry, and architecture.  These artifact types are useful in understanding cultural identities because they are integral to daily life and the routine behaviors that structure those identities.

These infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on the global movement of goods and peoples. The global systems that deliver these resources, however, are inevitably funneled through bottlenecks or ""chokepoints"", such as canals, tunnels, maritime straights, border crossings, etc. Constricting the flow of materials and people, such chokepoints are both vital to national and economic interests, and uniquely vulnerable, dynamic, and prone to disturbances. Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, and communities have taken a keen interest in securing and regulating these sites. Little is known, however, about how these passageways actually work. This collaborative project seeks to explore how local communities, environments, and infrastructures interact to allow passage through these sites (or not), as well how ordinary (and sometimes extraordinary) events at chokepoints affect economic systems, security, and lives well beyond these points of passage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Middleton and Gabriela Valdivia of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Carse of Vanderbilt University, Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Elizabeth Dunn of Indiana University, and Jason Cons of the University of Texas at Austin, will explore six chokepoints around the world. Each member of the team is an expert in their region of study. Each will focus on a particular kind of chokepoint. These include: the Panama Canal, a tunnel in Russia, a land bridge in India, an oil-refinery and pipelines in Ecuador, a network of rivers in Bangladesh, and a maritime strait leading into the Red Sea. The researchers will utilize extensive interviews, observation, and first-person engagement with officials, workers, and chokepoint residents in order to understand the distinctly human dimensions of these transit zones. Bringing together data from around the world, this study will provide a strategic reassessment of the global movement of goods, information, and people by examining these vital and dynamic points of national and world interest. The results will speak directly to current concerns over migration, security, and economic wellbeing.

NSF support will facilitate the participation of up to 50 scholars and graduate students from the U.S. and other countries.  The two conferences are aimed at stimulating research that draws from research communities that focus on human mobility and animal movement ecology.  These two communities previously have not interacted extensively, so the conferences are expected to facilitate interactions across the research domains to enhance understanding of frameworks, approaches, and methods that are useful in studying varied complex, dynamic, spatiotemporal systems.  The conferences will provide opportunities to share latest research and advance knowledge about understanding spatial behaviors and integrating research opportunities between the two domains.  The conferences will stimulate research that ranges across a broad range of topics, including disease spread; social networks; information diffusion and its impacts on privacy and identity; knowledge transfer, and urban, social, and ecosystem dynamics.  They also will facilitate scientific collaboration among young, underrepresented researchers who may not ordinarily have such networking opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These conferences will bring together a unique blend of scholars from the human mobility community, such as transportation, urban science, sociology, and public health and those researchers associated with movement ecology, a nascent but growing research area in the ecological sciences.

But anthropologists have documented many cases where groups of human beings find other methods for pursuing sovereignty than through the formation of autonomous nation-states. This project asks what factors influence human beings to seek sovereignty through means other than political independence. The project would aid public policy experts in their efforts to understand and anticipate social movements not only in the United States, where this research is taking place, but in other parts of the world where sovereignty claims have taken new form. In addition, the project would strengthen collaboration among scientists in the mainland U.S. and Puerto Rico, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and train undergraduate and graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Yarimar Bonilla of Rutgers University explores how notions of citizenship and national identity are reimagined within contexts of shifting and disputed forms of sovereignty. The research explores the Puerto Rican statehood movement, an important site for answering this question as the movement has paradoxically gained popularity among those who have advocated other forms of sovereign status over annexation and statehood. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States has long been ambiguous and misunderstood. Famously described as ""foreign in a domestic sense,"" Puerto Rico is a space where notions of citizenship nationality are hotly debated. For many years the island's commonwealth status promised local residents ""the best of both worlds"" in the sense of offering US citizenship with a measure of local sovereignty. However, as the economy has stagnated over the past twenty years leading to failing infrastructure, a seemingly unpayable public debt, and historic levels of out-migration (resulting in a larger concentration of Puerto Ricans in the continental United States than in the Puerto Rican territory), a growing number of Puerto Ricans currently support political annexation to the United States. This project will examines how and why a large number of Puerto Ricans advocate for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state. Utilizing data collected through archival research, participant observation, surveys, focus groups and individual interviews, the PI will examine how statehood is imagined by its advocates and what problems it is deemed capable of solving. The findings of this research will have broad implications for thinking about the cultural meanings of citizenship in an era of shifting sovereignty and about the current landscape of political possibility in the United States and its margins.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=H_khxncAAAAJ,"['Anthropology', 'Caribbean Studies', 'American Studies', 'Sovereignty']",3141,15,,,,,,,,,,13,15,52,120,192,339,335,435,,,,513,524,488,38

Jones (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) and Dr. Arthur D. Murphy (University of North Carolina, Greensboro), investigates the effects of community networks on individual and family responses to mass trauma and extreme events. Mass trauma events, such as public venue shootings and bombings, linger in people's lives long after the events themselves. They also tie together former strangers and do so in ways that significantly affect the recovery process for both individuals and communities. The goal of the research is to understand how different networked groups develop, how they change over time, and how those changes affect and are affected by their reaction to the events and their aftermath. Because this is a dynamic process that begins right after an event takes place and unfolds over years, Jones and Murphy have taken a  longitudinal approach: a sustained, focused, long-term investigation of how social groups emerge, coalesce, and divide, as well as how they affect and are affected by their contexts and memberships, during the recovery process.  Their focal event is a 2009 fire that broke out in a Hermasillo, Mexico, day care center and killed 49 young children while also injuring many more. This award supports a third round of data collection and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will map out the formal named groups of local residents and affected families and the informal sub-networks (calculated with hierarchical clustering) among parents and caretakers. They also will conduct in-depth interviews and participant observation (such as attending marches, meetings, commemorations) to understand how the different subgroups generate diverse meanings and pathways to recovery over time. The network data will be analyzed with formal network modeling measures of embeddedness and bridging. The interview data will be coded for analysis with text analysis software. Preliminary findings suggest that while participation in a network of people who shared and understood their experience sometimes afforded a support advantage, this was not always true. Jones and Murphy will explore the sources of disagreement and conflict, how these affect recovery, and what produces exceptions where these conflicts and individual problems like guilt, depression, fear and helplessness are overcome. This project builds new links between the fields of community psychology and anthropology in disaster and trauma studies. It also brings insights on impact and recovery to a broader audience of political scientists interested in extreme events and governance, geographers who study hazards and vulnerability, and sociologists  concentrating on disasters and social organization. Better knowledge of social aspects of coping in mass trauma events is important for counselors, as well as public officials and policy makers who must help those who struggle to find meaning and justice post-trauma.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kp6D9FYAAAAJ,"['human ecosystems', 'wellbeing', 'cross-cultural research', 'disaster recovery', 'economic anthropology']",1455,20,6,6,18,22,14,19,21,37,50,55,83,64,93,104,126,119,136,,,12,145,143,139,17

Previous studies have underlined the potential of this region to document early dispersals of modern humans, Neandertals and perhaps Denisovans along the Eurasian steppe belt. It is assumed, however, that it was particularly challenging for incoming human groups to adapt to the Late Pleistocene environmental setting. Starting from about 120,000 years ago and until the end of the Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, the climate became increasingly unstable with sharp changes in temperature and moisture occurring at an accelerating pace. Hence some scholars have suggested that the peopling of regions with continental climate, such as Mongolia, would be highly dependent on the global variation in temperature and moisture. Climate improvements would favor demographic increases among human populations and trigger range expansions into territories that remained out of reach during the coldest periods. Other scholars argued that humans have been able to cope with challenging environments in most regions of Eurasia before the Late Pleistocene and climate change would have only little effect on population dynamics. These different views illustrate a lack of consensus regarding the impact that climate change had on the peopling of regions such as Europe, Central and Northeast Asia where human responses to such constraints are still poorly understood. The research holds broad significance because it sets within a deep chronological context the interaction between human behavior and climate variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Zwyns and his research team will address this issue by building up a high-resolution archeological and environmental sequence for North Mongolia. The research includes targeted excavations and sample collection at Paleolithic sites located along the tributaries of the Selenga River. The Selenga flows to the Northeast and connects Mongolia with Lake Baikal. Its drainage system has yielded the highest concentration of relevant archeological sites in Mongolia and in Siberia and holds one of the richest records for Northeast Asia. Through the analyses of sediments, fauna and using radiometric dating methods, an international team of an archeologist, a geologist, a zooarcheologist, and two geochronologists, along with other specialists will reconstruct the environmental history in and around the Paleolithic sites to better understand the environment in which humans first settled. The goal is to correlate several archeological sites and to build a solid reference sequences for a region where changes in material culture and in the environment can be observed throughout the last 50,000 years. Because it exhibits an extreme continental climate, North Mongolia is suited for studies of human response to sharp changes in climate.

Critics claim that this transformation represents a new era of enclosures and constitutes a ""global land grab,"" which has negative effects on social equity and environmental sustainability. Advocates acknowledge the impacts of the changes but argue in turn that agricultural commodity production represents the most efficient use of the resource base in many developing countries, and their best hope for economic modernization. Social scientists who seek to understand the impacts of these transformations on rural people have likewise been divided. Many studies have focused on the economic marginalization that accompanies loss of land and the transition from mixed subsistence economies to dependence on wage labor. Yet some researchers have demonstrated that various indicators of well-being in fact improve as rural residents become more integrated with national markets. This award supports scientific research on this debate: Is agricultural conversion and restructuring good for local people or not? Because this process occurs throughout the world, including in the United States where it has been ongoing for over a century, it is important to have a better understanding of its consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will use Cambodia as a manageable and appropriate test case; there, smallholder farmers have lost their traditional resource base and have been relegated to the in-between spaces at the edges of the new enclosures. Dr. Jonathan Padwe (University of Hawai'i at M闁肩儤濮a) will survey land-use patterns and well-being across a series of highland villages. He will collect data to inform both sides of the debate: fine-scaled study of land-holding, resource use, and social differentiation as well as data on nutrition, well-being, and household economy.  The study will make synchronic and diachronic measurements of the impact of new land regimes. Synchronic analysis involves the study of land use and well-being across a range of villages, from those that are directly affected to those that are indirectly affected. Diachronic analysis involves the comparative study of land use and well-being in a single village where ten-year longitudinal data are available.

Focusing on a case study of the 2016 World Conservation Congress, the project examines how notions of the ""green economy"", such as those inscribed in the UNEP-led Green Economy Initiative, are shaping global environmental conservation practices. As part of a coordinated effort among researchers from multiple universities, countries, and disciplines, the project strengthens multi-national research, training, and teaching partnerships in producing policy-relevant scientific research. It integrates research and education through cascade mentoring, which includes senior and junior scholars and graduate and undergraduate students, from two liberal arts colleges and a large research university in the development of innovative methodology and theory-building in global environmental governance. Through rigorous theoretical and methodological training for graduate and undergraduate students, the project helps them to develop the skills and knowledge to apply geographic concepts and methods to pressing global environmental issues, while simultaneously exposing them to potential careers in environmental research and policy. By illuminating the complexities of how actors influence global environmental governance, it reveals avenues for redressing seemingly intractable environmental crises and global inequality at a critical historical moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project challenges state-centric understandings of global environmental governance and advances new theories about how contemporary governance occurs. It augments traditional field-based studies of conservation with ethnographic data in order to trace how paradigm shifts occur in global conservation politics. Specifically, the project analyzes how global conservation governance transpires across multiple institutional sites by focusing on international conferences as key venues in which diverse actors, who are normally dispersed in time and space, convene to negotiate. It attends to the types of strategies that diverse actors use and the ways in which conference norms, structures, forms of acceptable knowledge and measurement shape the ways in which these actors interact and influence negotiations, revealing how and why certain actors are better able than others to catalyze paradigm shifts. Ultimately, it documents how paradigm shifts occur not only through official discourse, policy and law, but also through more informal, everyday interactions among public, private and non-profit actors.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bWf8GMcAAAAJ,"['Political Ecology', 'Global Environmental Governance', 'Collaborative Event and Institutional Ethnography']",2406,20,,,,,,,9,23,55,106,153,161,165,194,223,220,250,,,,274,240,266,19

These statistical methods will enable researchers to assess risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer, and other health outcomes, such as pre-term births, as a function of the geographic-specific exposures associated with residential history.  The new statistical methods will provide researchers with a robust and powerful tool for using residential histories when they test hypotheses about geographic exposures over time and space and their impacts on health and disease.  The project will increase basic understanding of the amount of information bias introduced when residential histories are ignored.  Project results will provide empirical examples for geographers, public officials, and other scientists that demonstrate why residential history data should be used in health and disease surveillance systems, how these data can be incorporated, and why this information should be included when conducting health geographic analysis.  Project methods and findings will assist those addressing a broader set of health-related issues.  The use of the data from a state cancer registry and a birth registry will provide insights regarding the use of administrative databases to obtain residential histories for health geographic analysis.  The new methods will be adaptable for use by researchers and by public health practitioners and medical personnel in addressing problems besides long-latency diseases.  By analyzing daily-scale movement, for example, it will be possible to map acute diseases like salmonella or health events like asthma attacks.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in health and medical geography, computer science, and epidemiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common methods for assessing risk factors based on geographic-specific exposures or the clustering of health and disease events generally have relied on static data limited to a single point in time and space, such as a person's location at the time of diagnosis.  Ignoring residential history is a significant shortcoming in such analyses because of the latency period between causative exposures and resulting health and disease events.  The investigators will address this shortcoming by providing a framework for combining multipoint, longitudinal residential history data with health and disease data that is normally based on a single time point.  Building upon previous research in health geography, geographical information sciences, and data mining, they will develop hierarchical Bayes models that assess risk of disease while accounting for latency and temporally changing social and environmental exposures, geographic uncertainty, and missing data.

Project outcomes will be valuable in identifying the ecological legacies of low-intensity land use and for identifying reference conditions and baseline data for ecological restoration.  The project will provide valuable education and training opportunities for undergraduate students enrolled at a primarily undergraduate institution and will foster professional development of early career science educators.  The investigators will actively collaborate with Native American tribal resource managers and will conduct outreach activities for sharing outcomes with land-resource management communities and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhancing knowledge about the extent of human influence on fire regimes of past millennia has important implications for the understanding and management of fire-adapted vegetation communities in the U.S. and around the world.  Bark-peeled pine can provide a compelling context of land use to inform interpretations of an extensive and growing fire history and forest age structure.  The investigator will use dendrochronological dating of peel scars on trees in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness to provide the first absolutely dated and spatially precise record of Ojibwe land use in the Great Lakes region.  Parametric and non-parametric tests will be performed to compare fire frequency, fire synchrony, and spatial association of areas of high fire frequency with peel-scar occurrence in order to ascertain the association between human and fire activity.  Collaboration with archaeologists will provide the cultural context for the tree-ring data and will enable a direct examination of the influence people had on the fire regimes and vegetation communities of this wilderness area.  The results of this work will establish a new understanding of the role of people in the pre-European landscape that will help guide future research and management in the Great Lakes Region and throughout temperate forest regions of the world.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Pnayjk8AAAAJ,"['Forest Ecology', 'Biogeography', 'Traditional Ecological Knowledge', 'Fire Ecology']",792,15,,,4,3,3,11,8,21,33,23,34,34,57,57,78,58,60,,,,101,96,99,6

Urban planners often confront competing interests of different constituent groups in their efforts to balance the need to modernize infrastructures with fostering of employment for the urban poor. Conversions of garbage dumps to modern sanitary landfills, for example, may reduce hazards to public health at the same time they threaten the livelihoods of thousands of people who rely on waste picking and recycling for survival. The contestations that take place over the right to the dump cut to the heart of urban citizenship and the poor's rights to the city and public space. This project will investigate how various stakeholder groups differently understand and value waste infrastructures and evaluate the labor implications of upgrades to sanitation facilities. In so doing, it will advance understanding of the infrastructure planning process, urban citizenship, and the means through which the urban poor contest projects that threaten their livelihoods. Research results will have valuable implications for planners, policymakers, and social justice advocates addressing the challenges posed by infrastructure modernization in cities of the Global South.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on a case study of a planned sanitation upgrade that has spawned an organized protest movement by waste pickers in Dakar, Senegal. Dakar is an ideal setting for this research because of its long history of peaceful, multi-party democracy, its long tradition of urban citizenship movements, and recent trends to ""clean up"" undesirable places and informal laborers. Dakar's sprawling dump, Mbeubeuss, is one of the oldest and largest landfills in Africa.  Though the government plan to upgrade the infrastructure has been frustrated over the last few years by protests, under pressure from its funder the World Bank, efforts are underway to push the upgrade forward in the next two years.  Through ethnographic research with key stakeholders, including government planners and waste pickers, the research will examine the planning process during this time as a window into material struggles around urban citizenship and the rights of the city's poorest. Extensive interviews, participant observation, and participatory mapping will be conducted in order to reveal the different spatial and material relations represented by the two infrastructures, how actors' contested visions for the dump are embedded in their material practices (e.g. recycling processes versus office work), and the forms of expert and vernacular knowledge marshaled by each group.  Special attention will be paid to the way that picker activists contest the authoritative knowledge of planning through their alternative development discourses and practices of civic science.  Contributing to debates in political infrastructures, geographies of waste, urban political ecology, and the politics of environmental knowledge, the research will show the material basis of urban citizenship and lend insight into strategies for more pro-poor infrastructure planning.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Gj0Qda0AAAAJ,"['Medical student education', 'sociopolitical and ethical aspects of medical student education', 'psychiatric education']",2554,23,43,80,92,90,94,87,121,82,115,126,125,87,99,81,76,79,64,39,54,70,47,62,46,2

Although many individual invasive plants have been studied extensively, basic understanding of the biogeography of invasive plants as a broader group remains limited.  This research project will analyze and project the geographies of invasive plants in their non-native ranges within the continental U.S.  The investigators will compare the geographic traits of invasive species to those of non-native species that are established but are not known to be spreading or negatively affecting natural systems.  Project results will enhance fundamental knowledge of unique biogeographical patterns of invasive plants in their non-native range; knowledge that is critical for forecasting invasion risk.  The project will provide new insights regarding how geography influences the factors affecting the spread of new species into ecosystems in the invaded range, including identifying ""hot spots"" of future invasion risk.  The investigators will create spatially explicit invasion risk models for the nation to guide policy and management, and they will produce state-level ""watch lists"" of invasive plants likely to become problematic under potential future climate conditions.  The project also will contribute to improved education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields through graduate training and expansion of undergraduate participation in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive species have been identified as one of five prominent threats to global ecosystems by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.  Despite the prominence of the problem, there is a paucity of basic scientific understanding regarding what sets these species apart, especially why invasive species are invasive.  Considerable effort has gone into addressing this question through ecological studies, but relatively few researchers have focused on understanding the geography of invasive species.  Invasive plant research tends to be biased towards a handful of very well-studied species, which inhibits understand of invasion patterns more generally.  Furthermore, lumping invasive and established species together conflates the influence of human introduction with the influence of biology on the geographic distributions of invasions, thereby hindering identification of patterns characteristic of invasives.  This project will focus on evaluating the validity of answers to two core sets of questions:  (1) For non-native plants in the continental U.S., how does non-native range geography differ for plants that are established vs. those that are invasive? (2) What is the current geography of establishment and invasion risk across the U.S., and how might they shift with changing climatic conditions?  The investigators will use occurrence records for invasive plants compiled from museum and management records to model potential distribution for all 1,000 invasive plants under current and projected future climate conditions.

Urban water provision is an assemblage of water vendors, networked pipes, plastic jugs, standpipes, water meters, rainwater and greywater collection tanks, and water trucks that convey and manage domestic water provision to help households cope and meet needs of everyday life. This project examines how and why urban households obtain water through these hybrid infrastructure systems and tests their efficacy in terms of household water security, defined as reliable, adequate and affordable water for a healthy life, using a scaled metric developed by the investigator. The project will be conducted in metropolitan Fortaleza, Brazil, where domestic water provision reflects typical configurations of water provision in the developing world.  Research outcomes will provide meaningful insights as to the benefits and limitations of hybrid water-provisioning systems and inform development interventions, technological innovations for water provision, and infrastructure investments. Investigators will create a publicly available online portal to disseminate project information and photos, research findings, and a computational tool to standardize the household water security metric for cross-regional comparisons, allowing researchers to examine impacts of household water insecurity on diverse areas such as public health and water infrastructure planning. The project will also deepen research networks between Brazilian and US researchers, broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science through its research design, and contribute to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce by training one computer science undergraduate and one geography graduate student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of regulated and unregulated water provisioning systems begs the question of its efficacy for human development and water security: Do hybrid urban water systems increase or decrease household water security? What particular configuration of formal and informal technologies and practices enhances or reduces household water security? How do different hybrid water-provisioning systems compare in terms of household water security? The major social scientific contribution of this project is to answer these questions by employing a mix of qualitative (observation; open-ended and semi-structured interviews), participatory (photovoice), and quantitative (survey) methods. The investigator will describe and develop a typology of water provision, assess how households interact with the existing systems, and measure household-level water security in selected urban communities. The household water security metric calculated from the survey data can be used to statistically test and model the relationship of water insecurity to several factors, including water-provisioning type, income, education, and health. This project will provide new empirical data to engage larger theoretical debates on the benefits of coexistence, the efficacy of centralized, piped water networks as the modern ideal of water provision, and urban water governance, more broadly.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=A6hAEcsAAAAJ,"['Geography', 'political ecology', 'water security', 'water governance']",4255,36,,,20,19,46,64,73,73,107,133,110,129,169,219,180,302,463,,,,616,601,771,103

The shift to shallow tube wells, however, has exposed tens of millions of people to arsenic, which causes cancer and other health problems. Groundwater arsenic is a major problem in several countries in the Americas and Asia. One mitigation approach has been for households to switch to deep public tube wells that are mostly &gt;500 feet deep because they tap water in an aquifer that is low in arsenic. Although deep tube wells are being installed to reduce exposure to arsenic, the health effects of switching to these often more distant, wells has not been adequately investigated. A concern is that water obtained from a distant well may be stored for a longer period of time in the home, thereby increasing the risk of microbial contamination by extended handling and use. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of whether deep tube wells installed through arsenic mitigation programs are a safe drinking water source in countries groundwater arsenic problem. It also provides insights about the circumstances in which household drinking water storage containers are most likely to be contaminated with waterborne pathogens. Lastly, the study develops a rich database on water, sanitation, hygiene that will be made available and can be linked to another large survey on the health, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics of the same study population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study integrates theory and methods from the disease ecology tradition of medical geography and environmental microbiology. It combines geographic and environmental microbiology methods with community surveys to provide information that is critical for developing drinking water policies and programs. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine if deep tube wells protect against diarrheal diseases compared to shallow tube wells, (2) compare the microbial water quality of deep and shallow tube well sources and from household storage containers with water from those wells, and (3) determine if longer travel distance and time to deep tube wells leads to longer duration of water storage, poor water quality in storage containers, and higher diarrheal disease incidence. The study will be conducted in Bangladesh where groundwater arsenic is most severe. A household survey will determine water source, use, storage, hygiene, and sanitation practices. The microbial water quality of tube wells and household water storage containers will be measured for the presence and concentrations of E. coli as fecal indicator bacteria. Distance to tube wells will be measured using a geographic information system database that includes households and tube wells. The analysis will determine if distance/travel time/storage time is related to water quality in storage containers and diarrheal diseases.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=R9pcKp4AAAAJ,,8397,53,,33,62,86,94,135,160,231,315,394,410,507,513,576,630,679,773,,,,950,800,802,91

As datasets are merged across varying spatial scales, statistical biases, commonly known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) occur and are impacted by the composition and configuration of the datasets.  The investigator will study how these biases can be overcome in order to allow datasets to be accurately scaled to different resolutions.  By developing methods that use measures of compositional and configurational heterogeneity, the researcher will provide new insights regarding how to assess the potential of a dataset to be accurately scaled to coarser and finer resolutions in order to foster integration.  The investigator will raise awareness of accuracy issues surrounding appropriate and correct use of ecological, social, and geographical datasets for integrated analysis, and she will offer solutions to promote better interdisciplinary integration as well as methods for exposing young scientists to these issues through learning modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the spatial sciences by drawing on parallel theories in geography and landscape ecology.  The research will seek to answer three core questions: (1) How do data complexity and spatial heterogeneity impact statistical biases associated with MAUP?  (2) Can standards for data reduction/complexity improve prediction?  (3) Do various landscape paradigms respond differently to changing heterogeneity?  The investigator will use multiple methods, including innovations in surface paradigms in the field of landscape ecology, advances in remote sensing spectral unmixing, and scale-dependency of spatial pattern metrics to answer these questions.  The research findings will result in identification of different forms of data reduction and complexity aggregation methods across multiple resolutions; development of a rapid assessment method for predicting downscaling accuracy; and establishment of a statistical basis for using the emerging continuous surface paradigm of landscape analyses.

Yet research on primate olfaction (sense of smell) lags behind studies of other senses such as vision and hearing.  Understanding how scents communicate information, what reactions they produce, and how this information is chemically communicated, can improve our understanding of primate behaviors and motivation. In order to measure and characterize primate scents, researchers have used laboratory methods that require large, high-cost equipment and sample preservation during shipment from a field site. In this high-risk project, the investigators will test a portable field method for characterizing the chemical composition of scents in real time. If the field method is feasible, it will allow new avenues of research that could advance the understanding of olfactory communication in primates and other mammals.

This temporary migration and resulting encounters with different people and ways of life in the city has countless unintended consequences particularly for those from marginalized groups.  As they leave their homes for major urban centers, they may experience increased exclusion but also may find new freedoms and a sense of cosmopolitan, national, and even transnational identity. As these youth complete their education or drop out, return to their homes or seek employment elsewhere, their migration experiences will alter relations between these members of marginalized groups and the nation-state. Geographers are well placed to investigate how young people from minority communities in remote regions experience urban migration and higher education; how they adapt to cultural difference and how this experience in turn affects their lives, their home communities and their understanding of belonging to the nation. This project will provide insight into crucial questions about how migration and higher education in the city informs the social aspirations and political identities of minority youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a multi-sited study of higher education-driven migration in South Asia, a region of critical geopolitical importance, this research will develop theoretical frameworks and methodologies for understanding a) the social and cultural impacts of migration for higher education ? both for students and home communities; b) how daily life in an urban university context shapes the individual, collective, and territorial understandings of minority identity; and c) the central role that higher education plays in youth politics. In addition to these conceptual contributions, this project will d) develop a new methodological approach for working with minority youth and building research capacity among this crucial population. Dr. Sara Smith and her research team will use focus groups, in-depth interviews, a household survey, and a participatory media project to meet these objectives. The project will advance Dr. Smith's geopolitics framework, which builds on advances in political geography to relate micro-scale experiences of daily life to macro-scale political phenomenon such as territorial conflict and nation-building. By bringing this framework to bear on migration, youth, and higher education, this project is expected to provide a new way to understand the relationship between minorities and the nation-state.

The workshop will open up opportunities for future multi-disciplinary research by supporting the formation of an umbrella organization for ongoing research in the region, strengthening linkages between researchers, and allowing members to develop collaborative research agendas. International students and early career researchers are also well represented, enhancing the network's capacity for future growth. A wider outcome of the workshop and network will be to inform decision-makers in the region of the results of on-going research, contributing scientifically robust evidence to better inform debate among policymakers and the public.

All Native American languages are endangered, and over 120 of these languages have gone silent, which means there are no remaining fluent first language speakers. Experts recognize around 7,000 languages worldwide, and they estimate at least half will fall silent by the end of this century.  Human language is highly complex and scientists have thus far only scratched the surface in analyzing and understanding the scientific diversity represented in the grammars of the individual 7,000 languages.  Because the number of languages far exceeds the number of trained language scientists, one challenge is to train more linguists.  Another challenge is reversing language endangerment, thus staunching the loss of languages, cultures and knowledge. Opportunities within linguistics that use informal science learning in linguistics, such as short workshops, conferences, and other training, have proven effective in addressing both challenges. One such project, the Breath of Life archival model, has been successful in engaging Native American citizen scientists to work with archival language documentation in repositories in California, Oklahoma and Washington, D.C.  This project will fund the 2017 National Breath of Life Archival Institute for Indigenous Languages (National BoL), the fourth of its kind since 2011.  Broader impacts include the training of Native American citizen scientists to work on their own tribe's language and the training of linguistics graduate students, who serve as mentors and learn from their experiences how to produce documentation that is both better and more relevant and useful to community language efforts. The general public, other tribal members and interested scholars will also benefit from access to the newly digitized archival materials from the Smithsonian Institution's holdings created as part of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-hosted by the Smithsonian's National Anthropological Archives and National Museum of the American Indian, and the Library of Congress, the National BoL will last two weeks and introduce linguistics and the language sciences. Participants are grouped by their heritage language, with each group assigned an academically trained linguist for one-on-one mentoring in the analysis of archival materials in that language. Ultimately, these efforts by citizen scientists will increase their linguistic understanding of their languages, to support reclamation and further investigation of the languages. The National BoL will train citizen scientists from some 15 language communities, bringing the cumulative number of languages investigated in these national workshops to over 70. By engaging community members in research, this workshop broadens the participation of Native Americans in the social sciences by investigating aspects of language that directly benefit community goals. Importantly, the 2017 National BoL will also use professional evaluators to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the extent to which training targeted at capacity building in archival research enables community members to address critical needs in sustaining languages and continue to contribute to the language sciences.  Finally, the informal science learning environment provided by the National BoL has the potential to show how it facilitates novel discoveries in linguistics as researchers engage with archival language documentation, while also training new cohorts of academic and community linguists.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bqcKYiIAAAAJ,,6914,15,343,371,290,305,283,321,300,298,267,307,261,236,230,235,258,242,236,309,278,343,195,197,151,11

The use of red and yellow ochre pigments for symbolic purposes is among the most widespread and persistent of human cultural behaviors. However, the study of archaeological ochre has been hindered by ambiguity over how to interpret this iron-based pigment in the absence of obvious symbolic applications such as cave or rock art. This project combines archaeological, geological, and ethnographic methods to investigate prehistoric through modern use of ochre pigments. The investigators have already conducted interviews with the Maasai and Samburu peoples of Kenya, many of whom still use ochre in their daily lives, and identified outcrops of ochre minerals that these groups exploit for symbolic and functional purposes. Geochemical techniques proven to be effective at telling apart ochre from different sources will be used to analyze samples collected from ochre deposits, and to match them to paint samples from rock art sites and ochre artifacts from archaeological sites in the region. This project will refine minimally destructive methods that can be used to analyze the composition of ochre and other iron-containing materials for anthropological, geological, materials science, and forensic applications. Improving techniques for determining the geographic and geologic origin of ochre pigments and related materials has significant implications for identifying looted heritage items and forgeries. The project will also provide opportunities for public science education via museum outreach, international collaborations, and mentoring in the STEM sciences for underrepresented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent discoveries of ochre pigments from Stone Age archaeological sites have shed light on the great temporal depth of human symbolic behavior. Our understanding of the evolutionary significance and potentially the meaning of ancient symbolism using pigments has been enhanced by novel geochemical techniques for provenance studies of ochre, particularly minimally destructive trace element fingerprinting by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry. The project builds on improvements in this method over the last decade by creating a database of trace element and stable isotope (strontium, lead, and iron) fingerprints for ochre sources currently or recently used by inhabitants of the Kenya Rift Valley. The Maasai and Samburu are among the few remaining peoples in East Africa with active rock art and ochre self-adornment traditions. They present the best opportunity for studying how modern humans interact with their geologic environment for symbolic purposes. Once completed, the source database will be used to determine the geologic provenance of ochre artifacts and rock art paints of Stone Age through recent origin that were sampled during field and museum research. This will allow for investigation of hypotheses about symbolically mediated versus least-cost (nearest source) models of mineral deposit exploitation, transport and trade of ochre pigments, and preferential use of specific pigment colors. In addition, the source fingerprint database will be made freely available online for other scientists to use in their own research upon completion of the project.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dIUvx1kAAAAJ,"['Archaeometry', 'Archaeological Chemistry', 'Materials Science', 'Isotope Geochemistry', 'LA-ICP-MS']",645,8,,,,,,,,,,,3,5,10,25,34,77,91,,,,103,123,146,14

As the basic social unit, household is a particularly apt arena for studying economic difference and for reconstructing the nature and degree of social inequality in early societies. Under the supervision of Dr. Elizabeth Arkush, doctoral candidate Peiyu Chen, of the University of Pittsburgh, will excavate the site of Huaca Negra on the Peruvian northern coast and undertake analysis of the recovered materials to investigate early social inequality from a household perspective. Through investigating practices of domestic activities, both commoners' and elites' everyday life can be studied, which offer the potential for examining the whole spectrum of social variation within a given society, and helps to reconstruct the nature and degree of social inequality. This project will incorporate US and Peruvian students from various universities and provide training in different archeological techniques and analysis. The information obtained, which will be the foundation for Chen's dissertation, will be digitalized and made available through the Center for Comparative Archaeology of the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous scholarship on the emergence of complex society in Andean prehistory has focused on monument construction, under the presumption that it requires leaders to organize large scale construction projects. The proposed research, however, attempts to shift attention away from magnificent public constructions towards understanding daily household practice. Huaca Negra, a Peruvian coastal site that was occupied from 5,000 to 3,000 B.P in the Viru Valley, had been identified by earlier researchers as a domestic midden mound, and its time span witnessed the emergence of large-scale monument construction on the Peruvian northern and central coast. This makes the site an ideal place to examine both household practices and the development of social inequality. The research will involve a program of excavation and analyses of unearthed materials. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be applied to discern the spatial distribution of resources, variation in abundance between households, and diversity in the proportion of different resources. This project will distinguish materials related to the subsistence economy (food), craft production (utilitarian goods) and social networks (trade goods), providing a window onto the process by which certain households might be able to gain unequal access to resources and started to accumulate power to support their leadership.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AMe8pSwAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'Andes', 'violence and warfare', 'GIS', 'drone photogrammetry']",1609,18,,5,7,17,24,39,27,36,64,79,63,91,147,121,152,102,139,,,,144,130,192,8

Different parts (""articulators"") modify the airflow to create speech sounds. Since many articulators are hidden from view when the speech sounds are produced, linguists have found other devices to investigate where and how articulators operate.  This is important because different sounds can be meaningful in a particular language. For example, ""p"" and ""b"" are different sounds in English since ""pit"" and ""bit"" mean different things. Instrumental tools like ultrasound and devices that measure oral-nasal airflow enable the precise articulation of speech sounds to be understood. As a result, sounds will be more accurately transcribed in language documentation and produced by learners.  Sound systems are also researched by collecting and analyzing the language used in more stylized ways, like rhyme or repeated consonant sounds (""alliteration"") in different genres. Understanding the sound system of a language is critical for compiling dictionaries, developing a systematic orthographic system and language teaching materials.  This project will document the speech sounds of a highly endangered language that has an unusually large number of sounds that are formed by curling the tip of the tongue up towards the hard palate (""retroflex""). Broader impacts include the production of linguistic and cultural materials for direct use by the endangered language community, the training of a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate students, and a new international collaboration with a local university and an NGO.

Kalasha is of linguistic importance in part due to its many retroflexed sounds, since the wide range of these and other speech sounds are found in less than 1% of the world's languages.  The project will document the phonetics and phonology of Kalasha through instrumental techniques like lingual ultrasound, and will use best practices in language documentation to compile an online dictionary and to transcribe oral literature (songs, short stories, narratives, poems). The researchers will also develop flexible speech analysis tools, and make data and findings available through existing cross-linguistic databases and archives. Lingual ultrasound and oral-nasal airflow are ideal methods for describing the retroflex consonants, and nasal and retroflex vowels of Kalasha. The instrumental phonetic investigation will enable a better understanding of these uncommon speech sounds and will generate an audio-video ultrasound corpus.

I閻㈩垳鎯畃iaq people of the northwest Alaskan coast today rely on marine mammal hunting for a large portion of their subsistence as they have for millennia, but it is uncertain how observed and expected changes in the marine ecosystem might affect future food security. Archaeology is uniquely situated to provide perspective on this problem because it can consider human activity over long periods of time, and investigate how past changes affected marine mammals and their human hunters. This research will examine if and how environmental variability in the Arctic over the past 2,000 years affected marine mammals that in turn influenced human hunting patterns. This project will compare evidence for changes in marine conditions and their timing to variation in human diet based on the remains of animal bones from archaeological sites. This research will also contribute long-term baseline data enabling broader understanding of marine ecological dynamics in the Arctic. Results of the study will be incorporated into National Park Service public media and curriculum that is shared with northwest Alaska schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunter-gatherers generally focus on capturing resources that provide the highest energy return compared to energy expended. The diet of northwest Alaskan peoples has varied over the past two millennia, but it is unclear if these shifts are in any way linked to the health of marine mammals, on which contemporary communities rely. It is expected that variations in marine mammal health, brought about by changes in the marine environment, should drive these shifts. To evaluate this claim, the co-PI will identify and tally animal remains to asses changes in human diet over the study period. The marine environment will be reconstructed by measuring isotopes of carbon and nitrogen present in archaeological marine mammal bones throughout the same period. The analysis is complemented by an existing radiocarbon chronology that will be augmented where needed to ensure tight control over the ages of analyzed samples. By comparing the timing of changes in human dietary preference to changes in the marine environment, this study will assess the influence of marine health on the diets of coastal Alaskans.

Reference grammars constitute a more comprehensive, highly detailed set of explanations and involve extensive linguistic analysis, so often the initial preliminary attempts at describing a language's patterns result in a short description known as a ""sketch,"" with a later publication of a reference grammar following subsequent scientific research.  In some cases, linguists develop the sketch but never circle back to publish that reference grammar, creating a large gap in the documentation.  This is the case for numerous languages that were described and analyzed in the first half of the twentieth century, including Potawatomi (also called Bod闁肩厧宸癮dmimwen or Bodw闁肩厧宸癮dmimwen), a critically endangered Algonquian language. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. It is estimated that there are less than 10 fluent native speakers of Potawatomi today, all elderly. Considerable effort is being made towards language revitalization, but materials for training advanced speakers are in short supply.

Linguists know that there are a wide variety of outcomes that occur in these situations. For example, sometimes only a few words are borrowed, or perhaps entirely new languages emerge, or speakers use both languages and switch and mix between them in systematic, patterned ways.  There are significant gaps in existing knowledge about language contact situations, and those gaps are even larger when considering contact situations involving two or more endangered languages.  Endangered language contact raises questions on language 'vitality,' that is, who, how and where the languages are in use. Even more understudied is child language acquisition in such contact situations.  This project will document the language usage by children and adults in a region where endangered languages are in contact.

Although documentation projects have been carried out on several Mayan languages, their interaction under contact has not been studied extensively. Understanding the principles of contact-induced change will allow language scientists to better document these languages and to make suggestions concerning their maintenance. The team will focus on Awakateko and K'iche', two endangered Mayan languages from the Huehuetenango region of western Guatemala. This project will investigate the following main questions: How do children acquiring one or both of these languages use them, and what determines which language is more dominant? What are the patterns of everyday use of Awakateko and K'iche' by adult speakers in this area? What factors determine the relative importance of one of the languages?

So while English is often thought of as having subjects and objects that work with verbs to create sentences, linguists have shown a much larger range of ways that subjects behave, especially in terms of their relationships to the verb and the roles they play in sentences.  For example, some subjects are the agent of the action, such as ""She saw the cat,"" others are patients of the action, as in ""The ball was thrown by the boy,"" and some subjects are empty placeholders, such as the ""it"" in ""It is important that you study math.""  Languages show a wide variety of approaches for how these subject roles and object roles pattern, and some of these patterns are quite rare.  Documenting and analyzing these kinds of patterns, which linguists call ""alignment"", is important for a larger understanding of the cross-linguistic variation in human grammar.  This dissertation will add deeper insight to the less frequent type of patterns (""typology"").&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this dissertation project, doctoral student Adam Roth Singerman will document the grammar of Tupari, an endangered language spoken by perhaps 300 people in villages in the Rio Branco Indigenous Reserve, in the Brazilian state of Rond濞戞柨娼眎a.

This theory-neutral description of the language's morphosyntax will serve as the basis for the first complete reference grammar of the language. It will also create a foundation for more detailed, theoretical investigation into several key topics, focusing especially on the grammatical alignment patterns (both ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative) which Tupari shows.  Alignment in Tupari behaves in ways that defy previous generalizations from the literature, so studying it in greater depth is important for typological research and for syntactic theory.  In addition to creating a comprehensive, complete description of Tupari grammar, Singerman will also collaborate with the community to develop native literacy materials.

While it is clear that women are increasingly represented in these formal registries and producer groups, it is less certain that this trend is correlated with women's increased access to secure land holdings, credit, and agricultural services; heightened participation in local governance; or increased economic decision-making power at home. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, if women and men had access to the same resources, agricultural yields could increase 20-30%. In addition, many environmental conservation and global climate change mitigation programs are based upon the idea that farmers will undertake activities such as planting trees or protecting endangered species, yet relatively few studies have assessed whether and how women farmers will respond to these environmental initiatives. The expanding number of women farmers across the globe will certainly have far-reaching implications for policies related to both poverty alleviation and environmental management. Given the importance of stable agricultural livelihoods to North American issues such as migration, food security, environmental conservation, and drug enforcement, a better understanding of women and agriculture is in our vital interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sarah Lyon and Dr. Tad Mutersbaugh of the University of Kentucky explore whether activities associated with EQ-GVCs (ethical quality global value chains) correlate with measures of gender equity.

Oaxaca is also marked by extensive cultural and organizational heterogeneity. The project explores two questions: First, it assesses how this increase affects gender equity in local governance and whether it increases women's land holdings and their access to credit and agricultural training. Second, it examines how women farm, asking whether women have different practices and expectations in comparison with men. To answer these questions, researchers will survey coffee plots; interview both women and men farmers; and observe and participate in activities related to coffee production, producer organizations, and community life. Researchers will also interview coffee buyers, donors, and coffee industry participants in order to better understand the links between gendered production practices and larger market transformations. The research will help identify barriers to women's participation in agriculture with the goal of informing future policies and programs to promote gender equity and women's access to productive resources.

One way in which past environments are inferred is through the analysis of fossilized animal remains, with mammals featuring prominently. In many studies, recovered cranial and dental remains are analyzed in order to reconstruct past faunal communities from which past environmental conditions are then inferred. An alternate method involves analyses of postcranial (e.g. femora and humeri) elements within an ecological functional framework linking skeletal morphology to locomotory patterns and habitat use. While studies of craniodental remains from smaller mammals, such as rodents, have contributed to understanding of the past, analyses of their postcrania have lagged behind those of other groups, such as African antelopes. As rodents are the most abundant and ecologically diverse group of modern mammals, this project will address this issue and test whether this currently underutilized source of data can be used to reconstruct past environments. By generating an accessible comparative database, the results from this study will be applicable to not only reconstructions of paleoenvironments occupied by early human ancestors, but also archaeological studies and can be adapted for modern small mammal biodiversity surveys and habitat monitoring. This study will also provide public science outreach through presentations in both the U.S. and Africa. These presentations will build upon current collaborations with various institutions and contribute to undergraduate, graduate, and public understating of the natural history of the region. Finally, this project provides graduate training for the Co-PI and undergraduate training through the enrollment of students in Department of Anthropology's Graduate-Undergraduate Mentorship Program at Texas A&amp;M University.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing several different methods, this study tests whether analyses of African rodent postcrania can provide useful data for reconstructing past environments. First, using both traditional linear measurements and two-dimensional outlines from digital photographs, this study tests if modern rodent postcrania can be used to identify what taxa (i.e. genus and species) are present, and thus can be used in a similar manner as craniodental remains to reconstruct rodent community composition. Second, traditional linear measurements will also be utilized to test if modern rodent postcrania can be used to assess locomotory patterns within an ecological functional framework to infer habitat use. The correspondence in environmental signals obtained between these two approaches (taxonomic and ecological functional) will then be assessed. After compiling a modern comparative dataset, fossilized rodent postcrania from the South African hominin-bearing sites of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans will be subjected to a dual taxonomic and ecological functional based analysis in order to test previously proposed paleoenvironmental signals that have used other proxy data, including rodent craniodental remains. This study will improve our ability to reconstruct past environments associated with early hominin remains through analyses of a currently underutilized source of data, rodent postcrania, and will help clarify the environmental context at two sites important to our understanding of human evolution.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wInLF44AAAAJ,"['paleoanthropology', 'paleontology', 'taphonomy', 'zooarchaeology']",8413,50,27,30,89,139,189,194,279,277,400,520,403,449,709,711,724,689,585,,,26,714,528,474,57

Yet, separate from these elements is a melodic level called word prosody. By changing pitch and emphasizing certain parts of a word, we can convey the word's meaning and even the broader significance of a phrase. In approximately 50% of the world's languages, changes in pitch on a single syllable can change a word's meaning. Such languages are called tone languages. The most commonly-spoken language in the world, Chinese, is a tone language, as are most of the languages of East and Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southern Mexico. Yet despite decades of research on the building blocks of language, consonants and vowels, we understand little of how humans perceive tone and how tone is integrated into the larger grammatical systems that we use to communicate in everyday life. For instance, Just how is tone processed in the brain? What do speakers produce and listeners tune their ears towards when producing tones rapidly in conversation? How do the deeper grammatical processes affecting tone influence such things?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to bring together experts from diverse perspectives who focus on tone languages. While linguists have explored the diverse ways in which tone interacts with grammar and meaning, they have paid less attention to its role in cognition. On the other hand, psychologists have focused mainly on the neural and behavioral processing of tone, but have not explored tonal detail nor its interaction with grammar. Furthermore, most of the cognitive research on tone focuses on just a handful of East Asian languages. Yet, tonal systems vary substantially across the world's languages and the research should reflect this diversity. Finally, computational work on tone languages has the potential to promote cross-collaboration among researchers, but such work is still in its infancy. The 5th Symposium on the Tonal Aspects of Languages will focus specifically on integrating different academic approaches to the study of tone, promoting the study of diverse tone languages, and modeling tonal behavior using computational methods.

People around the globe spend increasing amounts of time online, sometimes in alternative ""virtual worlds"" where they learn a common culture and come to share beliefs and practices. Online communities may become so important to participants that they eclipse offline social commitments. The researchers wish to investigate the possibility that such ""internet addiction,"" characterized by excessive or poorly controlled behaviors, preoccupations, and urges regarding computer use and internet access, leads to psychological distress or impairment and that this is discernible not only in behavior but also in the genome. Previous scientific research on internet addiction has focused on human neurobiology, giving little attention to sociocultural and environmental factors. In contrast, the present research will combine cross-cultural anthropological methods with methods from functional genomics to examine whether cultural learning and social involvement (in virtual worlds or elsewhere) can reach deep down to shape fundamental health processes. Findings from this research will complement neurobiological approaches and contribute critical information to public debates about addictive behaviors, a pressing public health and social problem.<br/><br/>The researchers will combine cultural consonance, social network, and functional genomic analyses to examine how online environments become embodied in the minds and bodies of internet users. They will focus on young adults (18-32 years of age), a group known to be active virtual world participants and susceptible to addictive behaviors. In the first phase of the study, researchers will collect dried blood spot data to assess whether intensive internet use, as measured by responses to an earlier online survey, is associated with altered functional genomes, and if their gene expression profiles mirror profiles of other psycho-socially distressed populations. The blood spots will be analyzed via microarrays of RNA up/down transcription regulation in leukocytes. This will provide insight into the biological reality of internet-related stress and addiction processes previously documented culturally and psychologically via ethnographic methods and informant self-reports. In the second phase, the researchers will expand the context of this investigation to Brazil and India to explore whether culture-specific offline norms and practices might shape problem internet use patterns in ways that impact individual users' mental and physical health. Together, these two phases will combine to produce a radically interdisciplinary, innovative, and potentially transformative approach to understanding the appeal and effects of online virtual worlds, problematic internet use, and health differences. The research will produce a deeper understanding of how sociocultural and biological processes combine in these technological contexts to shape human health and well-being.

All Native American languages are endangered, although they vary considerably in terms of 'vitality,' that is, who, how and where the languages are in use. Currently, there is no systematic assessment of the Native American languages of the United States and their vitality. Through a workshop followed by a summer course, this project will review existing assessment tools and survey methodologies with the goal of enabling participants to create new and innovative assessment tools that address this need.  Participants will Native Americans who are currently engaged in language work, as citizen scientists, educators, and staff and students at tribal colleges and universities.

In the summer course, participants will learn best practices in data collection, management and archiving, as well as how to deploy assessment data. Participants will come from eight Arizona tribal language and four tribal colleges and universities, the latter of whose involvement will test the viability of the national network of tribal colleges for future assessments. The NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUP) program in EHR is providing support for tribal college participation in this project. Assessing language vitality and the collection and analysis of data in language surveys are the empirical cornerstones for language documentation and revitalization projects in Native American communities.

This research project will build on what is understood of agricultural origins by expanding knowledge of food production's implementation in marginal zones beyond sedentary villages. The project data will contribute to a broader effort to understand how ancient human groups created the conditions in which agriculture became the dominant, and eventually exclusive, economic practice across many regions of the world. By setting this particular research in this broader context of human niche construction, the place of pastoralists in the world, both contemporary and past, is reframed. Instead of overexploitation narratives (which characterize much contemporary development literature), pastoralist landscape development and management are viewed as potential innovations and adaptations to new environs which were previously unsuitable to significant population levels. To understand the relationship between food production and local climate on a global scale, pastoralists and their evolutionary landscapes require careful consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI Abigail Buffington will examine the relationship between the anthropogenic activities of landscape management and the ecology of the broader region of Wadi Sana in the Hadramawt state of southeastern Yemen. This region is today effectively closed to new research projects due to political instability but likely was a significant conduit between regions in prehistory. Domestics from the Levant, South Asia and East Africa eventually became foundational foods in the later agricultural economies of the region. The earliest animal domesticates in Southern Arabia have been recovered from these contexts, as well as evidence of a locally, emergent pastoral economy and very early experiments in vegetation burning and water management. The climatic history of the region provided a beneficial preservation of the sediments in which dating of these discrete phases can be determined. Phytolith assemblages - the microscopic silica deposits that accumulate when plants decay - extracted from these sediments, will be used as signatures of the local plant ecology associated with these niche constructing activities.

Researchers will study through computer and mathematical modeling integrated with archaeological data how early modern humans moved around the landscape, organized their technology, and made choices of raw materials for stone tool manufacture when they faced major climatic and environmental change during formative periods of evolution. Past scholarship on these relationships has relied on informal (qualitative) models. In this research raw materials are considered either to be specifically and directly selected for a certain quality, or raw materials are opportunistically selected when encountered on the landscape, using formal logic-grounded modelling that allows for pin-pointing why a model is wrong or not. In the social sciences, there is growth in the development of formal modeling of human behavior and social and cultural systems. All models must begin simply, and this research, through its use of two simple models, will illustrate how formal models can be applied to questions of technological change and the procurement of materials and thus contribute to that ongoing development of social science modeling. The researchers will seek out and work with undergraduates at Arizona State University (ASU) to assist in expanding the models thus contributing to STEM-based education in the social science. On completion, the models will be used a teaching experience for undergraduate students at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, South Africa and ASU. Additionally, the model framework that will be produced by the researchers can be applied to other examples of tool resource choice regardless of raw material type in archaeological sequences throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will examine the role and importance of stone tool raw materials in the technological organization and mobility strategy of early modern humans when facing major climatic and environmental change during the Middle to Late Pleistocene in the Mossel Bay region on the south coast of South Africa. Using excellent high-resolution climate/environmental and archaeological data from this region, the researchers will contrast two formal models, test different hypotheses drawn from those models and the effects independent variables have on the selection of stone tool raw materials. This endeavor will highlight which raw materials were more time-efficient to use during changing environmental and behavioral contexts, and will provide valuable data on the choices early humans made regarding raw materials that will be integrated into a comprehensive computational model of hunter-gatherer resources that include food resources. Ultimately the researchers will provide needed clarity as to whether the cultural adaptive response to climatic and environmental change during the formative periods of our modern human evolution was driven by a mobility strategy that precluded any specific investment in stone technology and only prioritized moving people to the food resources, or if the response was an increased reliance on technological innovation facilitated by strategic selection of raw materials that demanded technical insight in raw material characteristics.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XQazBcEAAAAJ,"['paleoanthropology', 'modern human origins', 'Africa']",18918,69,259,348,400,474,596,582,681,625,759,787,960,814,1183,1085,1108,1276,1506,169,231,208,1224,1254,1203,104

Researchers have found that the capacity of a system to withstand shocks and uncertainties is a property of a system's overall resilience, not just the resilience of the specific component under stress. Some aspects of a social-ecological system, such as cultural worldviews, are more resistant to change and change more slowly than other aspects, such as rules and norms, which change more quickly. Surprisingly, while systems for allocating resources generally change fastest of all, little is known about how this actually happens and how the changes work their way through the system as a whole to finally affect rules, norms, and worldviews. At a time when resources throughout the world are increasingly under stress from war, population movement, and natural disasters, it is critical for policy makers and citizens, as well as scientists, to understand the social processes through which resource reallocation is achieved when a social-ecological system is under stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, anthropologist Dr. Jerry Jacka (University of Colorado, Boulder) will return to the highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where he has been investigating the relationships between resilience and vulnerability since 1998. The highland social-ecological system is currently under stress because of an El Ni閻㈩垳閮?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. ENSOs, which are caused by variations in the surface temperature of the waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, happen irregularly but when they do, the effects can be devastating. Horticulturalists in highlands PNG are severely impacted during strong El Ni閻㈩垳閮竤 because the accompanying frosts and droughts devastate their subsistence food crops. During previous ENSO weather events, highland people migrated to lower altitude areas, where they could find temporary accommodation with lowland residents. However, economic development, population pressures, and changes in the governance of and access to natural resources are restricting these traditional responses. This affords the researcher an opportunity to observe the processes by which new responses are developed. Data will be gathered through ethnographic fieldwork. Local resource managers from four communities (two migrating communities and two host communities who take the migrants in) will be interviewed to understand the decisions and practices related to mitigating vulnerabilities to ENSO events.

Alone of all animals, humans can tell one another their thoughts and pass along proposals, instructions, warnings, and other ideas. Despite great scientific and technological advances in understanding formal properties of language such as grammar, relatively little is known about how language conveys thought. One major reason is that in order to explain how language conveys thought, we need to understand the structure of thought itself. The structure of thought is not well understood, particularly when it comes to thoughts about events (building a house, eating dinner, etc.).  As a result, our understanding of how language conveys events is particularly poor. Without this missing piece, our understanding of human nature is incomplete and our language technology is limited. One difficulty in accounting for how humans use language to describe and discuss events is that--in addition to the fact that events are highly abstract and thus difficult to study--work on event representations is scattered across different scientific fields with different theoretical underpinnings, methods, and terminologies. This workshop has been organized to bridge these differences by bringing together leading researchers to share recent advances, assess the state of the research, build ties between research fields, and plot a way forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-day workshop will consist of two invited presentations, seven juried talks, a poster session with approximately 20 posters, and a closing discussion.

Yet, despite these efforts, the management of traditional cultural properties - places of special significance to indigenous groups - on public lands remains a contentious issue. Contemporary collaborations between anthropologists and Native American communities have demonstrated that the importance of particular locations extends far beyond their economic utility and that, over time, a given place may be important to multiple groups and for many different reasons. Drawing on these insights, this doctoral dissertation research project will explore the implications that such an understanding of place has for the dynamics of landscape use in the past through a case study of 14 Adena (c. 500 BC - AD 250) sites located in northeastern Kentucky. The results of this research will contribute to understanding of a poorly understood period in American prehistory as well as enhance the infrastructure for research and education by updating existing museum collections. Results will also have implications for the repatriation process required by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Consequently, this project demonstrates the continuing relevance that archaeological research has for the development of federal policy concerning cultural resources management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explore the dynamics of landscape use in the past, this project focuses on the relationship between the construction of monuments and territorial behavior on the part of their builders - a long-standing paradigm within archaeological research. Rather than inferring territoriality from the spatial distribution of sites, this research takes a novel approach to investigating territorial behavior by evaluating change over time in both (1) how specific monuments were engaged with and (2) who was engaging with them. The former is assessed by investigating the spatial distribution of shared practices as indicated by similarities in mortuary behavior between discrete burial contexts. The latter is assessed by quantifying the relative amounts of biological variability present at multiple spatial scales. This is accomplished by using phenotypic variance as a proxy measure for biological variability and by collecting and analyzing data pertaining to a variety of cranial and dental metric and morphological traits. If monuments served a territorial function, they can be expected to have been embedded within relatively stable social configurations. In other words, they would have been used by the same social group or groups over time, resulting in spatial clustering of both shared practices and biological variability. Alternatively, as work with contemporary indigenous peoples suggests, monuments may have been engaged with by multiple social groups and in multiple ways. In this case, monuments are unlikely to have served a territorial function and, instead, can be expected to have been embedded within a sequence of changing social configurations. This situation would result in the loss of the spatial clustering of shared practices and biological variability that is expected within a territorial scenario. The results of this research will be compared to the expectations given above to provide a nuanced evaluation of past landscape use.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gy6G9tEAAAAJ,"['Archaeology and anthropology', 'religion and social organization', 'mortuary analysis', 'iconography', 'Eastern North America']",909,11,12,22,25,23,62,23,26,30,31,29,30,36,36,39,24,36,51,12,18,16,69,33,20,4

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the physiological impacts of female reproduction for wild female chimpanzees, using non-invasively collected demographic, hormonal, genetic, parasitic, and viral data in two chimpanzee populations. Chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives, provide an important comparative model of female reproductive trade-offs, especially given that human studies are confounded by fertility control, infant supplementation, medical care, and childcare assistance. The information generated by this research will help to inform the basic biology underlying women's health.

In modern populations, this linkage between fetal growth and maternal nutrition may be maladaptive in cases where maternal obesity may negatively affect infant and child outcomes.  This doctoral dissertation project will explore the intergenerational effects of traditional (versus store-bought) food consumption among Alaska Native women and their children residing in Anchorage, Alaska. This population has seen dramatic increases in obesity and related problems in the last 20 to 30 years, and prior research has focused on the direct impacts of store-bought foods and decreased physical activity. Studying the potential intergenerational effects of diet will expand our understanding of how nutrition shapes human physiology.

In primates, there are several examples of closely-related primate species living in overlapping geographic ranges. How do these animals distinguish between members of their own versus other species when looking for mates?  This doctoral dissertation project is an investigation of the role of face patterns and behavioral displays in maintaining reproductive isolation in the guenons, a group of forest monkey species in Africa that exhibit an extraordinary variety of colorful face patterns. Innovative methods will be used to measure and analyze the monkeys' appearance and their behavior related to members of their own species and closely-related species. Computer code and methodological details will be made freely available, and the project will support education and diversity in science through undergraduate training and K-12 science education outreach. The investigators will also be involved in scientific and biodiversity conservation outreach programs at their research site, and the project will foster international collaborations between research and conservation organizations in the USA and Nigeria.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying appropriate mates is potentially challenging for closely-related species with overlapping geographic ranges. One mechanism for preventing matings between different species is the evolution of signals that advertise species membership and that are used in mate choice to maintain reproductive isolation. Previous research has demonstrated that guenons can be classified by species based on images of their faces, and that facial distinctiveness increases with the degree of range overlap. However, the behavioral mechanisms by which a system of facial distinctiveness and associative mate choice might operate remain unclear. In this project, researchers will assess if and how guenons discriminate between species, and how variation in face patterns and behavioral displays influences mating decisions. To answer this question, researchers will: (1) identify regions of guenon faces critically important for species classification using computer vision algorithms; (2) assess guenon visual biases for same versus different species faces using a discrimination task with live guenons; (3) quantify behavioral displays and investigate their relationship with facial morphology using computer vision algorithms; and (4) document the ways in which guenon morphology and behavior are used in the wild using behavioral observations. This research will help to clarify the extent to which guenon face patterns function as signals of species membership, and how guenon morphologies and behaviors interact to influence their mating decisions.

However, it is difficult to determine, for a given time period and location, whether the relatively limited and fragmentary hominin fossils represent one or multiple species. Such is the case for South African fossils attributed to the species Australopithecus africanus. The variability in this assemblage of fossils has been proposed to represent more than one species, but there is little agreement about how to sort the various fossils. Determining species designations for this assemblage is important because it affects interpretations of A. africanus as a direct ancestor of our own genus Homo and therefore our understanding of how and where the genus Homo evolved. By incorporating methods from systematic biology and developing new statistical methods, this research will provide a necessary framework to define hominin fossil species and address diversity in hominin evolution. This project will also support training and mentoring of students, including from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, science outreach to high school students, and scan data that will be made available through Morphosource. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recognition of species in the fossil record is of critical importance to understanding hominin evolution and diversity. A vast literature exists on species concepts, but process-based definitions cannot be easily applied to fossil species. Accordingly, levels of variation within purported hypodigms have typically been used to delineate hominin species, but such approaches rest on the problematic assumption that these parameters are comparable in extinct and extant species. Elsewhere in biology, methods have been developed that use the structure of variance within a sample to detect the presence of discrete species. Despite continued controversy over hominin species delineation, these methods have yet to be employed in anthropology. Australopithecus africanus exemplifies this problem. Resolving its alpha taxonomy is critically important to interpreting human evolution, but it remains a contentious issue. The possibility that A. africanus subsumes two or more species has significant implications for the interpretation of the hominin phylogeny and the evolution of the genus Homo. The goal of this research is to quantitatively model species variation in extant primates and fossil hominins in order to re-evaluate the taxonomic heterogeneity of the A. africanus assemblage. This will be accomplished by using phylogenetic comparative methods to estimate an appropriate null hypothesis model of hominin variability. Data will be collected from 3D surfaces of extant primate and fossil hominin teeth using landmarks, semi-landmarks, and GIS-based approaches. The data from this study will provide a detailed model of hominin variability using both mixture models and matrix correlation analyses.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=i0rnxTwAAAAJ,,15295,67,264,292,438,430,487,487,546,499,654,748,653,718,831,818,720,813,712,215,242,174,796,687,759,86

However, long-term resident populations at high altitudes have unique physiological adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce in this extreme niche. This project will examine epigenetic changes, specifically changes in DNA methylation, to understand how being born and raised at high altitude affects human biology. For many years biological anthropologists have sought to understand the heritable genetic variants that allow survival at high altitudes, and this project is significant in moving from a genetic to an epigenetic focus. Unlike high altitude gene variants that an individual either inherits or not, DNA methylation can change during an individual's lifetime because it undergoes reprogramming during early development and is therefore susceptible to the effects of the environment. Project findings will contribute to our understanding of how early development influences adaptive phenotypes to extreme environments. Identification of epigenetic changes in the hypoxia (low-oxygen) response pathway may also inform future research on the role of hypoxia in cancer etiology, cardiac ischemia, and stroke. The project will also support undergraduate and graduate training in laboratory research methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whole-genome and gene-specific DNA methylation signatures will be measured in one high altitude population from the Andes - the Peruvian Quechua.

This project builds on the investigators' strong foundation of research to understand the genetic changes that contribute to high-altitude adaptation in this same population.

The student co-PI will evaluate the nutritional and mechanical properties of dominant savanna and wetland plants, in addition to commonly eaten and avoided baboon foods, across gradients of seasonal and microhabitat variability. Previous work has shed light on broad habitat and food preferences of early humans, and this project's focus on seasonality and microhabitat will provide important new data to augment past studies.

They will establish sampling transects in different microhabitats (grassland, wetland, scrubland, etc.) and collect dominant tree, forb, herb, grass, and sedge species in each transect (where applicable). Commonly eaten and avoided baboon foods will also be collected within each transect; baboons are a suitable ecological analogue for early humans because of their wide dietary niche and preference for savanna habitats.  A portable mechanical tester will be used on fresh plant material to measure the hardness and toughness of the component parts (root, stem, leaf, etc.) of each sampled species. Once mechanical testing is complete, remaining plant samples will be dried and analyzed for fiber, lignin, fat and oil, protein, and trace metal content.

It uses a comparative design with two populations - rural and urban women - who vary in lifetime reproductive investments and contrast in their physical activity levels. The researchers predict that women's levels of lifetime reproductive investment will be directly associated with their levels of oxidative stress, a marker of cellular damage resulting from aerobic metabolism and a potential indicator of physiological aging. They further predict that rural women, who assume vigorous physical activity over their lifetime, will demonstrate greater rates of physiological senescence relative to urban women - over and above the aging effects of reproduction.

This doctoral dissertation project will use novel imaging and analytical methods to study stress-related dental defects in Virunga mountain gorillas for whom long-term behavioral, health, and climate data are available. The ability to link specific dental defects to specific life events will improve our understanding of the complex interplay among ecological, social, and physiological stressors in both extant great apes and fossil hominins. The project will support student mentoring and training in STEM fields as well as collaborations and conservation efforts at the research site.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teeth are important to studies of health and development because they provide a permanent and detailed record of their absolute chronological growth. Enamel hypoplasias manifest as grooves on the tooth surface when growth is disrupted by stressors such as undernutrition and disease. Hypoplastic defects are usually scored by low-power enamel surface observation, and the boundary between normal and abnormal morphology has never been quantitatively defined in great apes. This project employs quantitative criteria to diagnose defects, and establishes a minimum threshold for determining what is a defect versus what is within the bounds of normal variation. Aims include: (1) determining defect presence quantitatively, and testing for differences in defect prevalence and morphology among mountain gorillas and other great apes; (2) analyzing microanatomical parameters of crown growth to determine which factors influence variation in defect morphology among great apes; and (3) testing correspondence between defect timing and stressful events (e.g. injury, disease, intergroup interactions) in the recorded history of individual mountain gorillas to produce the first data on enamel hypoplasia etiology in wild gorillas. By assessing the relationships between defect morphology, microanatomical parameters of enamel growth, and documented stressors in associated life history records, the proposed research will deepen our understanding of factors that underlie differences in defect expression among great apes, and thus improve our ability to more confidently interpret enamel defects in paleoanthropological contexts.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5EZoN1sAAAAJ,,1578,21,5,7,12,14,11,18,20,40,44,46,49,72,108,97,157,120,156,,,,191,211,173,19

This doctoral dissertation project will use a non-human model to understand neuro-genetic changes that correlate with increased social learning and flexibility of vocal behavior. These data will be compared with human and chimpanzee genomic data to identify potential shared evolutionary mechanisms in the evolution of birdsong and human language. By illuminating the molecular mechanisms of auditory perception that support learning of a more flexible vocal behavior in the model system, the research may shed light on our understanding of normal functionality and disorders of human speech.

Public health experts, policymakers and economists are coming to recognize the implications of wellbeing for society as a whole, as well as individuals, thanks to a growing set of results from cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies, including those noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Increasingly, researchers in several fields have noted a positive correlation between language maintenance and wellbeing in endangered language communities. While the nature of the connection between language and wellbeing remains the subject of much debate, the existence of a connection is not entirely unexpected, given the range of outcomes associated with wellbeing. In addition, languages encode knowledge systems, so language loss represents not only the loss of a communicative system, but also the loss of traditional knowledge systems. Importantly, traditional knowledge systems encode cultural practices related to well-being.  Understanding the connections between language and wellbeing will potentially have implications for public health and policy and beyond, but also for language researchers, since traditional knowledge systems are among the most threatened domains of endangered language. Knowledge of esoteric domains such botanical classification and traditional medicines is forgotten well before basic vocabulary and language structure. Hence, these areas of traditional knowledge are precisely the areas which need to be prioritized by language documenters.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together leading scholars from across the world to explore connections between language and wellbeing as part of the 2017 International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation (ICLDC).

Earlier studies of culture contact, migration, and political expansion have exaggerated the diffusion of cultural practices from a dominant core polity to its peripheral settlements. However, this emphasis on the core overlooks the experiences of local communities in culture contact situations, and the implications these interactions have on identity and everyday life. Dr. Gregory D. Wilson and Christina M. Friberg of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) will conduct archaeological research to evaluate how and why the complex Mississippian society of Cahokia (A.D. 1050-1375) extended its influence over the North American midcontinent and how the process of ""Mississippianization"" unfolded in the Lower Illinois River Valley (LIRV) of west-central Illinois. This research will highlight the complex process of culture contact whereby local peoples do not passively adopt the practices of a more powerful core polity, but engage, or resist engagement, in reference to their own identities. The project will also provide educational opportunities, and hands-on experience in both fieldwork and lab work, to undergraduate students, training them in the practical skills necessary to pursue a career in archaeology. Results will be shared with the scientific community through publication, and with local communities through public talks addressing the prehistory of their hometowns while stressing the importance of context and the scientific method in archaeology, as a means to discourage the widespread practice of looting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cahokia, near modern-day St. Louis, Missouri, was the largest PreColumbian city in North America and its inhabitants spread aspects of Mississippian culture as far north as northwest Wisconsin. However, little is understood about how Cahokians initiated these distant interactions, and how and why local groups participated in them. Settlements in Cahokia's American Bottom region of southwestern Illinois show evidence of direct political and economic ties with the paramount center of Cahokia. Archaeological research farther north has also shown that the inhabitants of frontier settlements selectively adopted certain aspects of a Mississippian way of life, while maintaining a number of their existing traditions. An analysis of craft production and exchange, subsistence patterns, and community organization at the Audrey North Site in the LIRV will add valuable insight to archaeologists' understanding of the Mississippian phenomenon in Cahokia's immediate periphery. The proximity of the LIRV to Cahokia likely facilitated regular interaction between the two regions, enabling certain social, political, and economic interactions with American Bottom groups that did not transpire with more distant groups. Using magnetic gradiometry data as a starting point, excavation should reveal evidence of the production and exchange of economically important Cahokian crafts. Bayesian statistical analysis of Radiocarbon assays will establish a timeline for the Mississippianization process in the LIRV. Finally, additional analysis of everyday practices such as food processing and storage and community organization will shed light on the degree to which local LIRV people incorporated Cahokian practices and/or maintained traditions with reference to their existing understanding of world order.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O9fdGTcAAAAJ,['archaeology'],618,15,5,4,4,6,3,10,19,26,20,13,22,26,37,43,49,56,62,3,6,4,61,76,51,1

Extreme flooding generates considerable erosion and sedimentation and provides an excellent opportunity to study how a severe flood can modify channels and floodplains. The ephemeral data collected soon after the flooding ended will improve basic understanding of sediment transport and deposition dynamics during these large, rare floods as well as their importance in the sedimentary record.  In particular, the duration of stream power above a threshold value will help predict where and how much bank and floodplain erosion will occur and when the rates of change in stream power will coincide with patterns of sedimentation.  Project findings will enhance basic understanding of the magnitude and nature of geomorphic adjustments to large floods.  They will help guide policy makers at city, county, state and federal levels and at local watershed associations, and they will enable research scientists to develop more effective watershed management plans for urban streams.  The project also will guide the development of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering and will build STEM capacity by incorporating undergraduate and graduate students into the research process through their involvement in field-based data collection and analytical procedures.<br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the use of longitudinal variations in unit stream power and stream gradient index (SGI) as potential indicators for reach-scale changes in sediment flux that identify sites that are vulnerable to future flooding.  Using state-of-the-art mapping techniques including global positioning systems (GPS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), the investigators will map and measure channel adjustments to test theories, explain patterns, and develop predictive models of river erosion and sedimentation.  While modern mapping technologies will help identify, locate, and recognize patterns of channel and floodplain change, UAVs will acquire low-altitude aerial imagery, which will be used with ""structure-from-motion"" (SfM) photogrammetric techniques to develop high-resolution, large-scale maps of selected sites. Spatial patterns of erosion and sedimentation measured by these methods will be compared with patterns predicted by analysis of stream power to test theories based on the duration of critical power and spatial changes in stream power.

This project will increase knowledge of the processes through which human engagement in ecosystem restoration promotes beneficial feedbacks within coastal ecosystems.  It will enhance understanding about the specific pathways through which restoration disrupts degraded ecosystems and influences human behavior.  A large number of complementary, integrated datasets will be assembled, allowing the project to provide a system-level assessment of ecosystem services related to coastal restoration.  The project also will explore the potential for changes in human perception and a sense of place to create feedbacks through altered human behavior that impact natural system dynamics.  In addition to its fundamental intellectual merit, the project will yield a diverse set of positive broader impacts.  It will quantify relationships between restoration success and impact within and between human and natural components of coastal ecosystems in order to improve likelihoods that future restorations will effectively reduce human vulnerability and improve ecological function.

The project will focus on two overarching themes: the importance of feedbacks in natural-human systems and the importance of value systems and customary practices that are not adequately captured by knowledge systems alone.  It will provide new insights and information regarding how changes in forest ecosystem structure and function result in new relationships between humans and forest species and services as well as how forest-management practices influence ecosystems.  The project also will advance understanding of the complex reciprocal relationships among values and practices, including traditional knowledge of indigenous people, and decision making by individuals and communities.  Furthermore, the project will enhance understanding of the degree to which individuals and communities hold cultural, spiritual, ethical, and aesthetic values and engage in customary forests practices that are not adequately captured by conventional knowledge systems.  Because the project's participants include the College of the Menominee Nation, the project will provide opportunities for Native American students to have education and training opportunities with respect to both basic research and to the use of innovative technologies, including virtual reality software and devices.  Other education and training opportunities in the conduct of interdisciplinary science will be provided for graduate students and post-doctoral scholars.  The project will promote collaborations among educators, scientists, and managers in the region and will inform ongoing environmental assessment activities focused on indigenous peoples and tribal knowledge.  The project also will contribute to enhanced decision making for environmental change adaptation in tribal communities by providing clear routes by which values and relationships with forests can be embedded within state-of-the-art optimization procedures, and it will assist forest managers and community members in working together to evaluate trade-offs when making decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional knowledge from indigenous cultures is recognized as important in environmental assessments but has not been adequately captured in landscape-level planning.  Forests managed by tribal communities are under threat from increasing insect damage, which is already the most spatially extensive forest disturbance in North America, affecting approximately 20 million hectares of forest per year with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.  Significant changes to forests could adversely impact the forest industries upon which many tribal communities depend and could alter tribal identity.  The investigators will use state-of-the-art visualization and virtual reality experiences about future forest conditions to access a broader range of human values about scenarios of future forest conditions.  These outcomes will be used to model preferences in forest-management activities and determine trade-offs and synergies among economic and other value-based decisions about forest management.  The investigators will employ anthropological, ethical, process-based, and immersive means to explore the complex factors that influence how people and communities make decisions and evaluate trade-offs among diverse objectives when faced with considerable uncertainty.  The investigators will test a set of hypotheses, include the propositions that immersive virtual reality can enhance emotive and cognitive perceptions of environmental changes and that current management activities can be refined through the incorporation of value structures into a robust decision making analysis.  Values and practices will be incorporated into consensus mental models, which will inform information available via immersive virtual reality and ecosystem modeling, and the investigators will enhance a decision support algorithm to assess trade-offs in outcomes.  The immersive virtual reality experiences will include interactive 2-D and 3-D landscape maps, 360-degree depictions of alternative forest structures, and interactive maps through time.  The decision-analytics approach will facilitate analysis of trade-offs across a broad set of sustainability metrics and will help test the performance of alternative strategies under uncertain future conditions.

The project will generate new knowledge about interactions between human and natural systems with respect to the influence of ecological variables on public and private land managers' perspectives as well as the influence of land managers' perspectives on the ecological variables.  Project findings will inform land managers about the best practices for restoration and will provide much-needed feedback to restoration scientists about the degree to which their findings are being used and whether anticipated improvements to plant communities are occurring.

The investigators will undertake this project by expanding on a database they previously assembled based on detailed vegetation surveys and environmental parameters for more than 400 sites along streams in the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  They will seek answers to four sets of questions using these natural-system data and data about human attitudes and behavior gathered through the conduct of online surveys and in-person interviews with land managers for each of the sites:  (1) How does plant community structure change as a consequence of restoration?  (2) What aspects of a land manager's background best explain variability in attitudes toward nature and science?  (3) Do elements of the natural environment predict land manager attitudes about science or nature?  (4) Do the attitudes of land managers toward science and/or nature affect the success of restoration projects?  The impact of restoration activities will be measured with comparisons of vegetation over time within restoration sites as well as comparisons among restoration sites and non-restoration reference sites.  The variability in restoration outcomes will be explored using the human-system data, including information about knowledge sources, perspectives on science and nature, and background information, such as education level and level of authority.

Such chemical analyses are essential pieces of evidence used by archaeologists to investigate the technology, economics, social and political organization, identity, and religious practices in ancient societies. Understanding past human behavior can inform modern efforts to address issues such as population movement, resource exploitation, group interaction, and internal group social stress.  The long-term success of the Archaeometry Laboratory has resulted in an unparalleled database of artifact and raw material chemical compositions that greatly enhance the explanatory power of future analytical studies as well as provide the raw material for large-scale research projects using existing data. The laboratory is able to support a wide variety of projects and numerous students, researchers, and visiting scholars every year, and contributes to knowledge diffusion through close scientific collaborations between MURR staff and outside researchers, student education, and professional publications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MURR Archaeometry Laboratory focuses on elemental and isotopic analysis in order to examine the production, exchange, and movement of a broad variety of artifacts including ceramics, lithics, and metals, using neutron activation analysis (NAA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) including a laser ablation system and a multi-collector. The laboratory also supports geochemical research on the petrogenesis of various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Broader impacts of the Archaeometry Laboratory at MURR include: (1) availability of affordable chemical and isotopic analyses for students and faculty from academic departments in the US; (2) training of undergraduate and graduate students in the selection and use of laboratory methods of analysis; (3) advice in project design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of the chemical and isotopic data; and (4) public access by archaeologists, geologists, and scientists from many disciplines to the compositional database.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B5oiSd0AAAAJ,"['archaeology', 'archaeometry', 'american southwest', 'NAA', 'XRF']",1274,14,,,,,13,14,11,37,35,39,61,71,73,68,99,136,137,,,,127,142,146,12

However, migration and genetic admixture are also drivers of biological change and adaptation. Consequently, characterizing how ancient migrations shape genetic diversity is vital to inform understanding of biological ancestry, cultural evolution, and health outcomes in admixed human populations. But, because modern populations do not retain all the genomic diversity of ancient groups, genetic research with contemporary individuals provides limited resolution for reconstructing ancient demographic events. This limitation can be addressed by combining archaeological questions with ancient DNA. This investigation characterizes the genetic diversity of ancient human groups and test hypotheses about their relationships to other ancient and modern populations. Specifically, ancient DNA obtained from human skeletal remains in three archaeological sites (Tibes, Punta Candelero and Paso del Indio) will be analyzed to investigate the role of migration and genetic admixture in the history of pre-Columbian populations from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. The project incorporates training of undergraduate students in laboratory and analytical methods and contributes to the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences through training of a female, Puerto Rican doctoral student. The researchers will engage the public by disseminating project findings through Ask-A Biologist, an online resource for students, teachers and the public, and by collaborating with archaeologists and the Ceremonial Center of Tibes site museum to integrate findings in public site tours. A significant aspect of this research is the optimization of protocols for DNA recovery from degraded skeletal remains. This methodological development improves ancient DNA recovery from remains in tropical environments, and can be extended to forensic applications where DNA may be damaged due to corpse deposition in adverse preservation contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Debate remains about how many migrants settled the island of Puerto Rico in antiquity, where they came from, and how these processes influenced social interaction networks across the ancient Caribbean basin. This investigation compares ancient mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from skeletal remains dated A.D. 500-1300, with data from other modern and ancient indigenous populations of the Americas to determine: (1) How were ancient populations in Puerto Rico related to continental Native American groups, and what may this indicate about their origins? (2) What was the extent of gene flow in the pre-contact Caribbean, and what may this indicate about local social interaction? Project findings reassess existing models for the peopling of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and explore how migration and admixture shaped the biocultural diversity of ancient Caribbean populations. By also examining the extent of inter-island migration and genetic exchange, this investigation elucidates the role of kinship, residence patterns and mobility in the maintenance of interaction networks across the pre-Columbian Caribbean. Lastly, this study also sheds light on the genetic relationships between pre-Columbian populations and modern Puerto Ricans, the second largest Hispanic group in the USA. Given the growing role that Native American ethnicity plays in contemporary Puerto Rican culture, project results have implications for the construction and experience of modern Puerto Rican identity.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xqKVKIwAAAAJ,"['anthropological genetics', 'evolutionary biology', 'ancient DNA']",10861,44,220,248,283,330,411,355,430,441,474,370,431,503,523,484,491,561,590,234,194,201,716,703,756,59

By some estimates, the increased pollutants being emitted by these vehicles are causing in excess of $100 million in avoidable health care costs and as many as 40-100 extra deaths per year in the U.S. alone. The solution to the problem appears straightforward at first glance: fix the roughly 500,000 vehicles currently on the roads and thus address the environmental and health impacts. The challenge is that those vehicles are owned by private citizens for whom the fix will likely incur significant personal cost, including increased costs of ownership, reduced resale values, degraded vehicle performance and reduced personal enjoyment. Thus, the ""defeat device"" issue is a collective action problem in which many individuals must act independently to resolve the threat to public health and the environment. This project explores the behavioral and psychological responses of these vehicle owners to this unanticipated collective action problem in an effort to answer three key questions. First, what are the key factors that influence individuals' willingness to take action to confront a problem caused by someone else? Second, what are the emotional and behavioral implications for people who are personally affected by an event that challenges their personal and social identities? Third, if people are given an opportunity to publicly let others know that they are taking action, does that promote behavior change and affect their emotional well-being?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, the research team will reach out to owners of the affected vehicles and conduct two surveys across a year. The surveys will examine owners' reactions and responses to the issue, including their decisions about whether and when to have their vehicles repaired. In addition, the project explores how people's intentions might change if a behavior that is otherwise invisible-- whether one's car has been repaired or still polluting--could become visible, by providing some ""signal"" to other drivers such as a car sticker.  By examining these psychological processes this project may produce practical insights about human decision-making that could be used to address this and future collective action problems. Knowledge gained by this longitudinal study will shed light on how people make decisions that carry personal costs but also produce societal benefits, and possibly lead to the development of more effective strategies to help support people in making decisions that are beneficial both for themselves and for society.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2pG6OlIAAAAJ,"['environmental decision-making', 'communication', 'public engagement with science']",6457,32,,,,,,,,,32,61,169,228,273,368,470,605,758,,,,1041,999,1185,138

However, this vast record of archaeological data currently remains fragmented in a variety of incompatible formats and database structures scattered across largely inaccessible public and private data stores. The DINAA (Digital Index of North American Archaeology) project will obtain, index, and integrate nonsensitive aspects of this record in coordination with state, tribal, and federal personnel from across the country. The effort is led by  David G. Anderson of the University of Tennessee, Eric C. Kansa of Open Context, Dr. Sarah Whitcher Kansa of the Alexandria Archive Institute, and Dr. Joshua Wells of Indiana University South Bend. The resulting databases and maps have a low spatial resolution to protect site integrity, but will otherwise permit, for the first time, the visualization and exploration of human responses to change in the natural and social environment at a continental scale over the entire period of human settlement in North America. By removing access, legal and technical barriers, this project will offer researchers, land managers, and the public truly ""Open Data"" to facilitate interdisciplinary research, powerful new approaches to computational modeling, data intensive instruction, and archaeological resource management at local, regional and national scales. The ready availability of online maps, datasets, and links to an ecosystem of similar products and analysis tools will enhance public awareness, use, and appreciation for scientific research in general and archaeology in particular. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DINAA project addresses head-on a major challenge facing archaeological informatics: how to connect currently incompatible and fragmentary legacy information systems together so our community can engage in cutting-edge science.

However human societies have not always been territorial and many questions remain as to the timing and conditions under which territoriality emerges. It is only through the discipline of archaeology can social scientists evaluate the emergence of and changes in territoriality across thousands of years.  Anthropologists have theorized that territoriality emerges as a trade-off between benefits and risks of defending land using the Economic Defensibility Model (EDM). The EDM will be evaluated through the study of archaeological materials from the Texas Coastal Plain using geochemical methods. This project involves collaboration with The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This research contributes to the training of a minority graduate student in archaeological and geochemical methods. It will also contribute to a publicly available geochemical dataset that will be useful to multiple disciplines, including geology, ecology as well as archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EDM considers resource density, territory size, and modes of defense to posit the conditions under which territoriality emerges. While this model has been effective in understanding ethnographic examples of different types of territoriality, it has yet to be systematically evaluated in archaeological contexts. This project addresses this gap by examining territoriality during the Late Archaic period (2000 BC-AD 800) on the Texas Coastal Plain (TCP). The Late Archaic was a period of climatic amelioration and during this point in time population density peaked as hunter-gatherers made use of freshwater resources, white-tail deer, pecans, and tubers.  They returned to central locations for rituals and to bury their dead however, the scale of their population movements is unknown. Researchers argue that as hunter-gatherer populations on the TCP increased, there was a decline in mobility that may have led to increasing territoriality. The investigators will utilize strontium (87Sr/86Sr) stable isotope analysis to evaluate the presence of territoriality.  As an ecological tracer, 87Sr/86Sr levels in human bone can potentially tie individuals to particular locations and therefore allow inferences regarding territoriality. The 87Sr/86Sr of tooth enamel of over 50 individuals from the archaeological site of Loma Sandia will be measured.  In addition, the bioavailability of 87Sr/86Sr from seven geologic regions in the TCP will be evaluated through examination of modern faunal samples. These datasets will be analyzed to evaluate the degree that humans are tied to particular locations.

This research will focus on the Classic Maya polity of La Corona, located in northern Guatemala. This archaeological project will study the elusive topic of the administrative and economic behaviors which supported the political activities of a royal court for centuries. This project departs from others which have emphasized priestly kings and divine kingship as the focus of Classic Maya political activities because it focusses on the practical dimensions of power. The study of the everyday practicalities of ruling in Classic Maya society will help develop a more pragmatic model for the roles of both the elite and non-elite in the operation of an ancient political institution. While the Classic Maya were unique in many ways, their political institutions were functionally similar to that of other ancient complex societies. Thus, this project's approach is replicable and therefore should positively impact the broader field of anthropological archaeology. Moreover, by broadening our analytical scope, the study of ancient non-western political systems should shed light on studies of modern-day political and economic systems many of which derive from and incorporate such traditional elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Marcello Canuto, Maxime Lamoureux-St-Hilaire, and their research team will study key administrative buildings as well as the floors and refuse-disposal areas associated with the support-oriented section of the La Corona regal palace. Beyond traditional archaeological methods, this research project will employ proven interdisciplinary methods in order to reconstruct the economic behaviors of this ancient institution. Geochemical analyses will study trace-elements absorbed in the plastered floors of the palace, while soil flotation will be used to recover micro-artifacts embedded in those same floors, along with botanical remains recovered from refuse-disposal areas produced by this ancient royal court. These different techniques have only been recently applied jointly to study ancient architecture. The data produced by these interdisciplinary techniques are unique in that they will document several subtle markers of ancient behaviors which would not normally be recoverable by traditional archaeological techniques. The development of this innovative methodology to study the practical aspects of ancient political institutions may positively impact the broader field of anthropological archaeology. This project is part of the larger La Corona Regional Archaeological Project (PRALC), which operates in the northwest Pet闁肩厧宕?Region of Guatemala; one of the most under-studied regions of the Maya world.

Jackson Njau of the Indiana University, Bloomington and Lindsay McHenry of University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, along with colleagues from the US, Europe, and Tanzania, seek to understand the relationships between Earth system history and human (""hominin"") evolution by investigating the environmental contexts in which early ancestors of humans evolved. Previous researchers have postulated that climate-driven environmental changes on the African continent strongly influenced such evolution over the last several million years. Whether (and how) humans and other species adapt to changing climate is a scientific subject that has captivated public interest. Archaeology is well placed to link climate and environmental history to hominin records by integrating paleoenvironmental datasets archived in the sediments of ancient lakes near paleoanthropological sites. In addition to generating new scientific data, this project will open new interdisciplinary research frontiers across the earth sciences and anthropology that will impact the scientific debates on human origins research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will investigate how and when climate and environmental forces influenced adaptation during the critical times of human evolution. Do changes in morphology, innovation, sociality, and behavioral traits reflect changes in the local ecology, such as habitat, food, predation pressure, and the availability of resources on the landscape? These questions will be addressed by linking the detailed paleoclimatic record recovered from drilled sediment cores to excavated archeological sites. Four recently acquired cores from the ancient lake at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, covering over 2 million years of sedimentation, will be compared to key nearby archeological layers that document records of evolving hominin species and changes in stone tool technologies. Lake sediments archive climate history through time, therefore providing an unprecedented paleoclimatic record of the paleoanthropological material from the prehistoric Olduvai lake basin. These paleoenvironmental data will inform models of hominin land use behaviors and elucidate how climatic change drove hominin adaptations in morphology and cultural behaviors that allowed them to better adapt to variable environmental conditions. Using the composition of volcanic ash layers and detailed examination of the sedimentary units preserved in both cores and outcrops, the team will examine whether times of significant environmental change (as determined in the cores) correspond to times of significant cultural or biological change (in the outcrops and excavations).

Language typology is the field of scientific study that investigates how languages are similar to and different from each other. Previous work has produced much information about how languages differ, but no clear consensus about why. Why do some languages tend to use simple, individual words to convey each bit of meaning? Why do other languages build complex words that are equivalent to entire sentences? (English is somewhere in the middle.) And especially, why do languages differ so significantly in this way, when all humans are born with the same mental 'tools' for producing, understanding and learning language? The relationship between language diversity globally and the individual speaker's mental 'toolbox' is particularly important. Research in this area is foundational to the following goals: (i) developing expert speakers of foreign languages that are important to the national interest; (ii) improving adults' ability in general to acquire languages successfully; and (iii) creating tools and resources (e.g. automatic computer translations) for under-resourced languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant funds a two-day conference that will connect language diversity to the mental tools that individual speakers have for producing, understanding and learning language. Do the ways that people mentally organize and process language lead to the similarities and differences that are observed across languages? If so, how? The conference will advance understanding of how languages differ, evaluate hypotheses about the reasons for similarities and differences, and identify new paths for investigation. The conference will bring together researchers who work in different areas--language diversity, how words are stored and organized in the human mind, and computational methods for modeling language structure. By bringing together researchers with different expertise, this conference will offer new ways to think about language diversity and its relationship to the individual. It will also play an important role in training a new generation of scholars.

Jack Broughton and Joan Coltrain, of the University of Utah, will undertake research to study how variation in the intensity and frequency of El Ni閻㈩垳閮?events in northern Baja California, Mexico over the past 11,000 years influenced marine and terrestrial fish, birds, and mammals. Their research will also investigate how past peoples responded to changes in the availability of different animal resources. This research will provide novel data sets from which to anticipate change in future animal populations under a range of forecasted El Ni閻㈩垳閮?related variation scenarios and thus support current and future management of marine and terrestrial animals of the eastern Pacific. The project will also reveal how human populations responded to past El Ni閻㈩垳閮?and provide insight into the impact of future El Ni閻㈩垳閮?events on coastal societies in developing countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the impacts of ancient El Ni閻㈩垳閮?events on past human societies and animals have been documented in specific isolated cases, continuous, high-resolution, millennial-scale records of the impact of El Ni閻㈩垳閮?variation on animal resources and the resulting changes in the human use of North American landscapes have yet to be documented. This project will generate just such a record from a massive collection of animal bones and artifacts that was deposited over the past 11,000 years by people and raptors (hawks, eagles, owls) that occupied a rock shelter site (Abrigo de los Escorpiones) located about 100 m from the Pacific coast of northern Baja California, Mexico. The currently archived animal bone collection includes both marine and terrestrial species and represents one of the largest, well-stratified, continuous, records of climate-based changes in animal populations on the Pacific coast of North America. A rich record of artifacts and features (e.g., fire hearths, marine shell layers) attest to a substantial but intermittent human use of the shelter. The project will determine whether people abandoned the coastal site during periods with high El Ni閻㈩垳閮?frequencies. Such times are characterized by both warm sea-surface temperatures that disrupt marine ecosystems and increased precipitation that enhances the productivity of inland habitats. The study will involve: (1) identification of the animal bones to the species level, (2) radiocarbon dating of a large sample of the bones to establish a time-line and chronology for the deposits, (3) establishing a record of human occupational intensity of the site through artifact counts and evidence of human-caused damage on animal bones (e.g., stone tool cut marks, burning), (4) stable isotope analysis of both bones and shells to provide information on El Ni閻㈩垳閮?variation over the past 11,000 years, and (5) statistical analysis to determine correlations between variation in past El Ni閻㈩垳閮?and change in local animal and human populations.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=h_fi3WwAAAAJ,"['Zooarchaeology', 'paleozoology', 'behavioral ecology', 'archaeology', 'taphonomy']",4260,30,120,129,110,130,176,224,155,167,231,204,222,233,320,207,194,201,201,60,71,68,247,179,212,17

Imitation of others' speech has been observed between speakers who speak the same dialect and also between speakers who speak different dialects. Previous studies have found that adult speakers who move to a new speech community can partially acquire the accent of the new community. What is less understood, however, is the mechanisms that facilitate or constrain long-term imitation of second-dialect properties. The goal of the current project is to explore the linguistic, situational, and cognitive factors that influence the degree to which imitation of linguistic properties of another dialect is maintained beyond exposure and generalizes to novel words. <br/><br/>This project will focus on the imitation of dialect-specific properties across two Mandarin regional varieties spoken in Jianshi and Laifeng counties, China. The first experiment will investigate how imitation generalizes to novel monosyllabic words, to reveal the mental representations underlying word processing in Mandarin, i.e., syllables, tones, consonants, vowels, or subsegmental features. The second experiment will examine how the number of token repetitions and lexical contexts containing the variant affect the degree of imitation maintenance and generalization, to reveal the relative contributions of exposure amount and variability to long-term phonetic imitation. The third experiment will use different instructions during post-exposure reading as a way of influencing participants' conscious effort, to investigate the role of automaticity in mediating imitation maintenance and generalization. <br/><br/>The results of this project will reveal the mechanisms underlying cross-dialect imitation that enable or constrain speakers to maintain and generalize imitation after various exposure environments and in response to different requirements. The results will also provide new insights into the automatic and controlled aspects of imitation, and the representational units connecting speech perception and production.

At the same time, the extraction of energy resources such as natural gas can paradoxically promote violence and lead to environmental disasters that halt the economic development they were designed to achieve. This project uses cultural anthropology fieldwork to explore the linkages between official efforts to control violence and nature, how energy projects and power relate to peace. The data and findings from this research will aid governments and businesses pursuing energy development projects, and the civil society organizations and academics working with them, to better understand their meanings and effects.

Over the past decade, while rebuilding the country in the wake of the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government has developed contracts to build industrial-scale gas-fueled power projects to extract methane from Lake Kivu. The methane extraction project has two stated aims: first, to reduce dangerous levels of unstable gasses dissolved in the lake and thus prevent it from an unpredictable, and deadly, explosion; and second, to provide much-needed power to fuel development for the region and country. The PI, who has conducted research in Rwanda since 2002, will conduct to study how people living alongside the lake experience the transformations brought about by the gas extraction project. Working closely with the Rwandan Lake Kivu Monitoring Program, the PI will collect data through participant observation, interviews, life histories, and document analysis.

Bilinguals alternate between stretches of speech in the different languages even when speaking on the same topic to the same interlocutor. Beyond merely inserting isolated words from another language, such code-switching may involve juxtaposing entire phrases from different languages in the same speech event. Educators, journalists, and other public figures often disparage code-switching as haphazard mixing, yet it is now known that those who code-switch are in fact the most highly skilled bilinguals. What is still a conundrum are the rules governing code-switching. This project will integrate research and education by training students to analyze natural bilingual speech. The project will promote international inter-university collaborations, and by revealing the systematic patterning of bilingual speech, the results will help counteract the disparagement of what is often labeled Spanglish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Mexico Spanish-English Bilingual speech corpus, constructed with prior NSF support, provides an appropriate database for the scientific investigation of code-switching because it contains copious instances produced during spontaneous bilingual conversations. The transcribed recordings will be comprehensively tagged for language and, based on this infrastructure, systematic quantitative analyses will be carried out to address two kinds of questions. One is the linguistic conditions on code-switching: At which syntactic and prosodic points in the speech stream do bilinguals prefer to code-switch? The other is the cognitive processes involved: Do contextual elements, such as cognate words and interlocutor language choice, act as triggers? By counting both instances of the presence and absence of code-switching, the researchers will be able to distinguish idiosyncratic tokens from community norms and rare occurrences from major patterns, estimate the propensity of code-switching at particular sites, and evaluate the actual role and scope of contextual elements that have been hypothesized to constrain patterns of code-switching.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fv17gMYAAAAJ,['linguistics'],3711,35,16,23,19,34,45,75,96,123,193,150,203,245,290,234,302,208,318,,13,9,373,261,336,12

This combined UAV/remote sensing system makes possible rapid and accurate capture of environmental data for the creation of 3D models of vegetation, land surfaces, and constructed features. It also provides a platform for testing new robotic and remote sensing technologies. For instance, researchers in fields such as agricultural sciences and engineering technology can use the instrument for precision farming, farm and pasture mapping, and robotics development. Earth and space scientists can use the instrument for testing new sensors and environmental research. Dr. Hare will employ the vehicle to introduce new capabilities to Mesoamerican archaeology. Students will benefit from hands-on experience and development with cutting-edge technologies. This instrument will be the first one of its kind available to the researchers and students at Morehead State University, in Appalachian eastern Kentucky, and in Mesoamerican archaeological research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined heavy-lift UAV/remote sensing system will enhance research and development by leveraging several new technologies. First, the heavy-lift UAV allows for carrying multiple sensors simultaneously at low elevations and slow speeds to capture high-resolution and overlapping image data through most climatic and surface conditions. Second, the global navigation satellite system and inertial measurement unit provide centimeter-level control and georeferencing of data. Third, the high-resolution cameras capture a variety of wavelengths including visible, near infrared, and infrared. Fourth, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) device can scan through vegetation with better than 10 cm accuracy. One example of the instrument's use is Dr. Hare's mapping of archaeological ruins and associated environmental features through the forest canopy for his ongoing archaeological investigations at the ancient city of Mayap閻犲绠?in the northern Yucatan of Mexico. The purpose of archaeological survey in Mexico's northern Yucat閻犲绠?Peninsula is to map the regional context of the ancient political and economic capital of Mayap閻犲绠? Hence, the instrument will be used for archaeological field survey, mapping ancient settlements, and mapping excavations for spatial data analysis. The resulting data will make possible the creation of 3D models of ancient Mayan ruins at the scale of entire regions. Capturing material remains of past people in context is the foundation of all archaeological research, but these activities are hampered by difficult field conditions and the limitations and high costs of traditional mapping technologies.

In a world that has become increasingly linguistically and culturally complex, it is critical to understand what happens when speakers of different languages or linguistic varieties come into contact; to see whether they influence each other or whether linguistic differences are used to maintain social boundaries. Most research on language contact emphasizes the ""mutual influence"" aspects of contact, where the linguistic varieties in contact converge and become more like each other. This study, in contrast, considers a case in which linguistic boundaries have been stable for at least half a millennium, and seeks to discover the linguistic and social reasons why such a boundary persists today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandhya Narayanan, under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Mannheim of the University of Michigan, will explore how linguistic and social boundaries are maintained between speakers of different indigenous languages, by tracking how speakers use these languages, how they are able to recognize and evaluate differences among themselves, and what structural mechanisms perpetuate the boundary between them. This research investigates the case of contact between Quechua and Aymara, two Native South American languages spoken predominantly in Peru and Bolivia. These languages have been in intimate contact since before the Spanish conquest, but have maintained their linguistic distinctiveness through today. The research tests the hypothesis that differences in the rhythmic timing structures of the languages both maintain the linguistic boundary and - linked to behavioral features - permit people to identify each other at a distance as speakers of one or the other language. The project employs a range of ethnographic and linguistic anthropological methods of data collection and analysis including social network analysis, participant observation, interviews, linguistic life history surveys, textual analysis, and morphosyntactic and interaction based analysis.

Boston University has made a major commitment to expand and strengthen neuroscience research, including the construction of a new Integrated Life Sciences and Engineering research building. A new Cognitive Neuroimaging Center and Center for Systems Neuroscience will be located within this new building.  Acquisition of a MRI scanner will provide Boston University neuroscience researchers and students with access to advanced neuroimaging instrumentation. The instrumentation location within Boston University's new multidisciplinary research building will facilitate close collaborations between BU's neuroscience, engineering, and computational faculty and students. The cognitive and systems neuroscience investigators at Boston University share a commitment to training the next generation of scientists, and are focused on increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  The investigators are active in K-12 outreach programs, have developed courses in cognitive neuroscience and brain mapping, actively train undergraduate researchers, contribute to undergraduate and graduate training programs in neuroscience, and work to increase minority representation in STEM areas. The acquisition of a new MRI scanner will broaden resources for research and training at Boston University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the shared goals of Boston University's new Cognitive Neuroimaging Center and the Center for Systems Neuroscience is to increase our understanding of brain function by linking across multiple systems levels.  Development of these research facilities will provide Boston University neuroscience researchers with state-of-the-art facilities as a shared, core facility for research, with the goal of developing an understanding of brain function that bridges across scales - from the cellular level, to the systems level, to the level of human cognition and behavior.  The aim is to gain insight into cognition and behavior in terms of understanding the underlying brain networks, the neural circuits within these brain systems, and the cellular and molecular components of these circuits.  To reach this goal will require multidisciplinary interaction between scientists developing and using cutting-edge research experimental methodologies with advanced computational techniques, including advanced neuroimaging technology.  BU researchers have developed strong collaborations, which bridge the gap from animal to human level research. The Boston University investigators have publications and a proven track record of multidisciplinary collaborations that cut across traditional boundaries and allow for integration of data across levels.  The acquisition of a Siemens 3T MAGNETOM Prisma MRI system and its placement within a multidisciplinary center will foster neuroscience research that does not adhere to the traditional human/animal divide, allowing the development of models that link the understanding of neural circuits to cognition and behavior.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iRFNTTcAAAAJ,"['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Memory', 'Learning', 'Neuroimaging']",12723,53,322,358,442,428,440,488,438,490,511,705,594,696,595,614,654,683,612,229,233,293,674,612,600,53

However, modern technology now makes it possible to use automated means to extract variation in pronunciation from spoken interviews. This research project uses available software to process sixty-four interviews with speakers from Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas recorded from 1968-1983. These interviews constitute a geographic and social sample of speakers across the Gulf States. All of the transcriptions of the interviews, the vowel pronunciation data, and the visualizations will be presented on the website of the Linguistic Atlas Project. Detailed data on actual speaker variation addresses the industrial methods currently used for speech recognition and speech synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be the first large-scale test of the complex systems model against acoustic phonetic data. The legacy interviews consist of over 200 Gb of files containing 372 hours of digital audio interviews. In the first stage of the research, vowel pronunciations will be extracted from a list of seventy-eight different words that were elicitation targets in the interviews, plus additional words found to occur frequently in the interviews such as color terms, up to a total of three hundred words. The resulting data set will have approximately 22,500 vowel tokens per interview, nearly 1,500,000 tokens across the data set, a very large corpus of data on Southern American English. The second stage of the project will create visualizations of these tokens to determine the dimensions of variation in the realization of vowels per speaker, social category, and geographic area. The science of complex systems will be employed as a model in the analysis, which predicts that the wide range of realizations that occurs in the groups under analysis will be self-organized into nonlinear distributional patterns. The extraction and display of the full range of vowel variation has the potential to improve industrial methods used for both speech recognition and speech synthesis, as it offers a detailed view of actual variation for speakers and groups rather than assuming a consistent or ?average? realization of vowels.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gckWFYUAAAAJ,['Quantum complexity theory'],217,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,6,16,,,,24,41,108,16

Researchers can also uncover language patterns that result from properties that systematically vary between spoken and signed languages, such as the high prevalence of iconic forms (words that resemble what they mean) in sign languages. Psychological and linguistic research on spoken languages has relied on lexical databases--repositories of information about the words of a language--to identify factors that influence how words are comprehended and produced, to understand how words are organized and structured in the mind and brain (in our ""mental lexicon""), and to discover the linguistic patterns that are present in languages.

This research will focus on the development and maintenance of social inequality.  Inequality is a defining characteristic of all prehistoric complex societies and and is of contemporary relevance because it characterizes all societies which exist in the world today.  Archaeologists speculate that it first became formalized within and between households, although little is currently known about how households contributed to emergent ideologies and were innovators and creators of that ideology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The objective of this research is to determine how households contributed to social inequality at the Preclassic-period (900 BCE-150 CE) site of Holtun, Guatemala. The investigators central hypothesis is that social inequality developed at Holtun circa 300 BCE, and social complexity circa CE 25, with the support of both emergent elite and commoner households at the site through the medium of communal ritual and the economy associated with it. The central hypothesis will be tested by, 1) identifying and studying the development of social inequality through variation in Middle Preclassic-period (600-300 BCE) household inventories, 2) identifying and studying the differential contribution of households to communal ritual and economic activity through time, and 3) identifying the source and changes in ritual practice and symbols within and between households through time. Principal methods include excavation into domestic and monumental architecture, and analysis of artifacts using both traditional and contemporary approaches including: ceramic and lithic typological classification, petrography, lithic microwear analysis and replication studies, faunal analysis, X-ray Fluorescence, stable-isotope analysis of human bone, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, and soil geo-chemistry studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will promote teaching, training, and learning by employing graduate, undergraduate, and Dallas-area high school students to engage in archaeological research, training, and experimental studies. The research includes underrepresented groups, specifically women in science. While the number of women attaining doctoral degrees in the social sciences has risen, women in archaeology still have not achieved equal employment and representation in the field. The research also incorporates Latino high school students from one of Dallas Counties poorest cities and provides training for an international team including Guatemalan undergraduates. The results of this research will be broadly disseminated to the international community at conferences and meetings.

Yet, the process by which people learn about threatening cues is inexact, often producing excessive fears, disruptive fear responses, and anxiety. Based on the importance that close social ties have for survival, this research examines social support figures as stimuli that promote survival.  Such 'prepared safety stimuli' promote feelings of safety and may reduce threat responses.  This is in contrast to 'prepared fear stimuli' that have historically threatened human survival (e.g., snakes, spiders). Considerable research has focused on prepared fear stimuli, but little prior work has examined prepared safety stimuli. This research will develop an understanding of these unique safety signals and the beneficial role they might play in both preventing people from learning new fears and aiding people in extinguishing old ones. This research will also help to develop a deeper understanding of the role of social support figures as prepared safety stimuli. In addition, this research may illuminate avenues for improving current interventions targeted at reducing maladaptive fears and anxiety, thereby improving well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will bridge the social support and fear learning literatures, employing a combination of fear conditioning, social buffering, and neuroimaging methods. In a series of studies, Dr. Naomi Eisenberger at the University of California, Los Angeles, will define prepared safety stimuli and test whether social support figures fulfill those parameters. The proposed studies will further the examination of social support figures as prepared safety stimuli by examining: 1) whether social support figures, but not other familiar or rewarding stimuli (which are not turned to for social support), serve as prepared safety stimuli, 2) whether ambivalent support figures, who are sources of both positivity (support) and negativity (stress/negative affect), can serve as prepared safety stimuli, 3) whether stimuli historically associated with the presence of social support (warmth, softness) act as prepared safety stimuli, 4) the neural regions that underlie the safety effects of social support figures, and 5) whether support figures inhibit fear learning and enhance fear extinction to other stimuli. Given the prevalence of anxiety and fear-related disorders in the United States, understanding the unique functions of prepared safety stimuli and the role they might play in preventing fear learning or extinguishing learned fears has the potential to pave the way for new interventions targeted at reducing maladaptive fear and anxiety.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lr7BC-QAAAAJ,"['social neuroscience', 'affective neuroscience', 'social psychology', 'affective science', 'emotion']",34913,81,,201,213,335,530,756,909,1348,1488,1857,2070,2421,2497,2491,2673,2652,2830,,,,3016,2870,2765,269

These discrepancies between people's intentions and behavior have been implicated in some of society's most pressing problems, including obesity, substance abuse, discrimination, aggression, and poor financial decision-making. Self-regulation research attempts to understand who, when, and why some succeed--and others fail--in realizing their goals and values in their every day behavior. One important insight from this research is that self-regulation involves a number of distinct challenges that must each be addressed in unique ways. At times, self-regulation requires thinking about circumstances that extend beyond the immediate here-and-now. To illustrate, although students might be tempted to attend a week-night social gathering, it is their ability to think about the distant future rewards of studying that advances their academic goals. At other times, self-regulation requires attention to the details of the present context. Proof-reading for typographical errors, for example, requires students to narrowly focus their attention on the specifics of the task at-hand. The present work aims to test if people have developed unique thinking styles or mindsets that are tuned to help them address each of these two types of challenges--namely, high-level and low-level construal. Critically, the investigator tests the novel prediction that successful regulation requires flexibly matching the right mindset to the right challenge. That is, knowing when to engage in which psychological mindset may be the key reason why some people are able to attain their goals, and others are not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions are explored in six studies. The studies examine people's beliefs about what kinds of thinking will promote their goals under different circumstances. Those beliefs are compared to what research indicates will improve versus undermine self-regulation in those situations. In particular, the investigator tests the prediction that those who intuitively know what research reveals to be good versus bad for self-regulation will be better at attaining goals. Experiments also examine the factors that might explain why some are able, and others not, to engage in the right kinds of thinking styles at the right time. For example, some people may be more cognitively flexible--able to think about the same event from multiple perspectives--whereas others may not be so flexible. Studies examine to what extent cognitively flexible individuals may be better at self-regulation because of their ability to adopt the most advantageous thinking style at any given moment. To examine the practical implications of this work, a field study tests to what extent these hypotheses explain students' performance in a classroom context. Such a context is ideal in that it is a real-world situation known to present numerous self-regulation challenges. Understanding the factors that promote self-regulation may spur the development of new interventions and policies that enhance people's ability to behave in line with and eventually attain their valued goals.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3KkWMHMAAAAJ,"['self-control', 'motivation', 'goal pursuit', 'social cognition', 'judgment and decision-making']",10321,37,,,71,82,153,228,274,326,418,517,581,651,724,845,809,859,915,,,,817,801,929,97

However, many existing models for studying incipient social complexity overlook crucial variation in societies whose changing social-political order cannot readily be characterized as more or less hierarchical (e.g., when communities seem to be changing in composition, but not with evidence of increasing inequality.) Additionally, climatic instability and a changing resource base are frequently identified as factors contributing to social upheaval and reorganization. These issues have relevance to our own society, and examination can contribute to an understanding of the ways in which individuals in a society can react to and gird against dramatic ecological and environmental changes. How does resource scarcity or unpredictability affect community organization? And why does social inequality, as in this particular case study, not arise where we might expect it to? Archaeology in general, and this project specifically, is uniquely positioned to address these questions. Excavations for this project will be conducted at a site that has been subject to looting; this project will illustrate that looted sites can still be informative to researchers and should remain subject to protection. Community outreach in the form of talks and presentations to emphasize the importance of respecting and protecting local archaeological resources are a key part of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gregory D. Wilson and Jenna K.

During a time period when known changes occurred (such as the introduction of the bow and arrow, the introduction and spread of pottery, dramatic shifts in food resources, and increasing climatic instability), how was small-scale, village-level social organization changing as well? Using household-level data, obtained by excavation supported by  NSF but also from existing, un-analyzed collections, this project will investigate how individual household subsistence strategies compared to neighboring households, and will assess how space was used and organized differently. Spatial analyses include a method using chemical-isotopic levels in soil as a proxy for activity areas, as certain activities (such as eating and food processing) leave traces in soil visible long after the activities occurred. This project will also assess where certain features of village life were located: where were cooking and storage activities taking place? Inside the house, away from the eyes of others in the village? Or in open space, suggesting a communal orientation?

The study of speech enhancement strategies addresses important questions about human language, including how language is perceived by listeners and represented in the mind. Answering these questions is also vital to both speech therapy and speech technology. For speech therapy, this understanding can improve methods used in diagnosis and treatment of disordered speech. For speech technology, this understanding can improve speech recognition and synthesis, which are both used daily by the public, such as when calling a company's customer service. Knowledge of the way we enhance speech also helps researchers understand how and why languages change over time. This understanding is crucial for educating the public on linguistic diversity, change, and preservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to understand what enhancements occur when making nasal sounds, which are found in almost all languages of the world, including American English. Nasality is a common feature associated with an individual's voice: in any language, some speakers sound more nasal than others. This research focuses on how the voice is used to make sounds nasal. First, the researchers investigate whether speakers of American English and Brazilian Portuguese produce nasals with voice adjustments from the larynx. Second, they investigate how the perception of voice influences the perception of nasal sounds. These two languages differ in their use of nasal sounds, and so together they provide a better understanding of how different types of nasal sounds are made in different languages. This knowledge will help clarify how this particular type of sound is produced and perceived, which has the potential to improve techniques used to treat disordered speech as well as software used in speech recognition and synthesis.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AuWSm04AAAAJ,['Phonetics'],2545,25,,,,,,,,19,64,59,78,124,121,108,192,313,299,,,,301,344,417,34

Prosody has been named as one of the cues that listeners use to identify the ethnicity of speakers based on voice alone. This research project is an important step toward understanding what linguistic factors are relevant in ethnic profiling. The research has important implications for all social settings where AAE and EAE speakers interact, including educational settings, police-citizen interactions, political and legal discourse, and interactions in the context of employment. For example, previous research has linked ethnic identification of voices with societal issues such as denying housing or employment to minority speakers. Differences in prosody have also been shown to contribute to how AAE speaking children are misinterpreted in the classroom by mainstream American English speaking teachers; insights from this research could thus be used in training teachers about prosodic differences between ethnic varieties, thus improving the quality of education for AAE speaking children in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;African American English has been the source of much public and academic debate and remains among the most studied language varieties in the United States. Much sociolinguistic research has focused on the sound segments and syntactic structure of AAE, but only sporadic research has investigated its prosody, which includes patterns of rhythm and intonation. Prior research has suggested that some varieties of AAE exhibit different prosodic patterns than other varieties of English. This project uses psycholinguistic tasks to investigate how na闁肩厧鈧骏 listeners perceive prosodic prominence: words that listeners hear as ""highlighted by the speaker"" and that stand out from other, non-prominent words. In a series of experiments, listeners representing different social and regional backgrounds will rate the prosodic prominence of words in speech from speakers of both African American and Caucasian ethnicities. The results of this study will help uncover the phonetic cues that listeners use to perceive prosodic prominence and the role that the ethnicity of the speaker and listener plays in such perception.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cI4DyI0AAAAJ,"['Sociolinguistics', 'Corpus Linguistics', 'Phonetics']",2216,23,,,,11,13,32,38,75,58,118,118,140,126,176,151,228,228,,,,207,198,248,11

Anthropological archives document human diversity in the past and present. These data, which result from major private and public investments of time and resources, continue to be relevant to research today. They are used by scientists, citizens, and source community members to help answer questions that range from the communal to the global. However, this material is not being fully utilized because outdated and inappropriate archival descriptive practices make it impossible for researchers to locate and access collections. Despite increasingly robust online databases and search tools, valuable archival data remain hidden, often discovered only by chance. The research project funded by this award, led by Dr. Gabriela P闁肩厧宓恊z B閻犲鈧敒 and Dr. Joshua A. Bell (National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution), will address this problem by investigating anthropological needs and data-gathering practices to inform improved standards for archiving anthropological materials. The project will improve understanding of the role of anthropological archives in preserving data, facilitate access and discovery in anthropological archives, and help ensure that this material is both available to and usable by future researchers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will be carried out by a post-doctoral fellow based at the Smithsonian Institution's National Anthropological Archives (NAA). The NAA is the nation's largest anthropological archive and is an ideal location to carry out this research. As well as having extensive collections of different media from more than 130 anthropologists relating to some 2,000 cultures from around the globe, the NAA is contacted by hundreds of researchers each year, which provides a large study population. The fellow will be mentored by linguist P闁肩厧宓恊z Baez and cultural anthropologist Bell, with support from archivist Gina Rappaport.  During this three-year project, the research team will survey archive users to determine who they are, how they obtain access to these collections, and what impediments limit their use of collections. Results from this survey will then feed into the implementation of new cataloguing terms and metadata fields that will ensure the discoverability of materials. An initial set of three case studies will be developed to test these cataloguing techniques. Working with scholars and communities who have vested interests in these materials, this work will be refined, and the ethics involved in making this material accessible explored. Because of the increase in ""born digital"" data, the research team will also explore how to effectively bridge archival digital and analogue gaps. Results will be disseminated through participation in professional conferences, a workshop at the Smithsonian, and publications.

Researchers often measure babies' visual attention as a way to infer their understanding and interest. However, knowing that infants prefer to look at one display versus another does not necessarily indicate why they prefer it.   Some attentional preferences are driven by how much the infant seems to like the stimulus, referred to as its reward value. Other preferences are driven by infants' desire to take in new information and learn more about the world.  The goal of the proposed research is to study different patterns in babies' brain activity to determine which of these two reasons, reward value or information value, explains their attentional preferences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed experiments will use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure hemodynamic responses to neural activity in medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while infants watch and listen to two different speakers.  In some experiments, the speakers will differ in how friendly and infant-directed their speech is (i.e., social reward), while in others they will differ in how richly structured the content of their speech is (i.e., information value).  All experiments will end by testing to which speaker the infants prefer to attend and/or how much they have learned about the presented speech patterns.  These experiments will test the hypotheses that activation in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is associated with social reward value and activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with information value.  Moreover, they will assess the extent to which activation in MPFC and DLPFC during stimulus presentation predict subsequent social preference and statistical learning, respectively.

Thus, forming moral judgments of other people and interacting with them requires reasoning about their minds--a capacity known as theory of mind. For example, judging the morality of an action requires questions such as ""Did she INTEND to poison his coffee, or did she THINK it was sugar?"" Prior work has examined the role of theory of mind for moral judgment for some contexts, such as distinguishing intentional from accidental harms when people make judgments regarding third-party interactions. However, people are not mere observers. People are active participants in the social world; they consider the minds of their social partners with whom they are interacting. Theory of mind processes may differ in important ways for an active participant in an interaction. Understanding theory of mind in contexts where individuals' goals involve social connection and coordination versus strife and social distance may be of particular societal importance. For example, in a process called dehumanization, individuals distance themselves from being aware of others as thinking, feeling agents with intentions and minds. Research suggests people may dehumanize the enemy to justify their own aggression, either before aggressing or after the fact. Thus existing research reveals the importance of theory of mind for moral judgment, and it also provides clues that theory of mind might be modulated by social context. The current work addresses a key gap in theory of mind research, by examining systematically how theory of mind is deployed for social interaction in two distinct motivational contexts--competition and cooperation. This project uses methodological and theoretical approaches from social, cognitive and developmental psychology and neuroscience. Investigating the early emergence of differences in social cognition for competition versus cooperation and the underlying neural mechanisms will provide insight for scholars and policy makers into the scale and nature of the problems at hand. Ultimately, understanding social cognition across motivational contexts will shed light on societal problems, from political disagreement to ethnic discord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators consider three fundamental questions about the role of theory of mind in social interaction across motivational contexts. First, do distinct neural mechanisms support theory of mind for competition versus cooperation? Second, do distinct developmental trajectories underlie theory of mind across these contexts? Third, what are the social consequences of these differences for intergroup conflict, such as whether people support diplomatic efforts? The research will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural processes in typically developing adults and adults with autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction. To track the developmental trajectories, the research will apply novel paradigms to typically developing children between 3 and 5 years of age, an age group associated with emerging theory of mind capacities. To investigate the social consequences of possible differences in theory of mind processes and to test the impact of an intervention, the research will examine existing groups in society with a history of conflict. By integrating social psychological, developmental, and cognitive neuroscientific methods, the project aims to provide a comprehensive account of how theory of mind operates in real and consequential contexts of social interaction. In addition, testing whether cognitive impairments are associated with an inability to distinguish between these contexts will also advance our understanding of the cognitive capacities that enable most people to be able to make such distinctions. Finally, the research may provide preliminary guidance on how situations of potential intergroup conflict may be reduced via theory of mind processes.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7KcPpn8AAAAJ,"['morality', 'theory of mind', 'emotion', 'fMRI', 'social psychology']",29380,63,,,,266,998,1366,1473,1414,1519,1608,1657,1655,1780,1927,2039,2049,2026,,,,2261,2208,2327,201

Although often understood as a phenomenon that is transmitted across generations, growing up in an aggressive household does not necessarily lead to aggressive romantic relationships.  Identifying factors associated with resilience versus risk for young adult dating aggression is an important step for developing effective and targeted educational and intervention programs.  Much of the prior research focuses on static individual characteristics to identify who is at risk for dating aggression. However, this study focuses on the dynamic interplay between individual, contextual and emotion regulation processes as they unfold in real time. Conflict sensitization theories, which guide this study, propose that conflict can be escalated when individuals experience both heightened physiological arousal and behavioral and emotional sensitivity. Young adult dating couples are relatively unfamiliar with the challenges of handling conflict in romantic relationships. Therefore they offer a prime opportunity for understanding how conflict is triggered in everyday interactions and for linking conflict patterns to earlier family relationships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study advances science by taking the study of dating aggression out of the laboratory and into real-world, ecologically-valid home environments. The study examines everyday interactions between dating partners, and how individuals adjust and adapt, a process called ""self-regulation,"" via behavioral, physiological, emotional, and vocal processes. Such processes will vary in dating couples' home environments as a function of naturally-occurring changes in relationship stress. These measures capture regulatory processes that will be time-linked to couple irritation and conflict, allowing for the assessment of the beginning phases of negative escalation cycles.  Smartphone technology is used to capture momentary assessment of partners' activities, emotions, spoken words, vocally encoded arousal, and physical proximity. Mobile health technologies assess physiological arousal through measurements of skin conductance and heart rate.

But this is particularly the case for people who work with adolescents with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. Their interactions with others challenge our understanding of what a social relationship is and could be.  For typically developing children, language begins with what researchers call the ""basic affiliative need"" -- the emotional need for connection -- that compels infants to imitate others and interpret their intentions in increasingly effective ways.  This observation raises intriguing questions when it comes to interactions involving individuals who neither imitate nor use conventional signs.  What are the effects of the ""basic affiliative need"" felt by the family members, aids, therapists, and teachers who live and work in close proximity with adolescents with severe and profound intellectual disabilities?  How do cultural norms and institutional constraints influence how they treat adolescents in their midst?  How do they learn to connect with their loved ones, clients, and students across what might appear to be an unbridgeable gulf?

The question is important because while many smallholder farmers live in areas significant for conservation, they also often suffer from high levels of poverty, which may lead them to shift away from strictly agricultural-based modes of living. Environmentally sustainable efforts to increase good land stewardship and governance of protected territories over generations may thus be confounded by increased circulation between rural-urban spaces and changing expectations and desires. Understanding the effects of urbanization and inter-generational changes at the local scale is crucial for broader discussions on the role of smallholder farming in protected areas in our nation's future.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To investigate these issues, Indiana University anthropology graduate student Lucy Miller, who is supervised by Dr. Eduardo S. Brondizio, will travel the Gurup閻?Melga闁煎墽閮?extractive reserve, a protected area of the Brazilian Amazon. She has chosen this region because it is home to extensive protected areas as well as to many impoverished smallholder farmers. This combination makes the conflicts between the two more apparent and easier to study than they would be in a more developed context. The global trends of rapid urbanization and processes of rural livelihood diversification are reflected in increasing reliance on cash income from public sector jobs and government welfare programs in urban centers. In this context, the researchers will investigate what impact rural-urban mobility has on livelihood strategies, resource governance across generations, and rural identity formation. The researcher will gather data through a combination of social scientific methods, including semi-structured and in-depth interviews, documentation of the types of rules and social norms in three of the reserve's communities, and household interviews in each community to ascertain intra-community variation and the role of mobility in collective action, rule compliance, contestation, and conflicts.

Research on the evolution of human behavior suggests that the human capacity for cooperation may be partially a result of our earliest ancestors' need to cope with variable climates and resource scarcity. This issue is of particular importance in the present when even the world's most remote populations are affected by both global economic integration and the effects of climate change. Cooperation often provides a viable solution for both communities and national governments to mitigate the negative effects of risks such as economic crises, transnational resource conflicts, and threats to national security. However, efforts at cooperation are often stymied by resource shortages, conflict, and the competing goals of populations and interest groups. The proposed research will focus on the individual and community-level responses to natural disasters among a small group of nomadic herders that are highly susceptible to severe weather.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Conte, under the supervision of Dr. Lee Cronk of Rutgers University, will explore what impact environmental risk has on the development and maintenance of cooperation and community resilience. The research will be conducted among two communities of nomadic livestock herders living in sub-arctic northern Mongolia. This site is selected for exploration as it is highly susceptible to severe winter disaster conditions (known as zud in Mongolian) in which severely cold temperatures or blizzard conditions cause widespread livestock mortality. In the most severe cases, winter disasters can lead to the loss of families' entire herds and millions of livestock deaths on a national scale. Thus, they represent a major contributor to rural poverty in the region. Given that northern Mongolia is distant from major urban centers, herders must rely on their own efforts to both prepare for and recover from winter disasters, and these efforts often come in the form of cooperation with other herding families. The researchers will assess how livestock herders respond to natural disasters by analyzing herders' social networks of labor exchange, interviewing families regarding their efforts to prepare for and recover from natural disasters, and comparing individuals' willingness to cooperate with others during disasters in an experimental economic scenario. This research will employ semi-structured interviews, social network analysis, and experimental economic games. Findings from this research will provide greater insight on how environmental risk affects the development and maintenance of cooperation in small-scale societies. In addition, research findings can also inform future policy directions on how community-based decision making and cooperation can increase communities' resilience to natural disasters both in Mongolia and the United States.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=11D248AAAAAJ,"['Human evolutionary ecology', 'Human behavioral ecology', 'Cultural ecology', 'Human cooperation', 'Signaling theory']",5298,35,79,118,154,140,101,145,212,161,152,191,203,185,219,221,308,342,328,62,67,58,386,354,438,39

Some approaches rest on the assumption that occupational effects arise from the differential social needs and goals that speakers have in different occupations. However, this perspective has never been investigated using large-scale, quantitative data within a single workplace. The current study is an analysis of the use of six Southern vowels by speakers in a range of occupations within a single firm. The current study will address: 1) whether required job skills correlate with Southern features 2) which features individuals manipulate on the job versus in casual settings 3) experiences of linguistic discrimination within the workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work investigates the use of Southern features among workers at a single technology firm, providing a more nuanced picture of the relationship between occupation and linguistic features. Individuals may show linguistic grouping based on different job skills illustrating the role of the workplace in sorting individuals into the groups seen in the aggregate. With the addition of stylistic data from casual, work, and interview settings, this study can more accurately pinpoint which Southern features speakers avoid for workplace situations. Lastly, speakers' recounting of experiences of linguistic discrimination within the workplace will highlight the social consequences that Southern speakers may face on the job. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will further our understanding of how linguistic discrimination operates within the workplace, and it will specifically identify which features of the Southern Vowel Shift receive the greatest degree of stigma. The specific experiences of linguistic discrimination will help to bring awareness to the importance of language in promoting subconscious discriminatory practices, allowing for public policy that directly addresses these issues.

Many Americans are natively bilingual or multilingual speakers and many others study various languages as a second language. Also, speakers of different languages from other countries learn English when they come to the US. An important component of learning and using multiple languages is establishing the sound categories that are appropriate to each of the languages. Many languages use similar sounds, but how they are actually pronounced varies from language to language. This research will contribute to our understanding of how speakers of different languages facilitate their language's sound contrasts through dynamic tongue movement. By understanding the difference in tongue dynamics across languages, second language learners, instructors, and speech therapists can have a more detailed understanding of the phonetic differences between one's native language and target language, even when the two seem phonologically similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on how similar sounds across languages are articulated differently. For example, the consonant at the beginning of the word 'dog' in English ('d'), is similar to 'd' in Portuguese (e.g. 'dados'), but differences in the production of 'd' emerge when the two languages are examined closely. Portuguese 'd' is phonated, which means the vocal folds are vibrating while the tongue is constricted in the mouth to produce this sound, whereas English 'd' is often not phonated during tongue constriction. While the vibration of the vocal folds can be inferred through acoustic analysis, this current research asks what articulatory adjustments may be used in order to produce the acoustic differences that distinguish the production of similar sounds across languages. Articulations in the mouth can be observed using ultrasound imaging, revealing how the tongue moves to adjust the shape of the mouth. For example, we can see how the tongue position of English 'd' is different from that of Portuguese 'd', which may help us understand how phonation is achieved within this dynamic system. This study first focuses on how the phonetic target of voiced stops (such as the 'd' of English or Portuguese) in different languages compares acoustically and articulatorily, and second, how tongue position reflects different systems of voicing contrast by comparing six different languages: English, German, (Brazilian) Portuguese, Korean, Hindi, and Thai. The articulatory, acoustic and theoretical methods used to address this issue can be extended beyond the six languages covered in this study. The collective results in different languages can be applied to second language learning, with a more detailed account of consonant articulation across languages.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=i8jvUgUAAAAJ,"['Phonetics', 'Laboratory Phonology', 'Second Language Acquisition']",3012,28,29,37,71,61,64,81,90,140,106,149,159,215,190,191,226,230,212,,,19,211,191,230,27

This project addresses how much communicative input children require to eventually develop adult-like language proficiency. It will examine whether the source of the communicative input affects eventual fluency to determine if child learners benefit more from an adult language model or the model provided by same-aged peers. This project also will examine whether the emergence of a new language in a community of speakers or signers parallels or diverges from emergence in a single child who is isolated from users of a fully established sign language.  The findings from this study may inform educational policy and pedagogy for the deaf.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These issues will be addressed by studying the gestural communication strategies invented by deaf children and adults who live in Guatemala. Because of their deafness, the participants in this study do not have access to the spoken language in their community, and there is not an established sign language in use in their town. The systems that deaf individuals create under such circumstances are called ""homesign systems."" Language-like features in these systems emerged in the absence of a language model. Thus the participants in this study lack language input, but they do have a model in the form of other homesign systems created by the other deaf individuals with whom they interact. Under the direction of Dr. Brentari, Ms. Horton will work with families with multiple generations of deafness as well as with deaf children who attend school together. The homesign input that a deaf child receives from a deaf adult relative is construed as a vertical form of transmission, whereas the homesign contact that deaf children attending school together experience is construed as horizontal transmission. The project will analyze the signs that each participant from a different social context produces to understand whether horizontal or vertical transmission accelerates the consistency of the forms and the grammar in each homesign system. Results from this study will be compared to datasets from other homesigners who have had little or no contact with deaf people as well as to native signers who use a more established sign language like American Sign Language.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AVT2-U4AAAAJ,"['sign language', 'gesture', 'phonology', 'morphology', 'prosody']",6479,42,62,63,92,102,135,105,216,190,218,216,253,305,345,514,371,443,426,62,80,92,561,602,561,37

Accordingly, it has become a commonly taught language in foreign language programs in the United States, and thus an increasingly large number of native English speakers are learning Chinese. Importantly, Chinese and English differ in the types of information they use to convey meaning in words: unlike English, Chinese uses lexical tones (i.e., pitch movement) to contrast word meanings (e.g., in Chinese, the word ""ma"" can mean mother, hemp, horse, or scold depending on its lexical tone). This difference between Chinese and English poses word recognition difficulties for English-speaking learners of Chinese. This doctoral dissertation project examines how native Chinese listeners and proficient adult English-speaking learners of Chinese use tonal information in word recognition as the speech signal unfolds in time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two visual-world eye-tracking experiments will be conducted to investigate three potential differences between native Chinese listeners and English learners of Chinese in their use of tonal information in word recognition: (i) their potentially different sensitivities to the early pitch height of the tone (high vs. low); (ii) their potentially different sensitivities to fine-grained variability in this early pitch height; and (iii) their potentially different abilities to use the complete pitch contour of the tone. It is hypothesized that the time course of use of tonal information will differ between Chinese and English listeners, with English listeners showing more sensitivity to fine-grained early pitch height information than Chinese listeners (suggesting less categorical perception of lexical tones) but ultimately having more difficulty in using pitch contour information in word recognition. The findings of this research will make an important contribution to the understanding of how tonal information modulates word recognition in native Chinese listeners and English-speaking learners of Chinese, and it will have pedagogical implications for the teaching of Chinese.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7WwBi50AAAAJ,"['second language acquisition', 'speech perception', 'spoken word recognition']",2353,24,,,,6,24,17,38,31,66,78,100,121,142,135,174,183,148,,,,272,365,366,37

At the heart of these issues are the emotional experiences and reactions of individuals in their daily lives. Some research has examined ideological differences in emotional reactions and attitudes toward outgroups. This project examines more complex, deliberative processes namely, the ways in which individuals attempt to control or regulate their emotions in various domains of life. Understanding the various ways in which people regulate their emotions has implications not only for understanding ideological differences in fundamental emotional processes, but also for the outcomes of these processes. Furthermore, an appreciation of the different types of emotion regulation strategies that work best may hold the key to developing interventions designed to improve personal well-being as well as relations among various groups in society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves three phases designed to illuminate ideological differences in emotion regulation processes in these two domains of life, explain these differences, and to develop catered interventions based on these differences. In 11 studies conducted in two countries (the United States and Israel, the latter of which is supported by the Israeli government), Dr. John Jost from New York University and his Israeli collaborator, Dr. Eran Halperin, will combine different methodologies to meet all three objectives. The first phase examines and maps how ideology shapes emotion regulation in the two domains using large-scale surveys, experience sampling, and EEG. In the second stage they examine four possible mechanisms that may drive ideological differences in emotion regulation through experimental manipulation of these mechanisms.

The ever more prevalent outbreaks of food-borne illnesses have caused consternation across the world over the safety of our food. For example, in 2014, the European Union (EU) alone issued 3,792 food recall alerts, ranging from dangerous bacteria to defective packaging. These threats of food contaminants have pushed the World Health Organization and the United Nations to incorporate food traceability - the ability to track a food product's origins - into their initiatives for assuring a secure global food supply. Public health officials view documentation about food's origins and pathways as a necessary component of controlling risk within the supply chain. In practice, however, food traceability regulation often does not take the values of safety, quality, and knowledge of food producers into account. Understanding how the local conditions of food production conflict with food safety regulation is critical for developing better policies to protect all Americans from the dangers of food contaminants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Gregory Kohler, under the supervision of Dr. Keith Murphy of the University of California at Irvine, will investigate the dynamics of data collection and regulation of food supply chains.

The methods include participant observation in the dairy cooperative headquarters and member farms, interviews with farmers, managers, inspectors, and regulators, video-based linguistic anthropological data collection and analysis, and behavioral experiments involving the collaborative analysis of video and audio data with informants.

This research explores these questions through an ethnographic study of interdisciplinary research teams at three U.S. universities that are seeking to develop computer-assisted speech analysis technologies for mental health applications. In the research teams that this study focuses on, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychologists and engineers are working together to develop technology that can be used to diagnose and track mental illness by analyzing the formal, acoustic properties of speech (such as pitch, timbre, intonation, and speed), bypassing its semantic content (what the words mean) altogether. The project will have implications for the mental health researchers themselves as they move into uncharted ethical domains in regards to privacy, surveillance, and the increased diagnostic reliance on experimental technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beth Semel, under the supervision of Dr. Graham Jones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explores how experts across disciplinary boundaries collaborate to design, develop and test artificial intelligence-enabled technologies when they appear to hold very different assumptions about the relationship between language and inner, psychological states. The researcher hypothesizes that collaborations surrounding the development of these technologies not only enact fundamental tensions within dominant views about how language works, but also reflect a re-working of claims of authority and expertise within U.S. mental health care. Increasingly, mental health researchers are eschewing traditional techniques of psychiatric diagnosis, which depend upon patients' subjective, verbal accounts of their psychological states and clinicians' observational and interpretive skills. Instead, they are enlisting the expertise of computer engineers who use AI techniques of pattern recognition to decipher the biomedical significance of behavioral symptoms. Using ethnographic participant observation, the researcher will collect data about how psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists and engineers work together to design, test, and develop voice analysis technologies. Focusing on teams situated at the confluence of academic, commercial, and military arenas, this study explores the variety of ways in which mental illness is conceptualized in terms of scientific, public health, and national security concerns.

We achieve this by planning our initial contact with the object with the end goal in mind, even when the end goal requires multiple steps to be achieved. Thus, the process of action planning involves integration of perception, cognition, and motor behavior. Presumably, a similar integrative process occurs when we anticipate other people's goals while observing them perform actions. Previous work shows that action planning begins in infancy and improves with age, but little is known about the accompanying brain activity that underlies these age-related improvements. This interdisciplinary study combines concepts, methods, and analytic techniques from developmental psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to understand age-related changes in action planning while children 1) perform an action with multiple steps to the goal and 2) while they observe someone else perform the action. The research uses a novel combination of recording methods for children: Video, eye tracking, motion tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG) will be recorded simultaneously. The methods and data will advance the field through open sharing of the research videos and physiological data in the Databrary repository. Algorithms and analysis techniques will be shared in the Open Science Framework. <br/><br/>The investigators combine behavioral measures, neural activity recordings, and machine-learning techniques in order to understand how children and adults 1) perform complex motor tasks that involve anticipation of the end-goal and 2) passively observe others performing tasks that involve multi-step action planning in anticipation of the end-goal. Analyses of action performance will focus on the neural correlates of behavior at different stages of planning and will assess whether neural activity prior to beginning a movement can predict trial-to-trial behavioral variability in young children's ability to plan. Analyses of action observation will investigate age differences in neural activity while observing others performing actions that do, or do not, show evidence of long-range planning. The investigators will also compare the neurophysiological signatures of anticipation during passive action observation and during action performance. These findings will inform our understanding of the development of action planning across childhood.

A decentralized project is a small-scale treatment system operated in a city drain, a neighborhood, or an institutional setting without long distance transfers of wastewater through underground and above-ground pipes.  But the planning and effective operation of these projects require wholesale changes not only in technology but also in institutional frameworks and systems of governance, which produces a nexus of effects across scales that is not yet well understood.  The research funded by this award will address this information gap. Anthropologist Dr. Kelly D. Alley (Auburn University) and her team will study the interactions between institutional structures, governance mechanisms, geophysical landscapes of wastewater flows, and cultural practices in the context of decentralized responses to water contamination and shortage. Their project will also produce case studies in treatment, recycling, water monitoring, and environmental regulation that can be shared across communities and countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken in India, where a wide range of decentralized water reuse and pollution reduction experiments and pilot programs are planned or underway in the heavily polluted Ganges river basin.

It is the combination of these factors that makes a sample of Ganges-related projects ideal for investigating the intersectional effects of decentralized wastewater treatment approaches. The cross-project comparison will allow the researchers to identify the cultural, institutional and political conditions and constraints that make decentralized projects institutionally feasible, financially viable, and culturally acceptable.

As one example, the way that words like ""know"" and ""think"" are used within a conversation reflects how sure the conversational participants are about what they believe, whether they agree about what they are discussing, and what they take to be facts or opinions. This project examines how children come to understand how belief words like ""know"" and ""think"" contribute to the exchange of information within a conversation. Do children from different backgrounds have similar experiences with these words? And to the degree that there are differences, how does that variation contribute to differences in acquiring an adult-like understanding of these words? To answer these questions, this project first conducts corpus analyses to investigate how parents use belief words in talking to their preschool-aged children. Then, these corpus results are combined with behavioral methods to reveal how linguistic experience relates to children's mastery of these words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding out how children come to learn words like ""know"" and ""think"" is important in understanding contributing factors to later academic and professional success. Specifically, these words require an understanding of the ways that information is exchanged and communicated through conversations. As a result, understanding these words leads to mastery in interpreting what their conversational partners believe and why they believe it. This, in turn, allows children to better understand academic and professional communication and may lead to greater achievement in school, and ultimately, in their careers.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_3VocksAAAAJ,['Semantics'],3360,26,,,15,34,39,69,69,78,102,132,196,216,292,269,284,308,288,,,,318,325,263,17

Social scientists have documented the enivronmental controversies and local resistance that sometimes accompany these practices, as well as the movements calling for more sustainable and environemtnally benign forms of energy. But less attention has been paid to communities that favor petroleum development.  That is the subject of the research supported by this award, which will be undertaken by University of Colorado doctoral student, Gregorio Ortiz, under the supervision of anthropologist, Dr. Jerry K. Jacka. The researchers ask: How do communities that support fracking engage with the environmental discourse against it? How do people in such communities understand their place within environmental discourse and are these conceptions affected by their support of extractive development?  Is local extractive development, in turn, affected by the sensibilites of local communities? Findings from this research will fill critical gaps in scientific understanding of the social and environmental impacts of resource extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted around the on-going development of the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. The region is an appropriate site because it has a long history of petroleum development and natural environmental challenges, such as drought. The oil boom of the 1970s and 1980s shaped the area's recent history even though it did not always lead to infrastructural development nor improved livelihoods. Consequently, the subsequent resource ""bust"" has affected local livelihoods in complex ways, which makes the study of why local residents support further petroleum development particularly interesting. Ortiz will focus on the communities of the Middle Rio Grande Development Council of Governments in south Texas. He will use a mix of social science methods beginning with archival research; semi-structured interviews with both governmental and non-governmental local and state representatives whose work engages the petroleum industry; and participant observations and interviews with petroleum industry workers. He will then move on to in-depth ethnography, participant observation, and surveys in two local communities. Data collection activities will include interviews, focus groups, and local land and resource mapping. The researcher will highlight how environmental concerns do and do not inform development policy and projects, and if and how perspectives on the environment have changed since the development of the Eagle Ford Shale began.

While anthropologists have pointed to the intensely varied nature of medical travel experiences, there remains much to be understood about the different kinds of healthcare concerns which drive medical travel, as well as how individuals and families navigate financial, bureaucratic, and other systems to obtain care abroad. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirically-grounded, scientific research, seeks to understand how individuals' and families' desires for particular healthcare treatments (e.g. cancer screenings and treatments) may influence their temporary or long-term migrations to the U.S. and elsewhere, as well as how their shifting healthcare concerns may evidence changing ideas regarding illness, health, and expectations of healthcare systems. Understanding these factors is imperative to informing programs and policies that respond to the shifting nature of contemporary, global healthcare seeking, particularly as it impacts migrations to and the use of healthcare services in the U.S. and elsewhere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zakea Boeger, under the supervision of Dr. Jan Brunson of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, will examine the factors impacting travel to service healthcare needs. This yearlong research project will be conducted in Nuku'alofa, Kingdom of Tonga, where the researcher has conducted previous work. As the Tongan government supports a publically funded healthcare system, Nuku'alofa is an apt site for identifying key healthcare concerns that drive individuals to seek healthcare abroad, and to draw on often-limited resources to do so. Scientific research of medical travel has tended to focus on populations with more extensive resources to finance travel for medical purposes, so this site offers an opportunity to test a number of prevailing assumptions about the drivers of medical travel. The researcher will engage in extensive interviews with individuals and families who have engaged in and/or plan to engage in medical travel, so as to gain an understanding of the motivations for and means by which individuals are able to access health care abroad. Interviews will provide insight into the possible relationship between Tongans' primary medical travel destinations (e.g. the U.S.) and contemporary, ongoing Tongan and Pacific migration to the U.S. and elsewhere. Interviews will also consider how medical travel experiences may be intertwined with shifting socio-cultural notions of health, appropriate health care, and resultant expectations of healthcare systems in Tonga and abroad.

A key component of this is interpreting the reasons for others' actions. Infants appear to be able to determine others' goals based on observing others' actions early in life, and this sensitivity to others' goals is associated with developments in infants' own ability to perform goal-based actions. The purpose of this project is to investigate the neural and cognitive systems that support infants' emerging sensitivity to goal-based actions in themselves and others.

A first goal of the research is to characterize the neural processes that are involved when infants learn to engage in new actions and social collaborations. A second goal is to test the prediction that these neural processes also support infants' understanding of others' goal-directed actions. To address these issues, the research will evaluate networks of neural activity as infants act and observe others' actions, and will assess whether these patterns of neural activity predict when infants are able to respond appropriately to others' goal-directed actions. Beyond addressing the focal research questions, the proposed studies will generate new approaches to analyzing infant neural and cognitive development, and the findings of these studies with typically-developing infants may help to shed light on developmental disorders that affect social cognition and social behavior.

Children seem to learn their first language effortlessly and rapidly. By three years of age, most children appear to speak in fully grammatical sentences and are able to learn up to ten new words every day. How language acquisition happens continues to be one of the driving questions in language research and an important one for all fields related to early childhood development. Knowing how children acquire a first language is crucial for understanding how a second language is learned and therefore is important for understanding how to more quickly integrate immigrant children into English-language schools in the US. This knowledge will also allow us to improve our toolkits for helping children who are challenged by language delays or by language impairments associated with developmental disorders such as Specific Language Impairment, Down Syndrome, and Autism Spectrum Disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project looks at the development of subject-verb agreement, which is the element of grammar that allows us to distinguish between ""The sheep grazes"" and ""The sheep graze"", for example. Research to date suggests that children can produce subject-verb agreement accurately before they comprehend it. This appears to be a paradox because it is generally assumed that children understand language structures before they begin to produce them in speech. This study will investigate how English-speaking preschoolers' brains process this grammatical feature, and how well children produce and comprehend it, to develop a model of the relationship between these abilities as they develop between the ages of 3 and 5 years. Children's number skills will also be measured to look at whether their conception of the number line influences how well they comprehend the singular-plural distinction of subject-verb agreement, which is marked on English regular verbs by ""-s"" or no ""-s"". This dissertation grant will support the first study to investigate this question with a comprehensive approach that takes into account neural processing, production and comprehension of the sentences, as well as cognitive maturational factors, including maturation of numeracy skills. The results of this study will help us to understand grammatical development in English-speaking children and validate an approach to research on child language development that can be extended to other languages in which the same apparent paradox has been observed, including, German, French, Spanish, and the Bantu language Xhosa.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0v-90YX6MGUC,"['Language development', 'Neuroscience', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech and Language Disorders']",3112,29,25,49,49,96,50,73,80,127,127,145,197,189,195,208,186,222,198,13,15,39,254,235,235,27

In other words, your eyes don't continuously move left to right when reading English. Instead, your eye movements are often interrupted as you return to look at one or more previously read portions of the text. It has been assumed that returning to earlier parts of a sentence helps the reader understand the text. Although reading an entire text multiple times does result in a more detailed understanding, no studies have yet shown that readers' selective backwards eye movements are related to specific corrections of earlier misinterpretations or even to more accurate understanding. It is also not known how individual readers differ with respect to how they re-read, or whether individual strategies or patterns of re-reading behavior are related to better reading comprehension. Reading is fundamental to learning, education, and daily life and reading difficulties can hinder learning in all areas. Thus, understanding how real-time reading behaviors relate to comprehension is critically important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During normal, skilled silent reading, approximately 15% of eye movements return to earlier portions of the text (i.e., they are ""regressive""). Regressions are typically triggered by some sort of disruption to the normal forward progress through the text and subsequent re-reading is typically interpreted as a reanalysis, revision, or reprocessing of some or all of the previously read text. This reprocessing is generally taken as an indication that the reader has derived a more accurate, grammatically licensed interpretation. However, in the psycholinguistic and reading literatures, the actual affect of these re-reading behaviors on comprehension has been largely assumed.  Moreover, studies have not linked the various aspects of re-reading (location of regressions, scan paths during re-reading, time spent re-reading, as so on) to accuracy rates on comprehension probes of the type often used in educational assessments of reading comprehension. The proposed project includes three series of eye-tracking experiments that examine (1) the triggers for regressions; (2) the type of reprocessing performed during re-reading; (3) the influence of re-reading on reading comprehension; and (4) individual differences in working memory capacity and reading fluency on re-reading and text comprehension. The proposed project is a large-scale systematic exploration of the fundamental assumption that re-reading enhances comprehension.

In many societies, such as the United States, there is a hierarchy of leadership positions corresponding to spatial administrative hierarchies, such as of cities, counties, states, and the Federal government. In other societies, such hierarchies do not exist and the rights and duties of leaders are not formally delineated. This global variability has produced an equal variety of scholarly theories; nonetheless, leadership remains poorly understood. For example, why do some leaders use physical threats and aggression to instill fear in their followers, but other leaders attract followers with their skills and knowledge? Some theories emphasize our primate heritage: in groups of primates, physically stronger individuals can dominate physically weaker individuals. This might help explain why some human leaders physically threaten their followers. Other theories point to the importance of leaders in promoting human cooperation: leaders might be needed to maintain cooperation in large groups by organizing the division of labor and punishing free-riders. Alternatively, leaders might be important during warfare and other forms of conflict between groups. Still other theories emphasize the transmission of valuable knowledge from one generation to the next, which might explain why leaders often have superior skills and abilities. These theories have important implications for selecting and training leaders in a broad number of roles, such as in schools; local, state, and federal government agencies; businesses; and numerous other organizations. Unfortunately, none of these theories has been tested systematically across the full range of social types. Therefore, to address this gap, Washington State University anthropologist, Dr. Edward H. Hagen, will test theories of leadership using the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), a database of millions of digitized pages of books, articles and other documents that describe hundreds of different societies. The HRAF database captures much of the known cultural diversity of human society and can be used for a wide, cross-cultural test of several influential theories of leadership.<br/><br/>The investigator will begin by operationalizing key theories of leadership from anthropology, psychology, sociology, and biology to produce set of variables that will be used to code each ethnographic account of leadership in the HRAF. The coded accounts will then be used to test these theories. Second, the texts discussing the qualities and functions of leaders, and the costs and benefits of leadership for both leaders and followers, will be isolated and coded for analyses providing the first systematic cross-cultural data on these subjects. Third, the HRAF material will be subject to meta-ethnographic and text-mining techniques, such as latent semantic analysis, with the goal of identifying commonalities and differences among the reported cases and cultural models of leadership. The research will give the emerging subdiscipline of evolutionary leadership theory a comprehensive cross-cultural foundation and provide an empirical basis for future evolutionary and cultural models of leadership. The database produced by the project will be made available to other scholars and to the general public. The methodology used will be a model for future investigations using the HRAF.

Out of doors, males tend to range farther than females and are more confident in their navigational abilities, and males also outperform females on many spatial tasks. One explanation for these effects is that having the opportunity to navigate through larger areas may enhance both spatial skills and confidence. These behavioral differences appear in middle childhood, and have the potential to shape spatial learning throughout life. This study will investigate these relationships among children in three foraging societies, to explore how children's mobility affects spatial learning and confidence, and why these often differ between girls and boys.  Children in these societies have greater exposure to the natural environment than children in industrialized societies, and are given greater latitude for independent spatial exploration, which are likely to provide a learning environment conducive to good spatial and navigational ability.  As a result, studying this question cross-culturally provides an opportunity to more directly examine the impact of spatial exploration and navigation on the development of spatial cognition. The outcomes of the research will have important insights for optimizing spatial reasoning across cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will include children 7 to 12 years old, and will take place in three populations that depend in whole or part on foraging for sustenance and therefore permit significant opportunities for ranging across large natural spaces: the Hadza (Tanzania), the Twe (Namibia), and the Tsimane (Bolivia).  Data on natural mobility (from GPS tracking and interview), spatial performance (spatial visualization and navigation), and spatial risk-taking will be used to answer three questions: (1) Is greater mobility in childhood associated with enhanced spatial confidence and performance?  (2) Do gender differences in mobility stem from gender differences in risk preference?  (3) How are mobility and wayfinding shaped by environmental factors?  The three societies live in habitats that vary in both resource patchiness and in landmark visibility; based on their earlier work with adults, the investigators expect greater resource patchiness to increase male mobility, and greater landmark visibility to enhance reliance on male-typical wayfinding strategies.

Linguists do this by comparing a set of languages along various dimensions, such as words or language structures that may have a common origin. Documentation of individual languages plays a key role in how scholars reconstruct the family relationships between languages, but with little or no documentation, it is highly challenging to make conclusive determinations of the linguistic relationships.  This project will investigate a small set of five endangered languages which are related to each other, according to the existing small sets of data.  These languages are poorly documented due to being spoken only in a remote, conflict-ridden area, inaccessible except by footpaths. This project will also research whether these languages are related to others in the neighboring geographic region by documenting the individual languages in this group, and by making comparisons between specific words and other linguistic features of each of the languages.  The dissertation will increase the linguistic understanding of the five targeted languages and their relationships with each other and with other languages in the region. This dissertation will also add deeper insight to the less frequent type of patterns (""typology"") in the sound systems and in grammar of these languages by collecting and analyzing new documentation. The documentation will serve not only linguists and educators but also anthropologists and historians interested in the inhabitants of a virtually forgotten area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this dissertation project, doctoral student Manuel Otero will document the endangered languages, including a comparative vocabulary of the Koman peoples.

Aside from Uduk, the Koman languages are only spoken in Africa, so fieldwork will be carried out primarily in Ethiopia for the Komo, Gwama, Opuo and Dana languages. Little is known about the Koman languages and peoples, as the terrain these groups have inhabited for centuries is rugged and primarily communicable by footpaths. Most Koman people continue traditional practices, including hunting and gathering alongside subsistence farming. Impacted by more than a century of strife and conflict, these populations continue to dwindle and some of their languages are on the verge of extinction, in urgent need of documentation. The primary research questions concern developing an understanding of their sound systems and grammar, their interrelationships, and how Koman relates to larger African language families, which is still under debate. Typologically rare grammatical features in Koman include temporal distinctions made by suffixes that primarily indicate direction of movement and track the location of participants. Such systems are important to the study of human language and cognition, as they show how grammatical material can evolve.

Understanding this process has practical value in a world where language barriers and foreign language learning are increasingly important, where new media and new forms of language use (for example, as on the Internet) play an increasingly large role, and where algorithms that seek to bestow computers with understanding of human languages are proliferating and have increasing impact on day-to-day life. Within the field of psycholinguistics, the most common approach is to take languages as given and to study the processes by which humans comprehend and produce utterances in those languages. Here, using ideas from functional linguistics, quantitative typology, and evolution, workshop participants will explore the reverse approach. Taking some knowledge of human information processing as given, participants will examine systematic differences among languages, variation among grammatical constructions within languages, and the diachronic emergence and development of language structures. Using this evolutionary view of language, presenters will discuss novel hypotheses about the relationships between processing and linguistic structure, and shed new light on how human language operates both within speakers and over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is for a special conference session, Language Processing and Language Evolution, to be held in conjunction with the 30th Annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing.

Previous scholarship on hunting of guanaco (a form of lama) indicates that hunter-gatherers were able to sustainably hunt the species for the last 4,000 years. This pattern is unique in that most archaeological studies of long term hunting of large wild game indicate that people overhunt prey populations, causing serious declines. What were the factors that enabled people to sustainably hunt large game in this aridland context over the long term? Analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) from guanaco will enable archaeologists to learn about hunter-gatherer, large-game interactions in this context, which is relevant to hunting practices (contemporary and archaeological) in many other areas of the world. The guanaco and human populations in this region were migratory, taking advantage of the productive Andean river valleys during the summer; thus, an important aspect of this research is to determine if the geographic component of migration contributed to an ability to hunt sustainably. The research team will use new approaches in aDNA analysis, previously unexplored in archaeology. Thus, this research represents a substantial advancement through the use of new methods, which can be employed to study human hunting of large game in many areas of the world. The approaches refined in this study will be relevant to the study of aDNA from any species (including humans) in any part of the world when archaeologists are concerned with how populations grew or declined over time. .

This study is of particular interest because hunter-gatherers there seem to have figured out how to hunt sustainably. Understanding of this process has potential implications for managing migratory species today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wolverton and his research team will examine the impacts of hunting on guanaco population genetics over time; in addition, whether or not guanaco populations remained geographically connected across the region during the last 4000 years will be studied through analysis of aDNA. The research will be conducted in the aDNA laboratory at the University of North Texas on samples from southern Mendoza Province, Argentina. Hunter-gatherers in the study region occupied the desert and steppe environments of the arid Andean escarpment, today occupied by migratory herders. The research, thus, links past hunter-gatherers to contemporary ranchers who use the same seasonal migratory patterns between the lowlands and Andean river valleys. The outcome will be an interdisciplinary dataset that can be combined with existing data on physical geography, stone tool resource use, stable-isotope analysis of animal bone, archaeobotanical analysis, and study of site locations over time The research will take place primarily at the University of North Texas, it represents substantial advancement in aDNA analysis in archaeology, and it will involve students in all phases of the project.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zlV6CZAAAAAJ,"['environmental archaeology', 'historical ecology', 'ethnobiology', 'zooarchaeology']",2688,29,15,17,14,25,43,61,63,76,103,114,123,196,201,174,233,220,231,7,11,12,254,222,202,30

The commemoration of shared heritage through the maintenance of traditional rituals and material culture is often an important means for communities ? both past and present - to maintain integration and identity.  Nevertheless, most approaches to sustainability in the past focus on environmental and demographic factors while placing little emphasis on considerations of community commemoration and cooperation. By focusing on the material realities of community life over long time frames, archaeology is especially poised to build comprehensive accounts of sustainability that consider how the challenges of social integration and environmental adaptation are entangled. How do communities adapt their traditions and maintain solidarity as they undergo major transformations in subsistence practices and political economy? How can people deploy old practices to make new forms of social organization possible? By investigating what contributed to community sustainability in the past, social scientists can better address parallel challenges in the present. In particular, this research can inform strategies of heritage maintenance among indigenous or other marginalized communities undergoing economic transformations that threaten their ways of life and continued existence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Lash and his research team will investigate how members of a small island community adapted the monuments and practices of a ritual tradition as the community underwent major transformations in agriculture, political economy, and demographics in the 18th to 20th centuries. Previous scholarship suggests that ritual practices can foster shared heritage and identity by maintaining monuments from the past as places of collective access and commemoration. From c. 1750-1960, islanders on Inishark in western Ireland visited a series of monuments as part of annual ritual processions dedicated to St Leo. Scattered around islanders? houses and field plots, these monuments were remnants of a monastery abandoned centuries earlier. To assess the impact of this ritual tradition on community sustainability, research will trace how the use, abandonment, renovation, and destruction of ritual monuments corresponds across time with transitions in village agriculture, landholding, and demographics. Combining oral history, archival documents, and excavation of four monuments will reconstruct the changing practices and spatial dynamics of the ritual tradition. Results will test common assumptions about the capacity of heritage maintenance to support political economic formations by structuring community members? movements and commemorations. A research team of American, Irish, and local collaborators will generate a dataset that will enhance archaeological analyses of sustainability and inform local initiatives that incorporate archaeological heritage as a key cultural and economic resource.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IBjzaJAAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'theory', 'medieval', 'historical']",7198,28,187,183,245,240,241,219,269,298,353,413,413,423,458,379,386,384,405,106,134,164,329,287,257,15

Addressing this question poses surprising obstacles, such as the difficulty in optimizing large-scale spaces for experimental testing and controlling for pre-existing knowledge. Desktop virtual reality offers one possible way to address this question, although such testing offers an incomplete rendition of the full-body, immersive experience that is real-world navigation. Researchers will develop a 2-D treadmill coupled with a head-mounted display to allow free ambulation of large-scale virtual spaces. Successful development of this device has important societal applications. For example, pre-training with enriched body-based cues has the potential to increase knowledge transfer to real world environments, which could be helpful for training individuals such as first-responders and navigation in wilderness environments. Also, the device and proposed experiments will provide a completely novel understanding of the neural basis of human spatial navigation with body-based cues, fundamental to accurately modeling spatial cognition and understanding why we often get lost when we visit new cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost all theories of the neural basis of spatial navigation, largely developed in freely navigating rodents, assume the critical importance of importance of body-based cues to this code. Yet the vast majority of studies in humans involve navigation in desktop virtual reality. The novel device that will be developed will permit 2-D locomotion-based VR navigation, allowing a full range of body/head rotations and ambulation. The experiments will determine 1) the contributions of body-based input to human spatial navigation and how navigation in VR with body-based can enhance subsequent knowledge of real world environments 2) how the brain codes spatial distance by employing simultaneous EEG recordings 3) how the brain codes the relative directions of landmarks in the environment by modeling the underlying multidimensional brain networks using high-resolution functional magnetic imaging (fMRI).

A general theory of memory is that sleep is important to make the memory of an experience stable and resistant to interference.

The ease with which sentences are produced has led to speculations that sentence production may not rely on executive functions such as inhibitory control. This project aims to test whether inhibitory control plays a role in grammatical production by focusing on subject-verb agreement 'attraction' errors. In English, the subject of the sentence agrees with the verb in number (e.g., ""The lion is red,"" ""The lions are red"").  Attraction errors arise when the sentence contains a second noun with a different grammatical number than the subject noun, as in ""The lion next to the birds ARE red.""  Understanding the role of inhibitory control in sentence production could provide key insights on how to evaluate and treat language impairments, as well as how to develop more effective pedagogical methods for children who produce non-adult-like syntactic structures.

For instance, we hammer using a hammer, and drink from glasses that are made of glass. These flexible uses of words provide expressive power, but seem likely to be difficult for children to learn. Hearing the same word used in multiple ways may lead to confusion and slow down the learning process.  Surprisingly, recent research suggests that flexible uses of words do not impede children from learning words, but actually appear to facilitate the process. The goal of the current project is to understand how children master flexible language so easily by studying children in structured study environments and by observing how parents and children use these words in their everyday lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve both tightly controlled experimental approaches and annotation and analysis of transcripts of parent-child speech. First, the project will explore how children are exposed to flexibility in their conversations with parents, and how this might vary across different languages. Second, the project will assess how children between 2- and 4-years old manage to learn the different meanings of flexible words, while at the same time keeping these meanings distinct in their heads. Investigators Srinivasan and Rabagliati will also conduct experiments to explore how children learn to use flexible words in creative ways that they could not have heard before. The final series of studies will examine what the consequences of flexibility are for children's cognitive development more generally. In particular, studies will explore whether the ways that flexible words are used in a language can teach children about the world more generally.

For example, when a spouse says, ""I'm pretty sure I locked the door"" do you interpret that statement as indicating that you should double check the lock or not. Interpretation of such expressions of confidence present important cognitive challenges and can be influenced by a number of different factors. The cognitive biases that can influence these interpretations of confidence and the approaches to expressing confidence that might limit the impact of these biases are important areas of research with wide-ranging applications. The current project examines these factors in the context of eyewitness identification. When an eyewitness identifies someone from a lineup and states, ""I'm pretty sure it's him,"" how do we know that police, jurors and others will interpret this expression of confidence in the way that it was intended? While a large literature exists on eyewitness confidence and (a) its relationship with identification accuracy, (b) its influence on jurors, and (c) its vulnerability to influence from post-identification feedback, very little is known about how other people understand the verbal expressions of eyewitness confidence. The outcomes of this project in terms of a more thorough understanding of the cognitive factors that influence interpretations of confidence are anticipated to have broad implications for settings, such as judicial proceedings, that involve the interpretation of another person's confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how people understand an eyewitness's verbal expression of confidence in the accuracy of his/her identification from a lineup of faces.  There are three goals:  first, the project examines how the particular content of an eyewitness's justification for his/her level of confidence (e.g., ""I'm pretty certain it's him because I remember his chin"") influences how people understand the eyewitness's confidence-statement. Second, there are a variety of cognitive biases that cause individuals to misinterpret the verbal expressions of certainty.  For example, mounting research on the 'outcome-severity bias' shows that the identical verbal probability phrase (e.g., ""it is somewhat likely"") is interpreted as denoting a higher numerical likelihood when that phrase refers to more severe events rather than less severe events.  The project considers whether eyewitness expressions of confidence are vulnerable to misunderstandings that are caused by the same kinds of cognitive biases.  Third, the proposed experiments investigate whether the harmful influence of these cognitive biases can be mitigated by expressing confidence numerically instead of verbally. Overall, the project will fill a profound lack of knowledge about how people understand eyewitness confidence in a lineup identification. Moreover, the knowledge that verbal expressions of certainty are vulnerable to misinterpretations may: (a) guide police to obtain a numerical estimate of certainty from eyewitnesses; and (b) alert police, lawyers, judges and jurors to potential pitfalls about interpreting verbal expressions of certainty.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pRDHvWYAAAAJ,['Memory'],4489,33,112,149,184,217,206,186,201,175,211,205,177,258,199,174,184,215,211,42,86,66,233,279,253,39

However, human adaptive responses to periodic fluctuations in local environment over the long term are poorly understood.  Even more crucial is understanding how humans responded to climatic change, not in the few optimal areas of the world, but rather in key marginal loci where the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and pastoralists are at stake. Archaeology is uniquely poised to answer questions such as: Why are certain types of system resilient to climate change while others fall apart? What types of strategy are adaptive not just over the short term but for millennia? Along with colleagues, Dr. Alpoim Guedes will carry out research to understand how humans modified their agricultural and pastoral strategies in the context of a series of major climatic reversals over the past two millennia. By examining the potential for different adaptive strategies at the local level and providing a long term perspective on the consequences of human decision making, this research has the potential to further the production of more diverse, and more locally-adapted food sources that are resilient in the face of climate change. In addition to serving as a field school for students from a local university, it provides an international fieldwork experience for US minority undergraduates as well as two early career scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Alpoim Guedes and colleagues will investigate how humans responded to and adapted to climatic fluctuations in one key marginal area: the high altitude environment of Eastern Himalayas of China.  In addition to reconstructing ancient subsistence patterns through the analysis of plant and animal remains, the researchers will investigate how different types of social organization facilitated or impaired human adaptation. Project researchers will develop models to predict how crop and forage grass production was impacted by climatic change. Each of these models will be used to predict how production fluctuated not only in the past but also in future predicted scenarios. By outlining the complex interactions between different factors that determine how crops and graze resources react to changes in climatic and ecological variables, the models created for this project can be applied to other high altitude/high latitude areas worldwide, particularly those in the United States.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=nKHFK5QAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'Climate Change', 'Archaeobotany', 'Earth and Planetary Science', 'Agriculture']",2585,23,,,,,,,,,,15,29,52,173,136,167,156,286,,,,461,475,525,65

Tennis players in the zone remark that the ball seems to move in slow motion.  These examples, both of which have been confirmed in experiments as a psychological reality, suggest that what a person sees may not be the true, physical state of the world but rather can be biased by action.  In the case of athletes, such misperceptions may be inherently interesting, but are unlikely to have a major impact on people's lives.  In contrast, similar errors in perception by airplane pilots of runway size, drivers of car distances, or doctors of tumor size are quite concerning.  Given the important role of vision in daily life and especially as it relates to safety, it is critical to understand the processes underlying this fundamental ability of the mind.  The research project is designed to explore when and how people's visual perception is biased by action.  In addition, the research project contributes to the education and training of several graduate students and dozens of undergraduate students.  These students are also being trained on how to work alongside scientists with opposing views through a process known as adversarial collaboration.  Although this kind of work presents its own challenges, the science is likely to benefit from such collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many important and nuanced ways that action could give rise to errors in perception.  Airport runways could appear smaller when the airline pilot is not performing well, fatigued, or hungry, or when environmental conditions are poor such as high winds or strong rainfall.  The research project examines the potential impact on vision of action-related effects due to 1) energetic demands of the task, 2) difficulty of the task, and 3) whether or not a task is even possible.  In doing so, the research project will uncover the boundaries for which perception is prone to errors explicitly caused by action.  The scientists conducting the research are considering the extent to which any effects are artifacts of the experimental setting, as opposed to genuine effects on perception that would impact how perceivers see the surrounding environment in the real world.  This is a critical step for ensuring that the studied effects will have implications for daily life.  Indeed, many of the experiments forgo traditional laboratory settings to explore how action influences perception in both real environments and in environments that simulate the real world using virtual reality.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OTURr2QAAAAJ,"['perception', 'cognitive psychology', 'action-perception coupling']",6415,38,,,29,24,42,106,115,204,268,425,456,501,531,656,552,450,452,,,,587,468,429,38

When we hold a glass of water, the forces applied by the fingers are directed against the surface of the glass, and our brain coordinates these forces to prevent slippage and maintain the orientation of the glass. The planned studies will combine computational methods derived from control engineering and robotics with techniques and theories from neuroscience to understand how the brain controls grip forces when lifting and manipulating objects and how it estimates an object's mechanical properties. The investigations will consider how grasping an object is affected by uncertainties about the object properties (e.g., it's hardness, slipperiness, texture, etc) and how fundamental manipulation skills may be enhanced by artificially augmenting tactile information. The outcomes of these studies will influence several domains including (1) neuroscience (understanding our ability to  control and manipulate objects with our hands); (2) technology (for presenting force information to users of robotic devices such as teleoperation and robot-assisted surgery); and (3) neurorehabilitation (for developing intelligent robotic prostheses and new exercises to promote the recovery of lost manual skills). These studies will establish a collaborative interaction between scientists in the United States and Israel having a range of expertise that includes robotics, control, motor systems neuroscience and neurorehabilitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting the fingers to cooperate during dexterous manipulation requires the integration of different types of information. The fingers have a rich array of tactile sensors that generate signals related to the interaction with the object. However, for the brain to know the magnitude and direction of these forces, it must also know the orientation of the fingers in space. This information is obtained by other sources that form the basis for the sense of position of the body in space. The control of grasp can also be informed by kinesthetic force sensors in the muscles that in turn are integrated with the sense of the joint's configuration in space. This project takes advantage of a new technology that allows applying controlled stretches to the skin of the fingers. Skin stretch devices mounted on a robotic manipulator will be used to apply a variety of controlled perturbations while subjects are performing manipulation tasks. Perturbations will be applied to increase or decrease the consistency between tactile and kinesthetic feedback, and to investigate how the brain adapts the ability to maintain a stable grasp during both unpredictable and predictable forces. The approach will combine theory and experiments to tackle the integration of multiple information sources in perception and in controlling manipulation and grip forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported by a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=i26AbOYAAAAJ,"['Systems Neuroscience', 'Motor Learning', 'Robotics', 'Rehabilitation', 'Computational Neuroscience']",19766,60,534,616,646,722,715,771,765,819,793,909,874,846,907,848,762,767,787,445,401,493,752,729,658,86

Migration happens at a range of spatial scales, may involve temporary or permanent relocation, occurs in multiple directions, and is undertaken for a variety of reasons that involve pull factors, such as the promise of abundant resources or religious freedom, and push factors, like escaping an oppressive regime or culture of violence. In such contexts, people may choose to flaunt the distinctive and highly visible markers of their identity or opt to mask their identity by emulating or mimicking the material culture of their neighbors, and each strategy has different implications for the successful integration of community members. Many of the less visible attributes of material culture, especially those that are the product of motor skills learned early in life are not easily changed and therefore are strong indicators of cultural origin. Sissel Schroeder will investigate both the high visibility and low visibility attributes of material culture and their spatial distribution at a Mississippian town that formed through population coalescence and rose to prominence in the midcontinent of North America in the 13th century AD, a time of considerable population movement across North America. Gaining insights into how a multi-cultural community forms, is successful for multiple generations, and dissolves has implications for global issues of ethnic unrest in the world today. Undergraduate and graduate students who participate in the project will gain practical hands-on training in archaeological laboratory methods, material culture identification, and curatorial best practices, as well as organizational and analytical skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the investigation of low visibility attributes, like the directional twist of the fibers used to make cordage and the kinds of clay and temper materials mixed with the clay to make pottery, it will be possible to identify learning communities of people from diverse backgrounds; by also incorporating some high visibility attributes, it will be possible to more fully explore the role of material culture in the constitution and transformation of cultural identity. The research will be conducted on existing archaeological collections that have been curated since the 1940s, thereby enhancing the value of these irreplaceable materials, promoting the importance of archaeological curation, and significantly augmenting basic understanding of the social complexity of an individual community. Dr. Schroeder will apply a novel investigative approach to the study of fabric. Since fabric rarely preserves in the humid Eastern Woodlands, archaeologists are restricted to studying it through impressions left on the exterior of ceramic vessels.

In other words, comprehension precedes production. The present research investigates the cognitive processes used for language comprehension and production and whether they are sensitive to a person's prior experience with the language or with particular words. The investigators will also explore whether the way adults learn words presented on their own (as often occurs in language classes) generalizes to everyday language experience (i.e., reading prose, listening to natural speech, and producing natural speech). The research will allow the investigators to determine the cognitive processes that overlap for reading, listening to speech, and producing speech and to assess the durability of memory after these different language experiences. The research activities will increase diversity in research training and participation by including research assistants and research participants from ethnic minority groups in a region with low education and income levels. The research may also have educational implications for vocabulary development of second language learners, both in terms of study techniques for students and teaching practices for educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project links implicit memory, lexical access, and vocabulary development in controlled experiments with English speakers and Spanish-English bilingual speakers. Word comprehension and production processes are typically investigated separately.  In contrast, the present study explores the impact of comprehension exposures on later production, using a repetition-priming procedure. The first overarching goal is to reveal the nature and durability of memory traces left by auditory and visual comprehension exposures to words as indexed by their impact on later spoken production. Second, the project aims to determine whether patterns of learning elicited by isolated words also result from words seen or heard in sentence contexts. Third, the research addresses fundamental questions about lexical processing that have been debated in the literature, for example, whether comprehension and production processes involve access to common phonological word-form representations, whether comprehension and production involve access to both modality-general and modality-specific representations, and what stages of word production are impacted by experiential variables such as word frequency and language proficiency.

An individual's working memory functioning is strongly and positively related to important outcomes such as intelligence, reading comprehension, mathematic proficiency, and resistance to distraction. An important question is what specific cognitive processes can explain why working memory is so critical for these diverse aspects of behavior. A related question is whether increasing a person's working memory functioning via computerized memory exercises will lead to improvements not just in working memory but also in related outcomes, such as intelligence and reading comprehension. This research project will provide the foundation for new theoretical perspectives about working memory that have the potential to drastically alter the future of cognitive training research and commercialization. The information gained via this project comes at a critical juncture, as the public, K-12, and medical use of computerized cognitive training is increasing, along with recent estimates of billions of US dollars spent on such computerized training. The investigators will provide workshops and lectures to students, faculty, community members, and K-12 teachers and administrators, both in-person and via Internet-based materials.

This approach differs from the typical one-size-fits-all method of cognitive training that does not consider the individual's particular cognitive profile. Before and after training, participants will complete various cognitive tests designed to assess whether the training leads to very specific improvements (i.e., outcomes similar to the training program) or broader improvements (i.e., intelligence, reading comprehension).

A major question is how people attend to the information that is most relevant to their current goals and ignore distracting, irrelevant information. One strategy is that people focus their attention on specific properties of objects, such as their color, shape, or location.  However, previous research has shown that people do not always control their attention in an optimal way.  Additionally, little is known about the factors motivating how people choose to control their attention. The current project will investigate the role of three factors that may influence how attention is controlled: 1) performance maximization (the drive to achieve a goal as quickly as possible); 2) effort minimization (avoiding tasks that are cognitively taxing); and 3) novelty-seeking (exploring new stimuli in the environment). Using a new method to measure all three of these factors, the research team will establish each individual's unique ""Attention Control Profile."" Providing a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of an individual's attentional control strategies may have important implications for screening and training employees in professions that depend heavily on attentional control, such as drivers, security agents, and air traffic controllers. The Attention Control Profile may also be helpful for assessing attentional control deficits in special populations, such as individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, or damage to frontal or parietal brain regions. In addition to the broader scientific contributions, this project will provide training to undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers at The Ohio State University, with an emphasis on including women and members from groups underrepresented in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a combination of behavioral and eye-tracking measures to develop an Attention Control Profile for each participating individual, using a new visual search task that is designed to reproduce essential aspects of real-world search. The task allows individuals to choose freely among multiple different attentional control strategies, in order to find one of multiple possible search targets.  Additionally, the task features a search display that varies continuously over time, which will prompt individuals to adjust their control strategies dynamically. The investigators will explore how effectively individuals choose search targets, adapt their control strategies to the changing environment, and ignore irrelevant information. This will, in turn, provide a metric for how much each individual's attentional control is influenced by performance maximization, effort minimization and novelty-seeking. The project also explores the underlying sources of individual variation in attentional control, by examining whether an individual's strategy depends on motivational state (e.g., when fast performance receives high rewards) or specific personality traits (e.g., impulsivity or deliberateness). These methods will enable the researchers to provide a tool for measuring individualized attentional control profiles and will help unpack the motivations underlying the use of different attentional control strategies.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BK2QYYcAAAAJ,"['Attention', 'Cognitive Control', 'human behavior', 'fMRI']",3567,24,16,25,79,73,106,129,178,146,159,201,193,190,221,149,203,258,254,,,,290,292,316,39

Rapid social and economic change offer many new opportunities that are of possible benefit to individuals. However, adopting new modes of social organization and ways of making a living are also risky because traditional knowledge may be inadequate when evaluating the costs and benefits of pursuing unfamiliar behaviors. This situation is widespread in many societies encountering new markets. This process, which is currently poorly understood, is of particular importance because social and wealth inequality emerge as a result of market access. Thus, here we seek to learn, when novel opportunities are introduced, why are some individuals and families better able to take advantage of the situation, while others try and fail or continue to rely on traditional and conservative lifeways?  The negative impact of income inequality is of growing concern both in both the popular press and academic literature because of its associations with quality of life indicators, including patterns of health, education and aging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer the question of how inequality emerges within a group of people, and to address broader concerns regarding its negative impacts, University of Utah researchers Drs. Karen L. Kramer and Ryan Schacht will work with a group of rural Maya. This study population provides an ideal opportunity to explore the emergence and consequences of inequality for two key reasons: 1) the Maya have only recently had regular access to wage labor and economic markets and are just beginning to show signs of inequality in wealth, health, and education; 2) working with the Maya helps the researchers to account for many of the confounding factors that confuse a clear interpretation of associations between inequality and negative outcomes in the West. The researchers will test the hypothesis that risk orientation is a key determinant for the emergence of inequality. The central prediction is that preexisting variation in kin and non-kin network size affects risk orientation and subsequently facilitates the differential accumulation of wealth (land, consumer goods, cash, education, health) by some more than others. The project integrates a network and risk sensitivity approach to study decision-making under diversifying socioeconomic conditions. Their research findings will offer insight not only to the consequences looming for many small-scale societies currently undergoing economic and wealth transitions, but also to industrialized populations experiencing ever increasing levels of wealth inequality.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2tP1330AAAAJ,"['Evolutionary anthropology', 'cooperative breeding', 'demography', 'life history theory', 'hunter-gatherers']",5241,36,31,19,29,48,57,143,149,180,176,145,189,234,288,349,421,408,385,,,,569,544,668,63

These questions will be investigated in Amapa, a town founded by black slaves escaping plantation slavery during Mexico's late colonial in 1769. In the Americas, including the United States, maroon communities have been characterized as existing in obscured and marginal places such as swamps or mountains. This research, however, focuses on a town that was not consigned to geographic backwoods, but that was legally founded by black runaway slaves, or maroons, with the approval of colonial officials. Despite their legal and spatial relocation, however, the Amapa settlers were nonetheless perceived as maroons by others and depicted in a hostile light. The process of incorporating the maroonsinto colonial society rested on the assumption that they were capable of becoming docile colonial subjects. Towns, in effect, were the cornerstones of colonial civility. Paradoxically, the Amapa maroons continued to be portrayed as savages"" unworthy, and perhaps incapable, of ""civilization"". What has not been examined is how the process of colonial incorporation was realized in the everyday experiences of Amapa residents. This research is of broader relevance because it provides a context and comparative case for understanding problems of perception of minorities and their incorporation into a multi-ethinc societies such as that which exist in the United States today. Similar processes are also occurring currently in many other regions of the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue will be explored through a combination of archaeological investigations, artifact analysis, and archaeometric work. Excavated materials from Amapa will be compared to information recorded in colonial documents about the maroons' social and material practices both prior to and after their resettlement. Specifically, this project will focus on four categories of evidence: a) settlement space, b) food acquisition, preparation, and consumption, c) artifact use, and d) circulations of regional ceramics through archaeometric analysis. The latter will examine the chemical content of selected materials to track the provenance and movement of pottery. In addition to contributing original, scientific data to maroon studies and Mexican colonial history, the proposed project will involve the present-day Amapa community in all steps of the research design, fieldwork, and interpretation.

An individual's working memory functioning is strongly and positively related to important outcomes such as intelligence, reading comprehension, mathematic proficiency, and resistance to distraction. An important question is what specific cognitive processes can explain why working memory is so critical for these diverse aspects of behavior. A related question is whether increasing a person's working memory functioning via computerized memory exercises will lead to improvements not just in working memory but also in related outcomes, such as intelligence and reading comprehension. This research project will provide the foundation for new theoretical perspectives about working memory that have the potential to drastically alter the future of cognitive training research and commercialization. The information gained via this project comes at a critical juncture, as the public, K-12, and medical use of computerized cognitive training is increasing, along with recent estimates of billions of US dollars spent on such computerized training. The investigators will provide workshops and lectures to students, faculty, community members, and K-12 teachers and administrators, both in-person and via Internet-based materials. In addition, the project will provide a variety of hands-on research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate a novel approach to cognitive training, by first identifying specific working memory strengths and weaknesses in a large sample of young adults, and then developing specific cognitive training exercises that target an individual's working memory functioning. This approach differs from the typical one-size-fits-all method of cognitive training that does not consider the individual's particular cognitive profile. Before and after training, participants will complete various cognitive tests designed to assess whether the training leads to very specific improvements (i.e., outcomes similar to the training program) or broader improvements (i.e., intelligence, reading comprehension).

This increase in urban living comes with many benefits: sustainable spaces for living, increased flow of ideas and innovation, better proximity to services, and diverse communities. Unfortunately, urban life as it stands is also associated with increased stress, worse physical and mental health, and shorter life expectancy. All of these negative effects alter our physiology, brain, and behavior. By understanding the psychological, neural, and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between exposure to nature and cognitive performance, future studies will be able to more easily implement interventions aimed at improving built spaces in order to enhance the potential for human productivity and vitality. This research is guided by Attention Restoration Theory, which posits that incorporating natural elements into the built environment can counteract some of the negatives of urban life. Results from this proposal could be used to help design schools, offices, homes, cities and towns to optimize human functioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Philosophers, writers, and lay people have had the intuition for centuries that interacting with nature has myriad benefits to human functioning. While this intuition is appealing, it needs rigorous testing. This project aims to identify the mechanisms through which interactions with natural environments might enhance both behavior and brain function, using cutting edge neuroscience, psychophysiological and machine-learning tools. The primary objectives of this research project are the following. First the research will examine the psychological, physiological, and neural processes that are altered during interactions with natural environments. It will address questions such as how hard must the brain work when processing more natural vs. more urban stimuli, and how does this processing affect people's ability to focus. Second, the research will determine some of the characteristics (e.g., low-level visual features such as color, edge content, fractalness, etc.) of natural and urban environments that lead to psychological improvements or decrements. This information will aid understanding of some of the visual features that may be producing these benefits, which could then be used to help design new built spaces or retrofit existing built spaces. Third, the research will test whether individuals who are in more mentally fatigued states will benefit more from natural vs. urban environment exposure. This aspect of the work will help to define the neural and psychophysiological basis of mental fatigue. In summary, this research project aims to understand how interactions with different environments affect human functioning, and what interventions can be made to improve human functioning at large scales.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zCT_0OQAAAAJ,"['Environmental Neuroscience', 'fMRI', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Affective Neuroscience', 'Environmental Psychology']",18272,49,,,,,,100,194,316,471,721,871,906,1135,1292,1325,1626,1752,,,,2120,2292,2360,206

For example, understanding how well you know a new vocabulary word allows you to decide when to stop studying words as they are learned.  Metacognition involves both monitoring one's own ongoing cognitive processes and exerting cognitive control over them. The proposed research is significant because it will identify the role of cognitive monitoring and control in complex nonhuman primate cognition. This comparative research will advance knowledge of the evolution of complex cognition and of what makes humans unique. The investigators will promote public education about cognitive science and primate cognition through visits to K-12 classrooms and developing an interactive kiosk at the local zoo that allows visitors to experience the same cognitive tests performed by the primates on exhibit. Throughout the research project, undergraduate and graduate students will receive training for careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evidence from psychophysical and memory tests indicates that nonhuman primates introspectively monitor some cognitive processes, for example showing selective avoidance of difficult tests. This research will determine the role of cognitive monitoring for cognitive control in primates by examining which cognitive systems are accessible to cognitive monitoring and which are not. Cognitive systems accessible to cognitive monitoring will be distinguished from those that are not by testing for dissociations between accuracy and confidence in tasks involving multiple memory systems contributing to accuracy, and by using psychophysical tests that dissociate motor and perceptual processes. Specific studies address these goals through consideration of 1) the extent to which primates regulate the amount of information they acquire prior to taking tests; 2) what information primates monitor when making metacognitive judgments; 3) the extent to which primates strategically exercise cognitive control only when necessary and adaptively allocate monitoring among competing tasks; and 4) the role of language-like mental representations in cognitive monitoring and control.

About fourteen thousand years ago, ancestral Native Americans first entered the Great Basin of North America, where they encountered a landscape dominated by large inland lakes and marshes. Although the climate was generally cooler and wetter than today, it was highly variable and experienced dramatic shifts associated with the transition from the Pleistocene to Holocene epochs. Nonetheless, early Native Americans developed a stable adaptation, characterized by a flexible technology and subsistence base, and high mobility that persevered over the ensuing six millennia, but dramatically reorganized with the onset of extreme aridity about 8,000 years ago.

Providing audiovisual information about speech, not just audio information alone, has also been shown to help infants develop language. In some cases, using audiovisual information to train speech perception helps adults learn a second language, helps aphasic patients produce more fluent speech, and improves perception of heard speech by listeners with hearing impairments. This last group is of particular interest because roughly a third of U.S. adults have some degree of hearing impairment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this audiovisual training advantage is well established, it is unclear how exactly the effect works. Research will be conducted to determine the principles behind the effect, how and why it works, and in what circumstances. The investigators also explore why audiovisual training typically does not help hearing-impaired individuals who received cochlear implants after early childhood. One possibility is that their years of experience before receiving the cochlear implant required a heavy reliance on lip reading, leaving them over-reliant on information from the talker during audiovisual training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific issues examined are rooted in theories of multisensory learning. These issues include: a) whether simultaneous auditory and visual speech is necessary for the training advantage to occur; b) to what degree the advantage generalizes across different talkers for a given listener; and c) whether the use of other sensory channels, in this case audio and touch, results in a similar training advantage. Parallel experiments will be carried out with both normal-hearing individuals and individuals who received cochlear implants after early childhood. The research should not only improve speech perception training regimes for individuals in this clinical population but should also improve our understanding of typical speech and talker perception.

The human mind has evolved a capacity to continually self-monitor, checking ongoing performance against goals, maintaining alertness to possible errors, and rapidly adjusting attention when performance shows signs of slipping. The present research project will investigate the processes by which performance errors are detected, leading to heightened physiological arousal and adaptive changes in cognition that momentarily refocus attention on task-relevant information in the environment. Using both EEG measures of brain activity and measures of pupil diameter to quantify physiological arousal, the research will test the hypothesis that arousal elicited by performance errors leads to enhanced attention. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will strengthen the research environment in cognitive neuroscience at a highly selective liberal arts college that sends disproportionate numbers of graduates on to doctoral-level research in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective control of cognitive performance depends on noticing and responding to performance errors in ways that are behaviorally adaptive. The proposed research tests a novel model of error-reactivity that focuses on error-related alpha suppression (ERAS), which refers to the reduction in EEG alpha-band activity in the inter-trial interval following an error compared to a correct response. The model posits that ERAS reflects transient arousal resulting from norepinephrine projections that ascend from the brainstem locus coerulus to activate cortical regions in response to salient events. The arousal model predicts that ERAS should covary with error-related pupil dilation, which is mediated by the norepinephrine system. In addition, based on adaptive gain theory, the model predicts that error-related arousal leads to enhanced attention to task-relevant cues, which will be measured both behaviorally and with EEG measures. Finally, using current time-frequency analysis techniques, the research will directly compare ERAS to other error-related oscillatory phenomena that are present in different EEG frequency bands (i.e., error-related theta and gamma effects). Results will provide novel information to inform theories of error-related cognitive control by detailing how performance mistakes lead to momentary arousal responses and by examining the relationship between error-related arousal and behavioral performance.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OsGdCtwAAAAJ,"['art history', 'Renaissance', 'Venus', 'pigments', 'Camaldoli']",14,3,,,,,,,,,,1,1,3,1,2,1,1,2,,,,2,,,

Stigma remains one of the foremost barriers to effective HIV prevention, treatment and retention in care. HIV stigma undermines HIV prevention efforts by making it difficult for people to get tested for HIV, reduce their risk of infection, as well as seek and remain in care, if they are living with HIV. As a result, scholarly attention has centered on continuing refinement and conceptualization of stigma.  Contemporary approaches to HIV-related stigma recognize the role of individual characteristics (such as their level of education, understanding of HIV, risk behaviors, etc.) and their social environments in shaping stigma and its experiences. However, stigma by definition is a byproduct of interpersonal relationships or an individual's social networks. An individual's relationships - whom they know, to whom they talk, in whom they confide, in fact, their social capital - are just as important in determining their propensity to stigmatize and be stigmatized. Unfortunately, scant attention has been paid to analyzing how stigma is shaped by the characteristics of the social networks of those enacting stigma and their targets. Insights from the project's findings will inform HIV prevention policies and programs as well as anti-stigma interventions and efforts to increase HIV testing and retention in care. The project also broadens participation of underrepresented groups in science, and trains undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Emmanuel Koku of Drexel University will examine the effects of stigma and social capital on two health outcomes: getting tested for and adherence to HIV treatment. He and his research team will interview and conduct a social network survey with over 300 African immigrants (one of the fastest growing groups of migrants to the United States, and one that is increasingly at risk of HIV infection) in the greater Philadelphia area. They will (i) explore how HIV and its stigma is constructed, understood, and assigned in African immigrant communities, (2) document the experiences of stigma within the community, (3) analyze the influence of social networks and interpersonal relationships on experiences of stigma, HIV testing and adherence to care. Through these efforts, the proposed research will contribute to conceptualizations of stigma by linking it to social network theories, particularly social capital. The project's conceptual approach departs from dominant methodologies that view social capital as positive, evident in community norms of trust, reciprocity, and civic engagement.

For example, when an observer focuses their attention on a single object, such as a friend at a crowded party, this can lead to an almost complete filtering of the background. Because of its early and important role in cognitive neuroscience, attention research has remained central to our study of the brain. Recent experiments have suggested that the role of attention is more ubiquitous to brain function than originally appreciated, playing a key role in other domains such as decision-making, executive control, and social interaction. The field of attention research has grown and diversified over the past 20 years, but there has not been a corresponding increase in communication among major thinkers. The goal of this conference is to therefore bring together a diverse group of scholars who study attention and related areas, who take unique, creative, and future-oriented approaches to the problem. Key foci for the meeting will be new multivariate techniques for analysis of neural data, naturalistic behaviors including foraging and social attention, the relationship between attention and learning, and exploration of attention in diverse systems, including babies and patient populations. The meeting will lay out an agenda for the next 20 or 25 years of research in attention and related fields.

How the United States responds to such crises is both a major humanitarian concern and a policy concern for the 21st century. Migration under duress has multiple, often interacting,  consequences. Some, such as economic and cultural disruption are evident; others, such as long-term biological effects, unfold more subtly over time. The overarching research goal of this project is to understand one of those long-term effects, the impact of migration on female fertility. Moving to a new region might impact fertility directly given the physiological costs of long distance movement, but also indirectly, as the costs and benefits of reproduction change. This is an understudied question that is of interest to policy makers concerned with migrant welfare; scholars who seek to understand the connections between human experience and human biology; and the migrants themselves as they seek to establish new lives under difficult conditions. The research will be conducted by Dr. Mary Towner (Oklahoma State University) and Dr. Kermyt Anderson (University of Oklahoma). The problem requires longitudinal data, so they will use historical demographic data that are available for American Indians  in Oklahoma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between 1828 and 1887, tens of thousands of American Indians with diverse cultural histories migrated to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) under United States government removal policies. It is well-known that they incurred significant economic and social costs, including loss of resources and high morbidity and mortality. Little is known, though, about how female fertility was affected. The overarching research goal of this project is to understand the impact of migration, access to resources, and ethnicity on fertility variation across American Indian women in historical Oklahoma. Ethnicity captures diverse cultural traditions, social norms, and population history. Fertility contrasts between ethnic groups may be particularly acute when migration brings people of different ethnicities together and as ethnic groups experience differential access to resources. To meet the project goal, the researchers will use a three-leveled methodological approach: 1) a cross-sectional sample of Oklahoma women drawn from the 1910 United States Federal Census, 2) a longitudinal database of women, reconstructed from historical records, and 3) cross-cultural ethnographies to assemble information on Oklahoma tribes. Together, these complementary levels of data and analysis will be brought to bear on predictions stemming from three specific research questions. Research Question 1: What was the extent of fertility variation in early Oklahoma and how was it patterned across women? Research Question 2: What was the long-term impact of migration and relocation on fertility? Research Question 3: How did cultural history shape fertility at the population level? The findings of this project will be informative to both scholars and policy-makers working on questions of fertility, migration, and ethnicity, as well as those with a particular interest in American Indian populations.  The project will also benefit society by supporting graduate student training and providing undergraduates--including American Indian students--an opportunity to engage in STEM research.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=05MiYk0AAAAJ,"['historical demography', 'human behavioral ecology', 'evolutionary anthropology']",912,14,15,11,36,25,26,33,23,32,18,37,43,39,77,49,41,61,47,10,9,10,78,74,82,7

The Annual Meeting of OHBM is regarded as the premier venue for the integration of innovative brain imaging methods and cognitive neuroscience, and has emerged to address the need of the brain-mapping scientific community for a forum to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging-based methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-one highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2016 Annual Meeting to be held in Geneva, Switzerland. Travel awards will be given to the 25 students with the highest-ranked abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low.  In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively very high.  Hence, the ability to work in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience.

Presently, about 9% of the population is aged 70 years or older. This proportion will have grown to around 15% by 2030, bringing with it a dramatic increase in the economic and social costs of age-related cognitive and physical impairment, and fuelling an urgent need for research in aging. Advancing age is associated with an accelerating trajectory of decline in several important cognitive abilities, including episodic memory, the ability to accurately recollect the details of a recent event. Importantly, age-related decline in memory accuracy is not always accompanied by a decline in memory confidence, the strength of our conviction that a memory is accurate. This increases their risk of basing important choices and decisions on erroneous information. The present research aims to understand why a mismatch between the feeling that a memory is accurate and its actual accuracy is more common in older than in younger people. The findings will shed new light on why older people are prone to make inaccurate, confident memory judgments and will contribute to the development of interventions that ameliorate this tendency. The research will also provide training in the cognitive neuroscience of aging for masters and PhD students, and for postdoctoral trainees. An important additional broader impact will be the contribution of the research to the outreach and education activities of the Center for Vital Longevity at the University of Texas at Dallas. These activities include frequent talks on age-related research by Center members (including trainees) to a wide range of community organizations, public lectures, and a biennial international scientific conference.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor the brain activity of older (65-75 yrs.) and younger (aged 18-30 yrs.) people. The research is motivated by findings that although accuracy of episodic memory is highly age-sensitive, the subjective experience of remembering is less affected. Thus, older individuals are more likely to report a strong sense of recollection in concert with an inaccurate memory judgment than are young individuals. We will examine two possible accounts of this age-related dissociation between 'objective' and 'subjective' measures of episodic memory. The first account proposes that the dissociation reflects age differences in the 'precision' of recollection. Experiment 1 will assess this account by using multi-voxel pattern analyses to examine whether the fidelity with which information about a study event is 'reinstated' in the cerebral cortex is lower in older people. The second account proposes that older individuals are as capable of recollecting detailed information as young individuals, but are less able to control recollection so as to align its content with the goal of the retrieval attempt.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ONum1r4AAAAJ,['Cognitive neuroscience of memory and aging'],52028,116,1491,1844,2007,1988,2145,2305,2234,2310,2582,2428,2241,2548,2164,2144,1993,2315,2295,873,1038,1347,2202,2281,1962,220

The research will provide new insights into the causality and spatio-temporal relationships of Dutch elm disease spread as well as the broader dispersal of forest pests and diseases throughout America's countryside and urban environments.  The findings will be particularly relevant for a better understanding of the biogeography of invasive species and invasions as well as the impacts of human interactions with forests and urban environments.  The research has significant broader implications for forest managers and public policy with regard to adopting proactive and effective mechanisms for the control of other current and future tree diseases and pests.  The doctoral student will work with government agencies and nongovernmental organizations at the local, state, and national levels to disseminate the findings.

The popularity of elm trees, however, was severely impacted by Dutch elm disease which was introduced in the United States during the early 1930s.  Over the next four decades the disease spread until elms were effectively removed from urban environments.  The doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported by this award will focus on three core questions:  (1) After its introduction to the United States, what were the spatio-temporal extents of Dutch elm disease spread? (2) What were the primary management methods used in an attempt to control Dutch elm disease, how did they change over time, where were they implemented, and why did they vary in success and failure? (3) How did Dutch elm disease affect urban landscapes in the United States?  The researchers will combine archival data and mapping software in a Historic Geographic Information Systems to visualize, map and analyze the spread of Dutch elm disease particularly in relation to the policies used to control it at both a national scale and at the local scale via a case study of Syracuse, NY.

The project focuses on the Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) 闂?15-112, which is the basis for elimination and alteration of ethnic studies courses in Arizona public and charter high schools. The ban focuses on specific courses, despite research showing how those courses are central to student success. Debates surrounding such courses reflect concerns about the U.S.-Mexico border, migration, and what constitutes American culture. Project investigators inquire into the process by which school classrooms and specific types of school curricula shape national identity, citizenship practices, and educational outcomes. The project focuses on the role of education among underrepresented groups to foster inclusion and national identity, and is directed and conducted by individuals who are underrepresented in STEM fields. The data will be disseminated through conference presentations and publications, reports to participants and through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. Ethnic studies courses are currently a topic of similar debate in other states, and an analysis of the impacts of the ethnic studies ban in Arizona is likely to inform decisions made elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the following questions: 1) How do high school classrooms function as political spaces, and what are the associated educational outcomes? 2) Does the ban promote a form of whitened citizenship in the United States? If so, how? 3) What are the processes of citizen-subject formation available to teachers and high school students in this context? The project's intellectual merit derives from new disciplinary engagements with the geographies of young people and the role of the school as both a system and a space in constructing and producing the citizen. Until recently social science research on minors emphasized parenting and behavioral studies, and largely ignored the political context of minors. This project addresses the distinctness of political spaces inhabited by teenagers and how they are engaged in the process of citizen formation.

In recent years a mysterious and severe form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) has emerged in several agricultural communities around the world. Those affected are predominantly young and middle aged male agricultural workers who do not suffer from the risk factors typically associated with kidney disease. While the exact cause of CKDu is still a source of scientific uncertainty, narratives that link the disease to the agrarian landscape have captivated popular imagination and influence farmers' cultivation practices, albeit in uneven, haphazard, and poorly understood ways. This project builds upon political ecology of health and science and technology studies (STS) to investigate how uncertainty about the cause of CKDu shapes health-environment interactions and agrarian landscapes and livelihoods. In doing so, it will account for the complex ways that farmers perceive and act on agricultural health risks while illuminating how contested understandings of environmental illnesses can fundamentally restructure agricultural practices, systems of production, and relations of expertise. Through this analysis, the proposed research will contribute directly to the development of policies and programs that facilitate agrarian livelihoods in the context of disease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the first reports of the emergence of a new form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) in the early 1990s, Sri Lanka's once peripheral dry zone has become the epicenter of an epidemic that is slowly crippling agricultural communities across the island's rice belt. The proposed project focuses on three dimensions of the relationship between CKDu and agricultural practices to explain how this scientifically contested illness is remade into an agricultural problem, and with what effects. First, the project investigates how ideas about the environment and its links to disease are formed, reinforced, and circulated. Second, it evaluates how farmers' cultivation practices are changing in response to the problem of CKDu and documents their shifts to native rice varieties and also to organic - or chemical free - systems of production, albeit in spatially uneven and sometimes transitory ways. Additionally, this study investigates how uncertainty about CKDu's cause mediates farmers' interactions with the environment and shapes the uneven adoption of native seeds as disease management strategies. Finally, the project examines how relationships between health and agricultural modernization in the dry zone have changed over time and inform contemporary agrarian shifts in response to CKDu. The project integrates archival research, ethnographic methods, and household surveys to study two dry zone farming communities. Findings of this research will provide insights into how contested agri-environmental-health problems shape practices of disease management and give rise to new forms of agricultural production. While this research is anchored in an analysis of shifting agrarian livelihoods in CKDu endemic areas of Sri Lanka, its findings will be applicable to other geographic regions where parallel epidemics of mystery kidney disease are found in agricultural communities such as India, Egypt, and Central America.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rVnsI-wAAAAJ,"['conservation', 'development', 'health-environment', 'justice', 'Africa']",1659,22,5,4,5,15,9,19,39,42,53,71,84,79,115,109,140,123,130,,,,193,194,188,13

Archaeology is particularly well suited for addressing issues of colonialism because artifacts can often provide visibility to members of society who may not be easily recognized in historical documents, such as low-status or subjugated peoples.  While previous scholarship viewed colonialism in the context of indigenous groups adopting the culture of the colonizers, more recently they are viewed as unique contested locations where both colonizing and indigenous groups influence each other culturally through a complex exchange of ideas, traditions, and material culture.  This project fills an important research gap by focusing on multiple socioeconomic within empires and how complex social interactions between colonists and local groups were manifested in the past.  This research has particular relevance for the negotiation of cultural differences in regions today where dissimilar ethnic groups come into contact as a result of population movement due to conflict, politics, or economic opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One form of archaeological material that provides an excellent medium for examining culture contact is cuisine.  The study of ancient food practices within colonial contexts will shed light on how imperial colonists and indigenous groups modified or reaffirmed their food preferences and identities within borderlands.  The research will be conducted in the central highlands of the Peru focusing on two sites from ancient Wari Empire and an indigenous site located near one of the Wari colonies.  The Wari Empire expanded to cover much of modern-day Peru and incorporated a number of ethnic groups into its administration, yet there are no written records to understand who these people were.  As a result, the carbonized plant data from these sites will be compared to determine the cuisine of Wari colonists and indigenous groups and examine the exchange of food preferences, production, and processing strategies between Wari colonists and indigenous peoples to identify how these different groups interacted and experienced colonization.  The food preferences of colonial and indigenous groups will be reconstructed and compared through correlations between architectural space, material culture, and ancient plant remains using plant remains to highlight the ways in which these groups shared their cuisine, which will allow for a more dynamic view of colonialism in the past.

For example, people often practice one variation of a skill over and over again, whereas practicing different variations of the skill mixed together leads to much better retention. This project will examine how this intermixed practice may be beneficial to skill learning that can generalize to new similar skills, and will investigate how to best practice a skill to support such transfer. Participants in these studies will learn simple finger tapping skills, similar to what one learns while playing piano or typing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to examine brain areas that are more active when people are practicing in a way that leads to better generalization to similar skills. This information will be used to improve skill learning using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which involves applying low levels of current to brain regions from the surface of the scalp. People will learn motor skills while receiving this stimulation to see if it improves their ability to later learn a new, similar skill. The findings from these studies may reveal important ways to enhance skill learning by improving the way we practice and enhancing brain activity to make people better at skill learning. As tDCS is a new, inexpensive and essentially risk-free treatment, the results here could be applied quite broadly. Given the importance of effective skill training to industry, the military, and daily life, what is learned from these studies could have a broad benefit to society by making skill training more efficient. This research will also impact education by supporting a graduate student who will learn neuroimaging and brain stimulation methods. The project will support research experiences for undergraduates drawn from the diverse population at UCLA and will make links with the community through the researchers involvement with programs designed to inspire local high school and elementary students to consider careers in life science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand how to engage the brain regions during learning that lead to the ability to transfer to new related skills. Subjects will practice a set of simple motor sequences using the serial reaction time task (SRTT) and will be tested on their ability to efficiently perform new sequences. We hypothesize that practicing multiple related motor skills in an interleaved manner will enhance transfer and engage different brain regions compared to when practicing these skills in a blocked manner, with the latter leading to interference between skills.  In this study, subjects will practice interleaved sequences in the SSRTT in an fMRI scanner, and regions will be identified in which BOLD signal during learning is correlated with subsequent transfer across subjects. In this way, the components of the motor learning system can be identified that are involved in the formation of a memory trace that can support transfer. Pilot work has identified the cerebellum as a likely target, and in the final proposed study, tDCS will be used to stimulate cerebellum during SSRTT practice and subsequent transfer to new sequences. If it can be understood how interleaved practice leads to the creation of a memory trace that leads to better transfer, it would provide key insights into neural representations of memory.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a508bl0AAAAJ,['Cognitive Neuroscience'],30574,66,628,863,952,1009,1291,1131,1283,1379,1632,1718,1596,1605,1551,1522,1501,1539,1501,418,490,622,1346,1401,1216,165

The long-term consequences of these trends remain poorly understood because of the sampling limitations of traditional field-based methods.  This project will use innovative methods that combine acoustic and LiDAR remote sensing with field-based and satellite observations in order to characterize degradation impacts over previously unavailable spatial and temporal scales. The synergy between LiDAR and acoustic remote sensing has the transformative potential to revamp the way biodiversity is monitored by facilitating simultaneous multiple sampling over extended temporal periods.  Outcomes from this research project will be useful in providing a more holistic understanding of the rapidly changing dynamics of tropical forests that will help meet the global challenges of reducing biomass and biodiversity degradation.  The project includes a strong educational component that will facilitate the transfer of key computational and remote sensing skills to undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students through an apprenticeship program initiated by the doctoral student.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Amazon Basin of Brazil, one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world, forests have been heavily altered by over four decades of deforestation for agriculture, fire and logging activities.  Understanding the impacts to biodiversity from forest degradation and the long-term habitat suitability of degraded forests is critical for efforts to reduce or minimize further damage to these environmentally sensitive areas.  The doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported by this award will focus on three core questions:  (1) How does fire and logging impact carbon stocks and habitat structure?  (2) What are the magnitudes of carbon losses and trajectories of carbon recovery following logging and fire activities?  (3) How do avian communities respond to fire and logging, and what can be inferred about the biodiversity benefits of avoided degradation?  The student will answer these questions by analyzing a time-series of satellite imagery to reconstruct the history of forest degradation and recovery that are reflected in contemporary LiDAR, forest inventory data, and bioacoustic recordings.  She will integrate acoustic signal processing and Bayesian hierarchical occupancy modeling to characterize the distribution of biomass and biodiversity across the impacted forested areas.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=PIxCJcMAAAAJ,"['Remote Sensing', 'Terrestrial Carbon Cycle', 'Biodiversity']",21614,73,210,300,321,358,466,424,516,646,778,883,990,1225,1306,1193,1361,1488,1413,153,171,213,1834,1969,2298,288

Recent animal research suggests that dopamine function, namely how dopamine neuron influence brain activity, is more diverse than previously thought.  These animal studies show that the diverse function of dopamine does not come just from the existence of different types of dopamine neurons; instead, it comes from variation in the anatomical structure of the dopamine system in the brain.  Different dopamine pathways support different cognitive processes and behaviors, such as reward and punishment, which is significant because such pathways are large enough to study with non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  This project will use MRI in human participants to achieve two goals: (1) to map dopamine pathways in the human brain and (2) to measure activity from brain regions where dopamine neurons are and brain regions that receive dopamine input. This research is important because it employs non-invasive neuroimaging methods in humans to test and expand ideas from animal research. Studying humans has the promise to directly impact and improve understanding of dopamine-mediated behaviors, which are broadly relevant to many areas of psychology and social science. This research project therefore will contribute to an improved understanding of the brain basis of decision-making, enabling insight into how altered brain function, such as occurs with aging and mental health disorders, influences behavior.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dopamine system is involved in many fundamental cognitive and behavioral processes. To date, subclasses of dopamine neurons have been identified that respond to rewards, aversive stimuli, or equally to reward and aversive stimuli. Importantly, recent evidence from both rodent and nonhuman primate studies shows that certain dopaminergic pathways support reward learning and conditioned place preference, while other dopaminergic pathways support learned aversion and conditioned place avoidance. Collectively this body of animal work, which spans multiple labs and species, supports the idea that the dopamine system has anatomically defined heterogeneity. This project proposes to test the hypothesis that dopaminergic function itself is diverse and not consistent with uniform transmission of reward prediction errors. The PIs will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) combined with probabilistic tractography methods to study functional and white matter connectivity patterns of mesolimbic dopamine networks, which include the brainstem substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), during learning tasks mediated by rewarding and aversive outcomes. This endeavor is noteworthy because it extends neuroimaging of the brainstem to include DWI, which enables white matter connectivity measurements between the mesencephalon, striatum and cortex, and because it has the potential to make a fundamental contribution to how decision neuroscience understands dopamine-mediated behaviors. This research contributes to the central aims of neuroeconomics, an evolving interdisciplinary field that provides an exciting educational opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students interested in neuroscience, decision-making, or the social sciences.

This research project will quantify how rivers reestablish equilibrium channel characteristics in response to changes in flow and sediment flux.  The investigators will test the assertion that the equilibrium form of a channel cannot be uniquely defined and that channel properties depend on the dominant mode of sediment transport.  A clear understanding of river channel equilibrium is vital for river management and restoration.

They will use sediment bedload information for quantifying the covariant and non-singular pathways that characterize channel recovery from disturbances, and they will employ mathematical models for simulating channel recovery in systems with varying sediment supply along longitudinal profiles of stream channels.

Droughts are a regular feature of climatic conditions in the western U.S., and global prediction models suggest that they will intensify in the future.  Drought impacts society through agricultural losses, water restrictions, and a range of other damages to businesses, utilities, and industry.  By analyzing paleoclimatic patterns, this project will enhance basic understanding of the ocean-atmosphere dynamics that create persistent droughts in the western United States.  The project will provide new insights into strategies employed by prehistoric populations to cope with these harsh environmental changes.

The project also will provide education and training opportunities for Native American undergraduate and graduate students through laboratory research experiences and fieldwork on tribal lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the western U.S., precipitation patterns during the Late Holocene Dry Period had a persistent dipolar pattern of a dry southwest and a wet northwest, similar to the pattern produced during the modern-day La Nina phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation.

The investigators will use a longitudinal database of U.S. metropolitan areas to analyze the role of changes in the income distribution vs. changes in the spatial organization of households by race, ethnicity, and income across the cities and suburbs that make up metropolitan areas.  The project will provide new insights regarding the extent to which concentration of poverty is a function of the segregated pattern of the housing stock, especially new housing construction, and it will enhance understanding of the contribution of local control of development decisions and restrictive land-use policies in establishing a landscape of housing that creates and maintains concentration of poverty and segregation by race and class.  The project will test the hypothesis that concentration of poverty is the product of larger structural forces, political decisions, and institutional arrangements than usually are considered.  This research will provide the factual and empirical basis to determine what changes are needed in metropolitan development policies and practices if the nation is to reduce the concentration of the poor in high-poverty neighborhoods, and it will contribute to wider discussions regarding the critical contemporary issues of segregation, concentration of poverty, social mobility, and inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lived experience of poverty in the U.S., especially for poor African-American and Hispanic people, is shaped by the spatial organization of wealth and poverty.  Recent research has demonstrated clear links between neighborhood poverty and social and economic outcomes.  Unfortunately, the number of people living in high-poverty ghettos, barrios, and slums has nearly doubled since 2000, rising from 7.2 million to more than 14 million.  These increases were underway well before the recession began in 2007, so they reflect changes in the spatial organization of poverty as well as the effects of the financial crisis.  The investigators will examine the extent to which concentration of poverty has been driven by patterns of housing development that segregate metropolitan housing by type (single-family vs. multi-family), tenure (owner-occupied vs. rental), age of housing (median year built), and housing unit characteristics.  They will determine differential patterns of housing among and within metropolitan areas by assessing the constraints imposed by land use regulations, because density zoning, material restrictions, setback requirements, and other measures imposed by a highly fragmented set of local jurisdictions within metropolitan areas constrain market outcomes and channel housing construction towards local homogeneity and economic segregation at larger scales.  The investigators will use a multilevel longitudinal panel of neighborhoods, political jurisdictions (i.e., cities and suburbs), and metropolitan areas from 1970 onwards in order to decompose concentrated poverty into spatial and non-spatial components and to empirically measure the relationship of the spatial component to the pace and exclusivity of metropolitan development.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qoaedQ0AAAAJ,"['economics', 'sociology', 'poverty', 'inequality', 'segregation']",7418,26,265,273,318,318,314,308,292,279,272,291,302,294,355,348,303,319,245,195,230,255,229,248,191,12

Water is fundamentally connected to both time and space in many indigenous ontologies; its stewardship is a cultural value. Despite the belief of water's central role in networks of non-human living and non-living beings, indigenous peoples have experienced difficulties in the management of their waters. Not only do tribes face broad-based restrictions over the control of water quality on their lands; centuries of colonization, economic exploitation, and the assertion of primacy in water jurisdiction by states has diminished governance options. This research recognizes that conceptions of space and time are central to both water as a whole, and water as it is governed. Spatio-temporalities are fundamental to the establishment of values and vital to socio-cultural relationships. Moreover, since water flows across cultural boundaries and political borders, its governance forces interactions between people with different spatial and temporal experiences, which challenges power dynamics, justice, and equity. The broader impacts of this work address disparities in access to resources and the improved well-being of individuals in society, particularly with regard to diverse worldviews and their role in resource management. This work additionally supports the participation of underrepresented minorities in research as well as increased partnerships between academia and tribal communities by exploring serious threats to water quality that disproportionately affect particular communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research specifically asks: 1) How are space and time recognized, represented, and acted upon in water quality governance by tribal communities?  2) How do various interpretations of space and time between tribal, federal, state and local governments facilitate or inhibit tribes from asserting authority and building capacity in water quality governance? Working collaboratively with the Northern Arapaho and Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribes, this research employs elements of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as a conceptual framework and Participatory Mapping (PM) as a method to collaborate with community members in investigations of particular water quality concerns. Research will culminate in a symposium to understand ways in which results relate to water quality governance to indigenous communities across the United States.

The same time period in Eastern Europe remains understudied, even though it is likely to have been a route of hominin dispersal into the rest of Europe. This high-risk research project will undertake a paleontological and geological survey of the Olte闂傚倵鍋?River Valley, Romania, which is the location of the richest fossil site of mammalian fauna in Eastern Europe from this time period. The investigators will look for evidence of hominin occupation at a few known sites, search for additional sites, and collect data to understand the paleoenvironment of the region and confirm dates for the sites. As an area that served as a likely migration route, new discoveries would shed valuable information on the peopling of Western Europe. This project will encourage gender and ethnic diversity in science by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students at three universities that primarily educate first-generation college and minority students. It will also support early career female scientists, international collaborations among US and Romanian scientists, and community science outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evidence suggests that fossil hominins successfully dispersed from Africa to Georgia and Indonesia by 1.85 Ma, but the earliest evidence in Europe is not until ~1.4 Ma. There are two possible explanations for this apparent late dispersal: 1) some barrier prohibited hominin dispersal into Europe, or 2) hominins were present there earlier than 1.4 Ma but paleontological investigations have not yet uncovered their presence. While sites from this time period in Western Europe have been intensively investigated, paleontological localities in Eastern Europe have not been as thoroughly explored. The Olte闂傚倵鍋?River Valley of Romania has yielded a series of fossil sites that may shed light on dispersal patterns into Europe during the early Pleistocene, and preliminary work suggests that this region has the potential to yield additional sites. This high-risk research project will undertake a paleontological and geological survey of the Olte闂傚倵鍋?River Valley to look for evidence of hominin occupation during the early Pleistocene, and conduct preliminary investigations of the area's paleoenvironment. By locating and analyzing data from fossil sites from the early Pleistocene of Romania, we can determine whether the fauna from these sites were similar to those found at other early Pleistocene hominin sites across Eurasia, or whether there were differences among these sites that were important for preventing hominin dispersals into Europe at this time. Critically, examination of fossils from these localities and identification of any potential stone tools and/or cut marked bones has the potential to establish the presence of hominins in this region during the early Pleistocene.

In turn, mangrove forests are critically important to coastal ecosystem health. This project examines long-term mangrove forest composition based on data collected from archaeological wood samples from South Florida. It makes use of fuelwood residues, a rarely exploited data source, to investigate wood selection and management strategies along with their secondary effects on local forests. A key question being addressed is resource sustainability, as evidenced in changing wood availability. Moreover, the time-transgressive trends in wood species and their growth cycles documented by this research will help to establish a long-term record of forest health and resilience that can be used not only to contextualize the magnitude of recent and ongoing changes, but to aid in understanding legacy effects from activities such as thinning and habitat reduction, as well as from natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) and environmental change. Although coastal forests have long been recognized as providing valuable ecological services, they are endangered worldwide. The importance of coastal mangrove communities to tropical coastal and marine environments and thus also, to human inhabitants and local economies is difficult to exaggerate. These forests provide habitat and breeding grounds for many marine organisms, thus supporting several fisheries. Mangrove forests buffer coastlines against hurricanes and inhibit terrestrial runoff further contributing to ecosystem health and protection. The use of archaeological wood charcoal to establish an historical timeline of mangrove forest presence and growth characteristics will provide a valuable context for establishing modern management guidelines and regulations. To that end, this project is working in concert with local conservation organizations and state agencies; each will benefit through cooperation and data sharing. Furthermore, the research contributes to the education and training of both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as local residents and project volunteers.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One aspect of the research is testing alternative hypotheses generated from prior study of proxy records of sea-level variability over time.

The wood charcoal analyzed here derives from an eroding archaeological shell mound and will aid in the creation of a long-term baseline of forest resilience as influenced by human activity, natural disturbances, and climate change in Southwest Florida's coastal estuary system. The research will also initiate an archaeological site monitoring project that will track rates of shoreline erosion and impacts on both the archaeological deposits and the modern forest/flora. Further, the exploratory excavations will aid in documenting a regionally, rare Archaic Period occupation and will provide preliminary data that will enable future conservation work or salvage excavations at the site.

It is unclear to what extent stone tool behaviors represent changing social networks between groups or responses to fluctuating climate conditions, raw material and reduction differences, chance, or some interaction among these factors. The researchers will apply a novel and quantitative approach to studying the degree of shared material culture among East African MSA assemblages and to provide new insight into the patterns and processes shaping technological variability in space and time. Unravelling these issues is fundamental to answering questions of why, when, and where the modern human species began to display the complex and diverse behaviors that constitutes ""humanity.""  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As numerous, widespread, and enduring artefacts, stone tool assemblages are well placed to investigate these behavioral changes as they represent repeated, cumulative, and time-averaged technological behaviors that transcend generations. This project will support the doctoral training of the Co-PI (Alison Mant-Melville) and museum training for East African students. The methodology emphasizes comparability and reproducibility, which will facilitate the integration of the open-access data with studies in other time periods and regions. Given the public interest in modern human origins, the results will also be shared widely through conference presentations, journal articles, and public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project draws from robust middle-range theory and insights from knapping experiments to connect knapping behaviors with the social transmission of technical knowledge. Multivariate statistical methods on cores, flakes, and tools from 15 open-air assemblages in a range landscape contexts and from four sub-regions of Ethiopia and Kenya will identify ""clusters"" of similar technological decisions at different stages of the knapping sequence. The results will be assessed against model expectations for the effects of different sources of variability. Paleoenvironmental and climatic data for the models will be sourced from published lake cores and site sedimentary contexts. Modelling cultural transmission of technological behaviors between assemblages can serve as a generalized proxy for the degree of social interaction between groups. Systematically demonstrating such relationships is an essential component in any holistic analyses of behavioral change and for assessing the dispersals, contractions, and evolutionary relationships of MSA populations.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sgvFGngAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'Pleistocene', 'Caucasus', 'Neanderthals', 'Human Evolution']",2238,26,18,35,59,47,52,94,95,86,98,97,128,111,182,150,104,149,162,12,4,19,181,165,107,18

To understand the multitude of factors impacting resilience, relief and development organizations often examine adaptive capacity to assess the ability of contemporary countries and cities to respond to and prepare for increases in environmental variation. This project will assess the relationship between elements of adaptive capacity of a water management system that was used for centuries. Such relationships are most visible in the long term where one can observe changes that communities experience as population grows, political and religious regimes change, and the environment varies around them over centuries. In the course of this project, the researchers will also mentor undergraduate students and Cambodian archaeologists in a variety of archaeological field methods and spatial analyses, answering the call to improve STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The archaeological case study, Angkor, Cambodia, was the center of the Khmer Empire for over 600 years (9th-15th centuries CE). During this time, the Khmers developed one of the largest and most complex water management systems in the pre-industrial world. For this project, Ms. Klassen will first develop a chronology of change in the urban layout of Angkor, to identify the nature and distribution of water infrastructure construction over time. Historical, spatial, and chronological data are now emerging that will be synthesized into a comprehensive and geo-referenced inventory of all known archaeological features within the Angkorian landscape. From this inventory, Ms. Klassen will assign features to time periods, then identify a sequence of change in the urban layout of Angkor. She will use geographic information system analyses to quantitatively and qualitatively assess six important elements of adaptive capacity (the amount of water harnessed by the system, investments in infrastructure, human capital, redundancy, equal distribution of resources, and innovation) for eight time periods. The relationships and trade-offs among the six elements will be used to better understand what makes systems resilient. Further, the results will be compared with the centralized vs. decentralized nature of the state during each time period to determine if and how the type of political regime impacts the resilience of the water management system.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7ij-GtQAAAAJ,['Archaeology'],1501,19,29,35,36,34,42,45,47,44,59,42,45,96,71,60,72,63,69,26,41,29,64,73,64,10

One factor that may contribute to these differences is the level of protection that children receive from their mothers' milk. This project will test evolutionary theories about parental investment by analyzing breast milk samples, to see whether the beneficial contents of breast milk differ for mothers of sons versus daughters, by maternal nutritional status, and by a combination of the two. The findings will inform efforts in modern society to reduce the mortality of vulnerable children. The project will provide opportunities for women and minority students to be trained and mentored in laboratory methods and to participate in research with global health implications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH) predicts unequal parental investment between daughters and sons in polygynous populations where somatic or economic conditions of males determine their marriageability. Specifically, it predicts that mothers in good condition will invest more in sons while mothers in poor condition will invest more in daughters because these strategies may enhance their reproductive success. Previous studies on sex bias in human milk quality, particularly milk nutrient levels, have reported mixed results. These studies focused on energy-yielding nutrients (e.g. fat, sugar), but not on other nutritive and non-nutritive components of milk that are indispensable for infants to survive and thrive. This project contributes to this body of research by examining the TWH using not only measures of breast milk energy, but also vitamins (B9 or folate) and antibodies (secretory immunoglobulin A or sIgA) as indicators, of maternal investment. A cross-sectional random sample of breast milk specimens from 220 mothers of the Ariaal tribe, a polygynous population of rural Kenya, will be analyzed. The resulting data will be used to test the following predictions: 1) maternal nutrition (e.g. adiposity, micronutrient status) will positively predict folate/sIgA, 2) this effect will be moderated by the sex of the infant, and 3) milk of under-nourished mothers will exhibit preference toward daughters and milk of other mothers toward sons. The findings will facilitate a multi-faceted view on possible sex bias in human milk components in a specific sociocultural and ecological context. This will contribute intellectually to our understanding of conditional variation in human parental investment, which has important implications for sex differences in infant growth and health.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=YETcZ_YAAAAJ,"['anthropology', 'human evolution', 'human variation', 'maternal nutrition', 'human milk']",868,12,3,3,4,3,9,12,8,27,30,59,56,53,51,78,60,97,72,,,,86,90,61,

This CRISP project will advance our understanding of the effects of different types of interdependencies on the resiliency of critical infrastructures (CIs), targeting water, transportation and cyber infrastructures. Instead of focusing on different infrastructures, this project focuses on different interdependencies including physical-based (primarily co-location), virtual-based (primarily information), and socioeconomic-based (primarily resource management). The project will enhance the resiliency of interdependent critical infrastructures and transform infrastructure management by the integrative decision framework developed for the evaluation of design, operational and organizational strategies.

How do local households negotiate an expected quality of life? Do community interactions shift to become more exclusive and focused on elite members of society? Archaeologists have postulated that political authority and economic practices are not just a coercive component of the ruling elite; rather, household quality of life and social cohesion are a balance of wants and needs of both high status groups and everyday people that are grounded in moral expectations and communal trust. Recent political science studies show pronounced social inequality not only undermines trust at the community level, it also threatens governing bodies and civic engagement. The goal of this project is to add meaningfuly to these current conversations because it provides rich data sets of long-term change on how people negotiate, successfully and unsuccessfully, power dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By comparing households and communal spaces, Barry Kidder will examine how household quality of life and community-building interactions changed (or did not) during this transitional period at the Mayan site of Ucanha. Preliminary research indicates a high quality of life and commnunal prosperity during a former period but greater inequality during a latter. Combining broad-scale excavations, geochemical studies in conjunction with spatial statistics, and the analysis of archaeological and paleobotanical remains, Kidder and colleagues will reconstruct past household quality of life by examining five variables: 1) architectural investment, 2) feasting practices, 3) diversity of household goods, 4) costliness of caching/burial rituals, and 5) the use of space. Spatial statistics with geochemical analysis, particularly, will improve archaeology's ability to study ancient households by capturing patterns of overlooked past activity. Furthermore, this project will contribute to local household quality of life by training descendant communities in archaeological methods that will lead to future employment since archaeological salvage projects are rapidly expanding in the area. By working locally, as opposed to seasonal work in Cancun, salaries will be reinvested in local households and the entire community.

This research is pertinent to the anthropological investigation of how social differentiation between individuals and groups came about in the history of our species and how these earliest social structures may have set precedents for the kinds of extreme inequalities seen in modern day societies.  Moreover, the research focuses on communities of people who moved seasonally with their herd animals and, according to anthropological theories, are not expected to indigenously manifest inequality and social hierarchy.  Rather, pastoral nomads generally live in marginal environments with risk-prone subsistence systems and therefore are expected to form corporate communities that share resources and information broadly.  These expectations raise questions about the massive stone monuments, known as ""khirigsuurs,"" that mark the Mongolian steppe during the Bronze Age and which many researchers have attributed to the personal aggrandizement of nomadic ""elite"" chiefs and warriors.  This study seeks to investigate the degree to which inequality and social differentiation may have been responsible for the building of these impressive labor intensive monuments or, on the other hand, whether these structures were built as a way to create community solidarity and cohesion.  These issues are pertinent to the understanding of social inequality today and whether such differentiation should be seen as a ""natural"" expression of society or as systems constructed by human beings based on social precedents from many millennia ago.  This project will also train US and Mongolian students in field methods and research strategies for archaeological anthropology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to test the different explanations for monument building among Bronze Age nomads in Mongolia, the Tarvagatai Project employs systematic pedestrian survey and excavation of monument and habitation sites.  Analysis of animal bones, site sizes, bronze metallurgy, isotopic signatures, and high resolution radiocarbon chronology will help archaeologists to differentiate between different hypotheses for the construction of ""khirigsuur"" monuments.  In addition, the Tarvagatai research will develop and employ new laser scanning methods for the analysis of skeletal deformations in ancient horse skulls in order to determine whether horse riding and traction may have contributed to early social differentiation among nomads.  These novel methods will not only help archaeologists to explain the presence of horse burials in monumental construction but will also help to solve the mystery of when human beings first began riding horses on the Mongolian steppe.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=08kwYsIAAAAJ,"['archaeology', 'anthropology', 'nomads', 'pastoral nomadism', 'nomadic pastoralism']",1604,20,,,5,15,5,12,30,30,52,62,80,127,110,168,94,143,175,,,,166,148,134,12

This project seeks to identify the specific genetic changes that have allowed populations to survive at high elevations on the Andean Plateau.  Findings from this research will advance our understanding of the ways in which modern human populations have been able to adapt to extreme environments through evolution by natural selection, and will also help to distinguish between natural selection and individual-level developmental adaptability. Improving our understanding of how the human body responds to low oxygen could inform the development of treatments for widespread diseases characterized by low oxygen, such as cancer and heart disease. The project will support student training and mentoring, and results of this study will be shared with the larger research community and integrated into public outreach programs aimed to encourage and financially support participation by underserved public middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andeans exhibit a unique suite of physiologic adaptations to high altitude including a blunted hypoxic ventilatory response, elevated arterial oxygen saturation, and elevated hemoglobin concentration. Their ability to live in chronic hypoxia provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the underlying mechanisms of their adaptation. Recent genomic studies have identified the gene EGLN1 as a high priority candidate locus for natural selection among Andean highlanders. However, the functionally important SNP/mutation(s) has not been identified. To address this gap in our knowledge, the investigators will study how genetic changes mechanistically translate into the dramatic Andean phenotype. They will rigorously characterize the strength of natural selection for two candidate functional SNPs using next generation sequencing technologies; link genotype to phenotype through association testing and mRNA expression analysis; and characterize their functional importance using a combination of Crispr technology and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. By integrating evolutionary and functional approaches to the study of human high altitude adaptation, this research will provide critical insight into the molecular mechanisms governing functional, adaptive change. Additionally, project results will reveal how genetic changes translate into adaptive, fitness-related phenotypes. In so doing, the outcomes of this research will lead to a major change in our understanding of Andean adaptation for which developmental adaptation, as opposed to genetic adaptation, is often considered to be the main adaptive strategy. Furthermore, by contrasting these results to emerging data on the functional consequence of Tibetan EGLN1 genetic changes, this research is uniquely poised to definitively establish convergent evolution between Andeans and Tibetans.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CEnZwqIAAAAJ,"['Population Genetics', 'Human Adaptation', 'Evolutionary Genetics', 'Anthropology']",23362,33,,,,,,71,438,983,1115,1927,2625,2915,2652,2146,1632,1633,1346,,,,1429,1087,941,81

The study is unique in that it specifically will examine the potential physiological mechanisms that are associated with positive male-male social interactions within groups and with collective male aggression between groups.

Both spider and woolly monkeys are characterized by high rates of male-male affiliation and low rates of male-male aggression within groups. However, patterns of aggression between groups differ between these two species: boundary patrols and aggressive encounters between males from different groups of spider monkeys are among the most dramatic examples of collective aggression seen in non-human primates, paralleled only by the intergroup ""warfare"" seen in some populations of chimpanzees, while encounters between woolly monkey groups are frequently more tolerant.

Orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), which have a slow life history and extreme fluctuations in their food supply, are a good species for testing hypotheses about factors that may favor slow juvenile development during evolution. In this project, multiple methodologies will be applied in a long-term study of orangutans in Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesia, to determine how food availability affects juvenile growth and development, and the extent to which juvenile and adult orangutans differ in foraging behaviors, diets, and overall ability to extract energy from foods. The project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and increases scientific capacity near the research site. The project runs parallel to the principal investigator's conservation program that helps conserve orangutans through education, alternative livelihoods, adoption of customary forests, and sharing of research with local authorities. Using social media, website, Facebook, twitter, monthly newsletter, and weekly radio programs, the project educates local and world-wide audiences about the importance of orangutan conservation and the application of research to solving conservation problems.

It has been argued that human evolution has been marked by selection for a slower life history. Existing comparative data on great ape development are limited, and based primarily on captive animals living in energy-rich environment, thus likely experiencing accelerated growth. This study sheds light on the concept of ecological risk aversion by looking at both developmental and ecological influences on digestion. The investigators will use behavioral observation, physiological measures, and data on diet and available food resources to determine: 1) if juvenile orangutans are at greater ecological risk than adults, whether juveniles are able to extract less energy from their food, the role of masticatory force in breaking up food into smaller particles, and how body size determines gut passage rates and how much energy is extracted from food; 2) how juveniles and adults differ in their foraging behavior, diet composition and overall energy expenditure; 3) how juvenile development impacts maternal behavior and physiology; 4) at what rate juvenile orangutans grow and whether this differs depending on food availability; and 5) how juvenile orangutan physiology changes with development and depends on food energy intake. If digestion is impeded when consuming high fiber fallback foods during periods of poor food availability, we can better understand the compensatory behaviors that both juveniles and their mothers take to offset caloric and nutrient deficiency. Because of their smaller body size, incomplete gut biome, and masticatory immaturity, juveniles are predicted to be more vulnerable to periods of food shortage. Additionally, if larger-bodied animals of the same species are able to process fiber more efficiently than smaller-bodied animals, this has could have implications for how the evolution of body size impacts the ability to achieve a higher quality diet.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OF91758AAAAJ,"['orangutans', 'great apes', 'biological anthropology', 'reproduction', 'conservation']",7643,38,135,97,127,150,197,226,310,269,358,422,514,506,475,472,483,474,508,25,26,85,617,532,442,49

Some of the archaic genes found in modern humans appear to play important roles in immunity and in adaptations involving skin and hair, but our understanding of the contributions and effects of archaic genes is still incomplete. This project will study the effects on modern humans of DNA derived from ancient interbreeding, telling us how much archaic DNA is in modern humans and how this DNA affects body fat. The investigator will develop and make freely available statistical tools for the study of interbreeding and adaptive evolution. These tools will address current analytical biases that limit our understanding of archaic genes in humans, and will be useful in other fields of study, like conservation biology, where there is a need to define and distinguish among species. The project will support training of a graduate student in human evolutionary genetics, dissemination of findings as part of an undergraduate textbook on evolution, and K-12 and public outreach through frequent lectures on human evolution to local school and community groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our current understanding of archaic admixture is compromised by pervasive statistical biases. Given that archaic alleles are known to influence modern human adaptive phenotypes at several genetic loci, it is important that these biases be addressed. To correct this problem, this project will develop a new statistical method to estimate gene flow among multiple populations using genomic data. The method will make it possible to estimate levels of archaic DNA in modern human populations, sizes and separation times of ancestral populations, and effects of archaic DNA on polygenic characters such as stature, blood pressure, or body weight. The project will apply this method to a study of fat storage in modern humans, testing the hypothesis that we have inherited from Neanderthals a tendency to store fat - a relic of their adaptation to seasonal food shortages in Pleistocene Europe.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F6Sy5V0AAAAJ,['Human evolutionary genetics'],16970,48,580,580,587,710,722,669,779,740,791,742,738,721,753,671,582,605,593,442,389,477,634,575,486,46

Centralized electricity production and grid connections are multiplying electricity access for cities and industry in emerging economies worldwide, while distributed renewable technologies offer opportunities for communities beyond the grid. These changes are transforming societies and they have diverse impacts on food systems, and ultimately food security, on scales from household to global. At the same time, climate change has the potential to impose both local and global hydrological shocks that affect food and energy systems at multiple levels. Who will benefit from this rapidly changing food, energy, and climate landscape, and who might be left behind? How will technological, investment and policy strategies shape these outcomes? And how might external shocks, arising from global market dynamics and large-scale climate change, alter the course of energy and food security development? The answers to these questions are critical to development in emerging economies and, potentially, to social stability within and beyond their borders. To understand and predict these dynamics, the research team supported by this award will construct a systems-based modeling framework that captures local-scale to national-scale food, energy, and water dynamics in a changing climate. The framework will be implemented for Ethiopia and Mali, two rapidly developing but highly climate vulnerable countries that serve as test cases for a more generalizable analysis system. United States researchers will work with African counterparts and development experts to develop modeling tools and apply them to active and proposed energy and food security initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate objective of this work is to understand coupled system dynamics across scales in a manner that allows one to quantify the sensitivity of critical human outcomes (nutritional satisfaction, household economic well-being) to development and climate adaptation strategies. The research team will approach this problem with an integrated Multi-scale Energy and Food Systems (MEFS) modeling framework that includes a local ""agent-based model"" to capture individual behavior and learning; a scalable multi-player ""micro-economic partial-equilibrium model"" to simulate area-aggregated decisions and outcomes,;and a national computable ""general equilibrium model"" to simulate large-scale policy dynamics. MEFS couples the three models, which makes it possible to study the role that individual behavior and learning plays in area-aggregated decisions and to quantify the cross-scale impacts of bottom-up and top-down development interventions, such as household-level solar energy versus national energy subsidies. MEFS will provide novel insights on food-energy-water dynamics in the sub-Saharan Africa context, while the novel coupling methods developed for MEFS will advance the science of multi-scale systems modeling for research anywhere.

Archaeological research provides a unique and valuable perspective on organizational variation in human societies because of its time depth and ability to access past social and ecological conditions. Hunter-gatherers throughout time have maintained extremely variable forms of political, economic, and social organization, but their means of acquiring and managing surplus and social authority may differ from agricultural societies. Some non-agricultural groups maintained institutional differences in wealth, rank, and authority; others utilized cooperative efforts, temporary leadership, or ritual practice to undertake feats like constructing impressive monumental works or establishing trade networks for specialized artisan products. This project focuses on a particular case of complex coastal hunter-gatherer development in order to contribute to the broader topic of organizational variation among foragers. In addition to extensive and ongoing educational and public outreach, this project will also contribute a detailed, contextualized record of plant and animal remains that may provide valuable data for future studies of coastal and estuary environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan doctoral student Christina Sampson, supervised by Dr. Robin Beck, will investigate the community organization of fisher-hunter-gatherers living on Weeden Island on Florida's Gulf Coast in late prehistory.

This position would have afforded opportunities for trade, competition, and the exchange and development of new ideas. The project's research questions are focused on four topics: (1) the social scale of domestic practices, (2) the tempo of occupation, (3) the extent of local authority over subsistence practices, and (4) the extent of inter-regional interaction.

Such communities first emerged as much as 8,000 years ago in many parts of the world and served as the foundation for the much larger-scale societies with very complex patterns of organization in which the majority of the world's population lives today. The kinds of activities that were concentrated in these early centers varied considerably from one region to another. In some instances increasing craft specialization and economic interdependence between households across a region seem crucial. In other instances religious beliefs and ritual activities were of the utmost importance. And in still other cases, conflict and military defense and offense appear to have played a principal role. In varying combinations, these and other social relationships often created strong inequalities of several kinds around which societies were organized. Just how particular patterns came to be emphasized in different places and how  they led to varying degrees and kinds of social inequalities are not well understood. This is especially true of cases in which growing social inequalities were not grounded in differences in productive activities, wealth, and standards of living among the population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue the possibility that in situations of relatively intense conflict, leaders in warfare acquire considerable prestige and more general authority and serve as the social centers of gravity for larger communities. As most often envisioned by researchers, such a path of development leads to increasing economic control and accumulation of wealth by these leaders, which enables them to broaden their social and political power. A prime opportunity to investigate this line of reasoning is provided by the rapid emergence of Sintashta-Petrovka societies of the southern Urals around 2000 BC. Elaborate warrior graves associated with small, compact, heavily fortified settlements indicate the social importance of war leaders, but little is known of the nature and organization of the communities they apparently led. Tightly-packed residences within small fortified areas have been studied, but held remarkably small numbers of inhabitants, probably representing only a portion of the regional populations of these polities. Previous research has failed to find much evidence of other hinterland communities in the regions around the fortified centers. But little-studied archaeological remains immediately outside the walls of the fortified centers may represent an important additional component of these communities. This research will target those remains and reconstruct the activities, statuses, and standards of living they represent and compare them to those of the people inside the fortifications. This will reveal whether the war leaders, as theorized, took on broader social and economic roles and a prestigious and became wealthy or whether a more egalitarian foundation anchored the society.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3KNlJtwAAAAJ,,4882,33,77,85,86,92,122,130,119,117,119,218,221,281,276,305,301,275,291,71,82,51,341,301,215,11

This project will investigate variability in growth patterns and diet in response to early life environments, using climate, behavioral, and skeletal data for savanna baboons. The research will advance knowledge about relationships between life history flexibility and environmental variability in the human and non-human primate evolutionary record. The project also will support broader participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research, student mentoring and training, and public engagement through Smithsonian Institution programs and exhibits. Infrastructure for research and education will be enhanced by establishing the first available skeletal collection representing primates from a well-documented savannah habitat, thought to have been an important environment shaping early human adaptation. Results from the study will be communicated online, and to local wildlife managers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key questions in biological anthropology concern the role that environmental variability played in shaping modern human behavior and life history, which increases fertility and maximizes offspring investment over a prolonged juvenile dependency. Developmental plasticity, including the capacity to respond to environmental change through shifts in growth rates, maturational timing, and other traits, is a proposed mechanism underlying the modern human life history strategy. However, the evolutionary origins and ecological context of life history flexibility in the human lineage remain poorly understood. This project integrates long-term climate data with developmental, behavioral and ecological data in wild baboons from a single, highly dynamic environment in the Amboseli basin, Kenya, to test how early life physical and social/maternal environments influence (1) hard tissue microanatomical parameters of dental and body size development, and (2) tooth carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of diet quality and composition. Specifically, this research investigates whether offspring born into low rainfall and poor maternal/social environments experience negative consequences that are detectable in hard tissues, including lower quality diets, reduced investment in physical growth, and increased susceptibility to later-life stress.  Elucidating how early environmental challenges in Amboseli baboons are mediated by developmental and behavioral mechanisms will improve understanding of this species' resilience despite significant environmental change.

It will examine trends in nearshore paleooceanographic conditions, human marine resource use, and technological innovation over the past 10,000 years. Erlandson and Ainis will examine trends in the lifeways of maritime people of the Pacific Coast of North America through archaeological, stable isotope, and statistical analyses of cultural deposits from two adjacent rockshelter sites occupied sequentially by the Island Chumash and their ancestors over the past 13,000 years. Colonized at least that long ago by seafaring Paleoindians, Channel Island shell middens have played an important role in the emergence of theories such as the coastal migration hypothsis as a viable explanation for the initial peopling of the Americas. Archaeological remains reveal how islanders interacted with and utilized terrestrial and marine ecosystems for thousands of years, providing pertinent data for modern conservation and management programs that are often constrained by relatively recent and short-term baseline data. Stable isotope analysis of marine mollusks is a proven method for reconstructing oceanographic conditions and identifying the seasonality of shellfish harvest, data useful for reconstructing settlement patterns and nearshore paleoecology. These data will be used to construct a site-specific nearshore sequence for San Miguel Island and explore correlations between ancient sea surface temperature (SST) patterns and archaeological data. This study will contribute to larger research questions related to the antiquity and diversity of aquatic resource use, shifts in resource harvesting practices and human impacts on marine ecosystems, the perceived marginality of island environments, mobility patterns, seasonality of site occupations of some of the earliest maritime people of the Pacific Coast. As the first long-term reconstructed nearshore SST sequence for the region, the results will have significant implications for a variety of research questions in archaeology, historical ecology, paleoecology, marine biology, oceanography, conservation biology, and fisheries management.

The researcher, anthropologist Dr. Lucia Guerra-Reyes of Indiana University, will collect data on existing community perspectives on reproductive decision-making in the context of imminent threat from a disease with severe reproductive consequences. This is an unusual opportunity. Social scientists often study how reproductive decisions are made at the individual and family levels when people learn of the potential of a genetic disease. But  what happens when it is an infectious disease and the whole community and its future progeny are affected? Such a significant threat will be particularly illuminating for understanding disease-related decision making. Knowing how people respond to disease threat is critical for developing effective public health policy and effective messaging. But it is also important for tracking how people's behaviors affect the pathways through which the disease itself evolves and is transmitted. In addition, if the disease emerges as expected, collecting data now will provide a baseline that will permit a more complete characterization of emergent responses to disease threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Belem, Peru, an Amazonian region where the Zika virus is expected but has not yet arrived.

The prehistoric US Southwest is appropriate for study since the process, at different time periods, included both population increase and the melding of multiple social groups. Similar phenomena can be observed in multiple regions within the developing world today and archaeology provides a context to traces such changes over extended periods of time. The intellectual merits of this research include the development of new methods and approaches applying models of social group formation from the broader social sciences in archaeological research. Further, this research will strengthen ties between archaeology and other fields by expanding the range of political and economic contexts considered in comparative social science research on social group formation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Matthew Peeples, Dr. Gregson Schachner, and Paul Reed along with a team of scholars from across the U.S. will conduct archaeological field and collections research exploring the relationship between demographic change and the development of regional-scale social groups in two portions of the prehispanic U.S. Southwest (A.D. 1050-1350); the Mariana Mesa and Cebolleta Mesa regions of New Mexico. Available information from the two study areas suggests that both were occupied by diverse populations including locals with long histories in the region and immigrants from other portions of the Southwest. Using models from multiple social science fields focused on the development of social boundaries in contemporary contexts, the team will explore the role of population size and structure in promoting either the creation of homogenous social groups or the long-term maintenance of diversity. The two study areas, along with previous work in the nearby Zuni area, provide a range of demographic scales to explore this relationship through time across multiple transformations of community organization. The project team includes specialists with backgrounds covering a broad range of material classes (architecture, ceramics, stone tools, basketry, fiber perishables, etc.) which will allow for the documentation and comparison of several different kinds and scales of interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research requires both new data on the nature of settlement and material culture in the focal areas as well as a compilation and evaluation of existing information. Through mapping and/or in-field analysis of 24 major sites in the focal areas, along with re-analyses of existing museum collections, the team will document the changing demographic properties of settlements and regions through time and develop an improved regional chronology and settlement history. The team will then conduct analyses to characterize patterns of interaction and evidence for group formation through time by: (1) documenting the movement of ceramics and obsidian tools through neutron activation analysis and X-ray fluorescence,(2) comparing technological similarities in a range of materials including domestic architecture, ceramics, lithics, and perishable materials, and (3) analyzing highly visible markers of group membership including painted ceramics and public architecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the broader impacts of the study will be the creation of new primary data for portions of the Southwest which have seen little research since the 1960s; providing information essential for evaluating models of social change in the prehispanic Southwest. The project will also result in training and experience for graduate students in archaeology. Finally, the project will produce information and new approaches applicable to evaluating cultural affiliation as mandated by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8B39PWQAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'Archaeology of the North American Southwest', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Quantitative Methods']",2583,27,,,,,,8,16,26,42,58,76,172,160,179,248,246,248,,,,293,249,467,35

Previous studies of collapse events have focused on the organizational breakdown of societies faced with various insurmountable internal and external stressors. These studies tend to portray collapse as infrequent, catastrophic ruptures in the social fabric of societies. Recently, scholars have deemphasized these apocalyptical perspectives by discussing collapse as examples of rapid, lasting structural change within long-term histories. Building on this latter view of collapse, this project focuses on the wide-ranging impacts of collapse on nearby populations by examining the relationships between population movements, demography, and cultural transformations. Neighbors of collapsed polities would have had to contend with reorientations of long-distance exchange networks along with potentially massive influxes of new residents in cases of regional abandonment. One such archaeologically identified collapse occurred at around AD 1350 among the chiefdoms in the Savannah River Valley of Georgia and South Carolina. However, the Georgia Coast, a neighboring region at the mouth of the Savannah River, did not suffer the same mix of circumstances that led to that collapse and remained populated during this time. Several changes noted by archaeologists during this period on the coast could reasonably be linked to those occurring upriver, such as changes in settlement practices, political organization, and the adoption of new subsistence technologies. This research will investigate how these changes along the Georgia Coast were related to the collapse of the Savannah River chiefdoms. Through examination of such changes in traditional ""non-complex"" societies it may be possible to extract basic principles relevant to understanding the massive changes impacting the world today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research will consist of archaeological excavations at the Kenan Field site on Sapelo Island, Georgia. This large site was occupied both before and after the collapse of the Savannah River chiefdoms. Through a combination of systematic shovel test survey, limited test excavation, shallow geophysical survey, and a large-scale radiocarbon dating program, the researchers will produce reconstructions of community organization before, during, and following the collapse of polities in the Savannah River Valley. Anthropologists recognize that the built environment and related spatial practices reflect, reinforce, and transform social structures. Therefore, reconstructions of community organization provide a window into the production, negotiation, and transformation of the social and political practices of the residents of the Georgia Coast.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lo0AqeQAAAAJ,"['archaeology', 'shell middens', 'islands', 'radiocarbon', 'LiDAR']",2638,28,,,,,17,15,44,62,92,55,105,135,138,175,237,243,285,,,,282,310,386,9

Disease processes can also be studied in skeletons, but because not all diseases produce bony evidence, many infectious agents are effectively invisible in the archaeological record. This EAGER project will develop new protocols and best practices for recovering specific pathogen DNA from dental calculus, which is calcified plaque that often preserves on the teeth of skeletons. The investigators will use dental calculus samples from skeletons in the early 20th century Robert J. Terry Anatomical Collection who had clinical diagnoses of tuberculosis, syphilis, or pneumonia - all significant killers in the past. This method could potentially transform our understanding of disease experience in the past by expanding the suite of diseases that we can specifically identify in skeletal samples.  This information will be of great importance in further understanding the effects of infectious disease on human population demographics and evolution. The protocols from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scholarly publications, as well as highlighted in science education programming for broad and diverse audiences at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Mississippi State's Lois Dowdle Cobb Archaeology Museum, and the Oklahoma Educators Evolve initiative. This project is jointly funded by NSF's Biological Anthropology program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and systematically test a novel method for pathogen detection in dental calculus. The investigators will analyze calculus samples (N=60) from Terry Collection individuals with ante-mortem, clinical diagnoses of infectious disease, using advanced techniques in targeted-genomics, metagenomics, and metaproteomics. Specific aims are to determine (1) whether pathogen biomolecules can be successfully identified from the dental calculus of individuals with known infectious diseases; (2) the sensitivity of these pathogen detection techniques; and (3) whether both active-at-death and resolved-at-death infections be detected in dental calculus. If successful, these tools would enable the identification and investigation of specific infectious diseases in human skeletal material, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, and pneumonia, which are otherwise not empirically identifiable with a high degree of certainty in the archaeological record.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=mvjO27wAAAAJ,,1984,24,,,,,,,,,,,,23,49,99,133,134,256,,,,393,396,420,36

Previous scholarship on the development of organizationally complex institutions has focused on defining changes from one type of sociopolitical strategy to another through the identification of particular organizational traits at particular moments in time. However, these critical transformations are inherently embedded in broader historical and relational contexts, and are enacted through new and existing social, political, and economic networks. Archaeology is well suited to elucidating the relationships between social networks and societal change by focusing on the deep historical roots of institutions and capturing the historical and geographic nuances of sociopolitical development. Social networks contextualize societal change by both constraining and providing the means through which information is spread, social movements are facilitated, and ideas and innovations are adopted or rejected. The research will be conducted in the Southern Appalachian region of the Southeastern United States, where at ca. A.D. 1000, political leadership became centralized, large-scale political economies were formed through the mass intensification of agricultural production, social and economic inequalities became engrained, and participation in pan-regional ritual institutions proliferated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social networks at two complementary scales of analysis will be examined: 1) local networks, based on informal and frequent interactions, and 2) panregional networks, based on political affiliation and participation in religious and other cross-cutting institutions. Each network will be interrogated to better understand how they structured the emergence of new organizational strategies. Specific focus will be on the areas of modern day northwestern Georgia and eastern Tennessee where the characteristics and temporality of sociopolitical change followed distinct developmental trajectories. The researchers will construct network histories of Southern Appalachia to compare the differing sociopolitical trajectories of the northwestern Georgia and eastern Tennessee regions. The scale, structure, and tempo of changes to social networks across Southern Appalachia will be elucidated through (a) the construction of a regionally-integrated Bayesian radiocarbon dating program, (b) the construction of a regional database of stylistic and technological ceramic attributes, and (c) the assessment of regional patterning of politico-religious iconography through the analysis of shell gorget motifs and mortuary practices.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UHV8lcIAAAAJ,"['Anthropology', 'Archaeology', 'Eastern North America']",1234,19,,,,,,,,8,12,11,31,43,100,82,95,139,139,,,,195,176,160,12

However, a global crisis is looming, with an unprecedented number of the world's languages estimated to disappear before century's end.  As languages fall silent when there are no remaining fluent first language speakers, they will take with them a unique entry into understanding the capabilities of the human mind. In addition, the loss of languages will end the opportunity to gain insight into local knowledge of the places where they were spoken, as well as the human history and prehistory of those who spoke them.  Nearly one third of the world's six to seven thousand languages are threatened due to the internal pressures of multilingualism. Multilingualism is the use of two or more languages, either by a community or by an individual. Linguists have responded to the challenge of language endangerment by attempting to undertake rich multimedia documentation of such languages before they disappear. However, in many places where multilingualism is common, the languages are under-documented because of insufficient infrastructure and training.  This workshop will offer training for documenting languages in these contexts.  Such training is necessary for three important reasons. First, it will fill the scholarly gaps for languages with little or no documentation. Second, documentation of these languages will increase the scientific understanding of the interaction between multilingualism and language endangerment.  Third, it offers scientists the opportunity to contribute to the creation of a record of threatened human languages. Broader impacts in this project include the facilitation of new international collaborations, the training of a new generation of language documenters in a diverse linguistic region, and opportunities for international research experience for graduate students and junior researchers.<br/><br/>This workshop will convene with its focus on endangered African languages, which are distributed over diverse multilingual environments.  This workshop aims to address this situation through the transfer of skills and the training of West African and American graduate students and junior researchers in state-of-the-art techniques of language documentation and data management. The workshop, which will be held at the University of Education in Winneba, Ghana, will be staffed by an international cohort of experts in documentary linguistics from the United States, Europe and Africa.  Participants will have access to an international network of researchers in endangered language documentation. This workshop integrates theory and technique with actual practice in language documentation. Instructors and students will be involved in hands-on data collection with five speakers of Animere, a highly endangered language spoken in the Ghana-Togo border area, to create a first documentation of the language. Audio and video documentation of Animere will be archived at the established Archive of Language and Oral Resources of Africa (ALORA) housed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, and at the University of Florida's Language Archive (TUFLA), a new language archive, in order to make it widely accessible to researchers and the public.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iShdeAUAAAAJ,"['language contact in Africa', 'Atlantic languages', 'sociolinguistics of writing']",1221,18,14,18,21,21,39,30,55,50,47,45,71,67,60,83,97,71,108,4,9,12,88,86,80,12

This is a cultural transformation that has occurred in many different societies across the world. The formation of villages requires a dramatic social and cultural reorganization, which entails a redefinition of social networks, personal and collective identities, and space and place, as people adjust to their new mode of living. This research will focus on the patterns of continuity and change in interaction and integration across time and space to explore the social processes involved in the cultural transformations that occurred prior to village formation. This process which started thousands of years ago continues today and is fueled by worldwide social mobility. This research also provides training and experience in curation procedures and fieldwork to several undergraduate students, which will assist them in developing the necessary skills to pursue a career in archaeology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is concerned with understanding the social interactions and integration among communities that occurred just prior to village formation. Recent research has suggested that the basic social structure of village life developed alongside increasing sedentism, prior to the formation of villages. The Early Pithouse period (A.D. 200 to 700) in the Mogollon region of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona is ideally suited for this research because it marks just this step of the process. To explore these negotiations, this research uses a multi-scalar, historical framework that focuses on social interactions and integration among communities of practice. The data for this research will rely on ceramics, obsidian, and architectural features from existing artifact collections and excavation reports as well as an ongoing excavation project. Social interaction will be examined through pottery circulation, analyzed through instrumental neutron activation analysis and petrographic analysis, as well as obsidian procurement, analyzed through x-ray fluorescence. Integration among communities will be examined through technological and stylistic attributes of ceramics and architecture. In addition, accelerator mass spectrometry dating of radiocarbon samples will be used to further refine the chronology of the Mogollon Early Pithouse period.

While researchers of ancient and historical human societies have long sought to understand the various forms of imperial conquest and control over incorporated subjects, there is an increasing interest in the activities of local populations within empires. Although the term ""empire"" is rarely used in reference to political states today, many in fact fit this definition because they consist of amalgams of ethnic groups brought together under a central control. Understanding how empires developed is difficult to obtain through analyses of written materials alone, because these tend to ignore the actions and motivations of the non-elite members of societies. However, archaeological investigations of the smaller-scale settlements brought under imperial rule can effectively begin to refine scholarly understandings of the ways in which indigenous populations resisted, grudgingly accepted, or eagerly collaborated with their imperial rulers. Archaeology thereby allows for the development of more comprehensive considerations of empires in which the activities of all social groups within imperial society, not just the most powerful individuals, may be subject to scrutiny. The project will provide ample opportunities for collaboration with international colleagues and local communities, and the collected archaeological remains will form the basis for a future museum facility within the study area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matthew Warren, of the University of Texas at San Antonio, will carry out an archaeological research project to investigate the political and economic effects of imperial colonization in a violently disputed borderland region and the subsequent changes in social organization and activities of its indigenous inhabitants.

The study will be conducted in the San Isidro river valley of western Santa Cruz department, Bolivia, a former territory of the Inkas that experienced a series of invasions by peoples native to the tropical lowlands during the Andean empire's final years. The fieldwork will consist of an archaeological survey of the broader study area, excavations at the central Inka site and several ancient indigenous settlements, and an in-depth analysis of the all of the recovered archaeological materials.

As a result, studies are only sampling from a narrow range of human experiences.  The results of these studies have limited generalizability, failing to reflect the full range of mental and behavioral phenomena across diverse cultures and backgrounds.  However sampling from broader populations is challenging, due to limited opportunities and access, heightened cost, and the need for specific knowledge about how to adapt research protocols to different communities.  The goal of this workshop is to develop some tools and guidelines to help researchers overcome barriers to broader sampling, and to incentivize doing so through better institutional support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this workshop is to develop tools to support and encourage increased robustness and generalizability in the experimental behavioral sciences. The meeting is dedicated to identifying and developing potential solutions to the so-called ""WEIRD people"" problem: the fact that most experimental behavioral science research is conducted with members of WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democracies). The discovery that much of this research fails to generalize to broader populations and fails to capture the range of human patterned variation in thought and behavior creates a pressing need for research approaches to be more inclusive. Although there are researchers throughout the world who have developed effective models for overcoming these limitations, there are significant barriers to achieving robust and generalizable experimental behavioral research for most researchers.  This workshop will bring together scholars from a range of disciplines whose research represents positive case studies of how to overcome these barriers.

This conference has been held every year since 1949, covering a wide range of important topics differing from year to year. GURT 2017 will focus on variable properties in language, and in particular, on how they are acquired. The meeting will consider how the full range of variable properties is acquired by young children or adults, and how grammatical properties may change across generations of speakers. A primary goal of GURT 2017 is to foster interaction and potential collaboration among researchers investigating language from the perspectives of different subfields and using a range of methodologies. The conference aims to make progress toward a biologically coherent account of the full range of variation, bridging the silos that keep sociolinguists from interacting with students of syntactic variation, and keep historical linguists apart from phoneticians working on variability. A primary goal of GURT 2017 is thus to change the dialog and to provide opportunities for experienced scholars to mentor young scholars, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who are working on variation, encouraging them to work across domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kind of variation that language embodies is biologically unusual; it is not found in other species nor in other aspects of human cognition. Navajo speakers, for example, have grammatical structures different from those of Nupe speakers. The conference will address the phonological and syntactic peculiarities specific to particular languages or groups of languages. Linguistic variation includes the variation that yields structural contrasts; variations in the pronunciation of words that are still recognized to be the same; variation that occurs in particular speech communities or in particular styles of speech; and variation in production influenced by interaction with and accommodation to particular interlocutors. All linguistic variation raises questions about how such properties can be discovered and accommodated by young children and by adults.

With many of these languages currently endangered or threatened, the creation of an enduring record of these language is of paramount importance.  Endangered language documentation includes many elements, including raw audio and video recordings, photographs, transcription files, databases, files containing linguistic analysis and other research details, responses to experimental stimuli, and field observations.  Together these files make up a collection of interlinked data for a particular project. For example, recordings go along with their transcriptions, and data in the transcriptions is added to databases.  Managing all these kinds of data is necessary before archiving and making the data widely accessible. Researchers in the language sciences manage a large amount of interlinked data prior to depositing it in an archive. However, there are no guidelines for best practices for this type of collection and there are no standard tools for managing the files. As a result, current practices are inefficient and create bottlenecks that  delay archiving. This project will use workshops to bring together stakeholders in language documentation, including software developers, to develop standardized software tools to address the hold-ups that have the potential to prevent research products from being properly archived and thus publicly accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop series proposed here addresses this obstacle by developing standardized tools for management of linguistic data collections. Such tools will facilitate a more robust and reproducible science of language by providing researchers with standard methods to manage data from the point of collection to the point of archive deposit. The aim is to eliminate the collection management bottleneck and to facilitate greater uptake of language archives. The workshop series will bring together relevant stakeholders including: field linguists who collect data; theoretical linguists who make use of archival linguistic data; experts in data curation; and software developers. In order to encourage broad participation, the three workshops will be scheduled in conjunction with major gatherings of linguistic researchers, including the Linguistic Society of America annual meeting. The outcome of these workshops will be a sustainable plan for development of a cross-platform, open source collection management tool. By making data more accessible and better described this tool will facilitate increased reproducibility and accessibility of linguistic research. This greater availability of primary language resources will transform not only various subfields of linguistics, but also related fields such as anthropology and social psychology, which rely on careful management of field data. Further, by taking a stakeholder-driven approach via a series of workshops, the project has the potential to encourage broad adoption of collection management tools by both the language documentation community and by linguists representative of other subdisciplines.  In doing so, the project will decrease the barriers to proper description and archiving of linguistic data of a wide variety. Moreover, by improving the dialogue between language documenters, language archivists, linguists and developers, this project will serve as a model for the development of software in linguistics, as well as other social and behavioral sciences.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=h_0PokwAAAAJ,['documentary lingusitics'],1582,23,4,7,14,7,20,11,33,37,59,38,113,97,108,88,145,134,164,,,4,127,176,143,14

Statistics published in 2016 by Glottolog, an online reference guide to the languages of the world, notes that this represents 242 distinct language families and 188 families with only one member (""isolates""). Scientific knowledge of how languages are related to one another and how languages change (known as ""historical linguistics"") has focused primarily on one language family, the Indo-European family, which includes English, Spanish, among others.  How do studies of other language families, particularly those that are endangered, inform scholarly research about the way languages change?  And how does the field of historical linguistics advance scientific understanding of endangered languages? This workshop will address these two questions as part of an international conference on historical linguistics.  Broader impacts include funding to support the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Broader impacts also include dissemination through the inclusion of online materials which will widen access, and submission of select conference papers to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at San Antonio will host the 23rd International Conference on Historical Linguistics (ICHL 23).  Bridget Drinka, along with collaborator Patience Epps, of the University of Texas at Austin, will organize a conference program that includes a special focus on endangered languages and historical linguistics.  ICHL 23 will include plenary speakers and discussants, drawing from endangered language researchers who comprehensively represent different geographic regions, language families, and typological diversity.  The speakers will bring a breadth of methodological and theoretical expertise relating to the study of language change, spanning traditional reconstruction, approaches to language contact, phylogenetic methods, and other perspectives.  Additional presentations at the conference will touch on the intersection of endangered language study and historical linguistics. Participating researchers will include junior scholars whose participation will be funded by this award. ICHL 23 will focus attention on the exciting new directions in which these fields are moving. A relatively recent subfield of linguistics, language documentation has been gaining ground in recent years. As language documentation continues to develop its depth of engagement with and contribution to other subfields, the value of this area amongst scholars and members of the general public will grow. Likewise, the subfield of historical linguistics has much to gain from the exciting new directions offered by work in underexplored language families and regions of the world.

It evaluates the gradual growth and expansion of an ancient city to determine how social status and access to resources influenced location and directly tests broader, anthropological questions regarding human behaviors, power dynamics, family and kin relationships, and communities. The relationship between resources and human decision-making has implications for modern communities facing resource and population pressures. The success of global political systems and their supporting settlement and impact on the world around them are issues of interest to anthropologists, archaeologists, ecologists, geographers, and urban studies. This research will result in the completion of a doctoral dissertation and will be disseminated through several peer-reviewed journal publications, presentations to both the public and academics, and social media outlets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most societies with relatively high populations non-elites are unable to freely select settlement locations without the being impeded by social or economic brokers often controlled by political elites. However, in communities with lower density populations and less political control from elites, commoners are often able to (more) freely select locations to live; their settlement decisions are often based on personal preference and access to resources. Changes in political leadership in conjunction with increased population density can directly impact the settlement distributions across a community. The dissertation student, Amy Thompson will explore these possible shifts in settlement selection at a Classic period (AD 250-800) Maya center Ix Kuku'il, located in the southern foothills of the Maya Mountains in Toledo District, Belize and compare her findings to a nearby, yet well-studied ancient Maya center, Uxbenk闁?as both sites are situated in a similar geographic setting yet appear to have differing occupational histories.

This study investigates social drivers of food change in the past and provides a comparative case for considering the role of food and food practices in social and economic transformations in small-scale societies. More broadly, this research will improve and contribute to long-term histories of cuisine and traditional food practices of ancestral peoples of contemporary Western Puebloan communities (i.e., Acoma, Zuni, Hopi). The collection of this data will provide training and research experience for several undergraduate students in multiple archaeological analytical methods at Arizona State University.

Due to the vast reach of social media, the sympathy, distress, fear and outrage that such crimes provoke can extend across the country.  Research has found that the stress of experiencing traumatic events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters can have strong neurobiological and psychological effects on direct victims and related family members. However, there has been very little research on whether there are similar immediate and lasting effects on those people who are physically distant and unrelated, yet feel connected to, the victims. When a traumatic event is both a terrorist attack and a violent hate crime targeting members of an identifiable group, others who feel a shared identity with that group may be affected by such an event in even more profound ways. The investigator Paul Hastings (University of California, Davis) tests these hypotheses in the aftermath of a recent mass shooting event in Florida. The investigator draws from social psychology theories of identity and minority stress, and biological psychology theories of allostatic load and stress physiology to test whether the degree of shared identity with the victims of the massacre moderates the impacts on individuals geographically distant from the event.  The neurobiological and psychological impacts immediately after the event are assessed as well as recovery from these effects over the following six months.  By extending science's understanding of how shared identity status shapes the broader community's neurobiological processes and psychosocial adjustment following targeted terrorist attacks and hate crimes, this RAPID project will identify factors that may promote recovery from such traumatic events.  This will inform efforts to design community-focused program to build resilience in relevant groups, and interventions to reduce the negative effects of catastrophic social injustices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator uses the naturally occurring event of a recent mass shooting to test key hypotheses about the impact of shared identity status -- specifically, ethnic and sexual identity -- on response to geographically distant events. The terrorist attack and hate crime that occurred on Latin night at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016 is the largest mass-shooting massacre in modern U.S. history. The targets and direct victims of this massacre were predominantly young adult members of a multiple-minority group: the LGBTQ Latino/a community. Thus, the current research involves a sample of LGBTQ Latino/a, plus comparison samples of straight Latino/a, LGBTQ White, and straight White young adults from the metropolitan area of a city in northern California that is of similar size to Orlando. These groups systematically vary in either sharing or not sharing both the sexual identity and ethnic/racial identity characteristics of the majority of the victims of the Orlando massacre. Within two months of the massacre, participants complete questionnaires to assess identity relevant variables, experiences of stressful life events and of victimization, and measures of psychological well-being and mental health.  Over two consecutive days, participants then provide multiple saliva samples, and complete additional questionnaire measures. The saliva samples will be used to assess levels of a stress hormone, cortisol, and two inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein, to measure activity of the immunological system. These measures are repeated six months later.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9cMeUO0AAAAJ,['Developmental psychology'],17198,64,198,272,311,354,376,507,472,653,653,739,842,943,939,1080,1184,1265,1307,74,129,170,1371,1409,1430,126

The genesis of sociopolitical stratification is a global phenomenon that archaeological inquiry is uniquely positioned to address by examining the development of inequality and the subsequent social and political ramifications over long periods of time. This project will examine the key themes of migration, health, and differential access to resources in order to investigate how rising elites gain and control sociopolitical power. Understanding these complicated processes and how social complexity, identities, and roles are negotiated, legitimized, and maintained over time has broad reaching implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine the development of sociopolitical stratification by examining human skeletal remains to assess patterns of mobility, diet, and health during the development of sociopolitical stratification. This project will be conducted on Preclassic period (1000-250 AD) Maya skeletal remains from Cuello and Colha, two sites in northern Belize with large Preclassic skeletal assemblages. The Preclassic period is characterized by broad shifts in mortuary behavior that were concurrent with other significant changes in architecture, site organization, social structure, and material culture throughout the Maya area that relate to the emergence of complex, stratified society. While the development of social hierarchy has been linked to the appearance of the complex mortuary behavior observed at Cuello and Colha, the relationship of these burials to emerging social and political stratification remains unclear. The proposed research will use archaeological data in conjunction with data on diet, geographic origins, and dental health to investigate these broad sociopolitical changes among the Preclassic Maya. Specifically, this study will employ stable carbon (闂?3C), oxygen (闂?8O), and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopes to assess diet and mobility patterns. By analyzing Preclassic mortuary behavior, this project will examine how social complexity, social inequality, and identity are generated, legitimized, and maintained through the political manipulation of the dead.

Preliminary data that this research team has gathered on stress symptoms between two different sets of recovering disaster victims contradict widely held assumptions about variation in responses to extreme events. This project provides researchers with the opportunity to assess disaster management longitudinally. The intellectual merit of the project is in the improved scientific understanding of the variance between recovery and psychological wellbeing rates in different extreme settings, and the sociocultural responses to human-made disasters. The broader impacts of the project are that it will strengthen collaboration among research communities internationally, provide professional development opportunities at the research site, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and train graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection. Project findings will also be presented to non-academic audiences, improving efforts to communicate science to the public.

Within the context of this project, political collapse is understood as a transformative event, in which local populations abandon (and sometimes even destroy) old expressions of power and move to form new political affiliations, change economic possibilities, and build new social ties. In archaeological studies, the research on political collapse has focused largely on its impact on people living in large cities; much less attention has been devoted to examining how people living in rural areas engage with the shifting political, economic, and social tendencies that follow large-scale political transformation in order to ensure their own well-being. By taking the perspective of a rural community, the Monte El Santo Archaeological Project (MSAP) will include rural people in the narrative of post-political collapse, an arena in which they have traditionally been overlooked. As a doctoral dissertation project, the MSAP will provide training and professional preparation for a doctoral student from the United States, and incorporates additional graduate students from both the United States and Mexico, fostering international collaboration. The data collected during the project will be made available to researchers through publication in academic journals. The results of the research will be shared with the public via presentations and question and answer sessions to both the local Mexican community and to the public in the United States through organized museum talks and lecture series. The project results will also be available online at www.colorado.edu/rioverdearchaeology, a bilingual website about archaeological research in the Rio Verde region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MSAP researchers will directly engage with questions of political collapse, rural agency, and economic integration both intra and inter-regionally. The project will focus on the rural site of Monte El Santo in Coastal Oaxaca, located 11 km north of the urban center of Rio Viejo. Research at Rio Viejo has shown that following the political collapse, commoner households were able to produce and manage surplus cotton and gain greater access to long-distance goods including obsidian, green stone, and alabaster. The MSAP will expand on this research by asking: what were the economic conditions like for rural communities following collapse? Did common people living in former political and demographic centers have economic advantages following collapse relative to those in rural communities because of better access to economic resources (e.g. good land, established exchange partners) that had previously been controlled by regional elites? And if so, how did rural communities respond to these changes? The proposed study has merit beyond archaeological research by recognizing the variability in which collapse is experienced, even within a single region.

Such learning is particularly consequential during adolescence, when increased exploration and autonomy confer many opportunities to make new choices. Poor decision-making represents one of the greatest perils of adolescence, with mortality rates doubling during this developmental stage, in large part due to risky or impulsive actions. However, the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning this developmental period of increased risky decision-making are not well understood. The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize how the dynamic developmental trajectory of brain circuitry involved in learning through positive and negative experience shapes real-world choices. Drawing upon behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging approaches, this work will examine how neurocognitive changes in value-based learning may give rise to a window of increased risky and impulsive decision-making during adolescence. A refined understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental changes in real-world decision-making has broad relevance across a number of societal domains including public policy, adolescent health, and juvenile justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will test whether risky and impulsive choice may stem in part from developmental changes in two specific aspects of how individuals learn from experience: (i) the relative weighting individuals place upon positive versus negative outcomes of past actions and (ii) the degree to which individuals form and recruit mental models of the potential future consequences of their actions. A developmental sample of participants, spanning late childhood to young adulthood, will complete sequential decision-making tasks in which they make a series of choices that can yield good or bad outcomes. By applying computational reinforcement-learning models to participants' choices in these tasks, we can precisely quantify developmental changes in these component processes of learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to characterize corresponding developmental changes in the brain circuitry engaged during learning. We will assess whether these neurocognitive changes in learning are predictive of participants' reports of their real-world risky and impulsive behavior, and whether they have distinct explanatory power from that of behavioral economic tasks that are commonly used to index risky and impulsive choice tendencies, but do not involve learning. A longitudinal follow-up session will enable assessment of the covariance between changes in learning and real-world risky and impulsive behavior as participants advance in their transition through adolescence.

In response, new research focuses on alternative ways to manage the lasting effects of fire, rather than prevent it. To understand the role of fire in modern ecosystems, the long-term history of human influence on fire regimes and biome productivity must be considered. Archaeological and paleoecological research demonstrates that humans have intentionally set fires for millennia to transform the arrangement and diversity of resources within their landscape, with global consequences for terrestrial and atmospheric systems. Anthropogenic fire, meaning fire intentionally set and controlled by humans, has played a vital role in transforming and maintaining agricultural landscapes. Consequently, the beginning of agriculture often coincides with changes in fire frequency and vegetation communities. This project combines multi-dimensional research on anthropogenic burning with archaeological measures of prehistoric agricultural land-use to investigate the origins and evolution of Neolithic (7,700-4,500 cal. BP) agricultural landscapes in three case study areas in eastern Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work integrates new field and laboratory methods, quantitative models of wildfire and its ecological effects, and an ""off-site"" archaeological perspective to study the impacts of anthropogenic fire on the human and environmental aspects of ancient agricultural landscapes. The Mediterranean landscape is uniquely suited to investigate prehistoric anthropogenic fire due to its long-term history of agricultural land-use, infrequent naturally caused fires, and fire-sensitive ecosystems. This research encourages international collaboration between archaeologists and fire scientists with implications for long-term management of similar fire-prone ecosystems around the world, including southern California, coastal South Africa, southern Australia, and the entirety of the Mediterranean Basin. Fieldwork for this project is conducted in collaboration with American and Spanish archaeologists, paleoecologists, and fire scientists. This diverse, international team combines multiple perspectives on the role of anthropogenic fire in forest ecosystem function, maintenance, and sustainability. Laboratory work conducted at Arizona State University also provides scientific training and mentorship to undergraduate students studying archaeology, paleoecology, and fire science.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_X0uLJkAAAAJ,"['complexity', 'anthropology/archaeology', 'landscapes', 'GIS', 'computational modeling']",6319,45,87,58,96,82,139,185,121,265,173,234,227,310,417,325,409,379,499,58,85,35,582,630,552,69

Early research on human well-being and the environment showed that strong, collectively governed institutions help people to manage common lands in ways that enhance ecosystem services and quality of life.  This knowledge has been a key facet of biodiversity conservation and resilience of rural societies worldwide.  Some communities are able to adaptively manage their natural resources much better than others under conditions of rapid change and uncertainty.  What factors enable collectively governed management institutions to effectively respond to potentially catastrophic environmental disturbances?  In rural societies that are urbanizing, activities of daily life increasingly take place outside the family home, in ""non-family organizations"" that expand people's perspectives and choices, such as schools, stores, employers, and health clinics.  These non-family organizations are not collectively governed and have no clear constituents or responsibilities other than to respond to supply and demand for their services, goods, and experiences. In this project, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the responsiveness of resource- management institutions to rapid environmental change is ultimately tied to the distribution and types of market-driven, non-family organizations within communities.  They will conduct their research in the forested buffer zone of the Chitwan National Park, Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot that is home to the endangered Bengal tiger and more than 200,000 Nepali people who live and farm nearby.  One of the world's most invasive plants, Mikania micrantha (""mile-a-minute weed"") recently has spread through community forests and degraded critical ecosystem services that affect wildlife habitat and the livelihoods of residents.  To explore the links among non-family organizations, management institutions, and the spread of Mikania, the researchers will collect social and ecological data in 21 heterogeneous community forests to develop models of social-ecological vulnerability and resilience to environmental change.  They will conduct two experiments to test the relative strength of factors related to Mikania success, including an educational intervention with management institutions, and a common garden experiment that manipulates environmental variables linked to Mikania growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the ability of the ""family modes of organization"" framework, a powerful explanatory tool in demography, to identify factors that cause coupled natural and human systems to be vulnerable or resilient to rapid change.  The project will be an exemplar of ""translational science,"" interdisciplinary research focused on practical solutions to current problems.  The investigators will translate research findings into local action through an intervention aimed to slow the catastrophic spread of invasive, exotic species that threatens biodiversity and human well-being. More broadly, the research will aid sustainable development efforts in other settings in south Asia and the Pacific through partnership with a non-profit organization focused on solving issues in agriculture and the environment.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for a new cohort of junior scholars by involving them in interdisciplinary, international research focused on real world problems and their solutions.

As urban populations continue to grow, cities face new challenges to feed their residents in healthy and sustainable ways. One recent solution to this issue has been urban agriculture, which simultaneously ""greens"" blighted urban areas while making healthy produce accessible to city-dwellers. Though urban farms and gardens have sprung up in dozens of American cities, its ultimate success depends on its long-term implementation over multiple generations. The field of archaeology is well positioned to contribute to this effort because archaeologists can document the successful strategies used by ancient sustainable communities. Some civilizations fed themselves with urban agriculture for centuries, and modern society is beginning to recognize that it can learn a lot about long-term sustainability from those ancient societies. One such civilization, the Maya of Mexico and Central America, is the subject of University of Michigan archaeologist Chelsea Fisher's research into the origins of ""intra-settlement or ""community"" agriculture. Many Maya cities are dispersed or ""non-nucleated"" with low density of structures: they maintained open spaces in their settlements; evidence suggests that some of these spaces were used for intensive urban agriculture. Though archaeologists recognize that many huge Maya cities of later time periods (ca. 250-900 CE) fed themselves with urban agriculture, it is not fully understood (1) how those sustainable strategies developed in the first place, or (2) how those strategies actually worked at the level of individual households and communities. Until those questions are answered, the potential for what modern society can learn from the ancient Maya example remains underdeveloped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fisher's strategy for investigating the origins of Maya urban agriculture is to strip it down to the basics: to study a small community, Tzacauil, that was settled right at the time that the Maya were first learning how to be farmers. Tzacauil, located in the Mexican state of Yucat闁荤姴顑戠粻? has unique conditions that allow for full archaeological exploration of early (ca. 250 BCE - 250 CE) Maya houses and land-use modifications in the surrounding landscape. Fisher will conduct excavations at nine house groups at Tzacauil in conjunction with rigorous investigation of agricultural features and land-use patterns (e.g., terraces, berms, reservoirs) in the areas between and around houses. Using the archaeological data collected at Tzacauil, Fisher will analyze how multiple generations of Tzacauil families interacted with each other and with their increasingly agricultural landscape. By comparing households' interactions alongside their investments in the landscape, Fisher will explore the development of Tzacauil as an agricultural community. This research is important both for the field of Maya archaeology and for issues of modern community sustainability. Fisher's research at Tzacauil clarifies the early origins of settlement and agriculture in the Maya area, while also providing fine-grained information about how individual households managed the logistics of community agriculture. These insights stand to increase archaeology's ability to contribute long-term data that are potentially instructive for cities interested in promoting community-based sustainability and urban agriculture today.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=f9MP1g4AAAAJ,"['Latin America', 'archaeology']",10336,52,268,268,325,304,267,312,293,301,454,440,461,499,510,479,461,543,527,210,202,205,480,401,307,13

Roper, from Kansas State University, and Dr. Linda Scott Cummings, from PaleoResearch Institute, will collaborate on a study designed to develop a pre-treatment protocol for correcting age-offsets on AMS radiocarbon dated ceramic residue. Since its introduction in the mid-twentieth century, radiocarbon dating has been vital to archaeologists as well as biologists, geologists and scientists conducting basic and applied research in other fields. The method has seen considerable advancement in the ensuing decades, enabling development of evermore accurate and precise timelines.  Capable of producing high precision dates, the AMS technique permits assay of small materials, such as individual corn kernel fragments or seeds that are short-lived and contemporaneous with their context, thus yielding ages with higher accuracy than ever before. Also, the range of organic materials believed to be appropriate for archaeological dating is broadened.  Charred food burned onto ceramic vessels during cooking, often termed ceramic residue, is one of the materials now commonly selected for dating and increasingly used in North America, Europe, and Asia.  As its use increases, ceramic residue ages are often noted to be older than dates on other short-lived material from the same context, and thus are not accurate. Continuing to assume the accuracy of these dates and integrating them into timelines degrades chronologies precisely at the time the discipline is able to produce timelines of moderately high resolution and enable archaeologists to work toward viable narratives of historical process.&lt;br/&gt;Two previous approaches to addressing the problem have included determining chemical composition as a predictor of which samples likely are affected, and developing correction factors for ages. Neither is proving capable of satisfactorily addressing the problem; indeed, recent conclusions regarding correction factors are that age offsets are too variable for any single local, or regional correction factor to be accurate.  The study team for this project proposes a third approach that includes a pre-treatment protocol to remove and discard compounds responsible for the anomalous dates. As a result, dates may be obtained on a fraction of residue shown to produce dates contemporaneous with associated short-lived materials. Limited trials have produced encouraging results toward developing a ceramic residue treatment protocol for general use. AMS dates on residue and on context materials known to produce accurate ages will be paired to test the efficacy of the developing method. Tests will consist of dating multiple fractions, including removed compounds, from a few residues to obtain information concerning the old carbon content. Samples will be drawn from late prehistoric individual dwellings in the North American Great Plains that had use-lives on the order of a decade to a decade-and-a-half. Testing and vetting methods aims toward development of a pre-treatment protocol capable of obtaining accurate dates on ceramic residue anywhere in the world, as residues are fast becoming a significant part of the radiocarbon dating record. Furthermore, this method will lead to a future effort involving chemical separation of compounds containing old carbon in or adhering to other materials, opening the door to application of this protocol to additional samples so they may produce accurate and concordant radiocarbon dates.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CGt_hQgAAAAJ,"['Information systems', 'software engineering', 'e-health applications', 'women in engineering', 'artificial inteligence']",3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,,

For example, in the sentence ""What do you see?"" the question word ""what"" parallels the object in the answer: we say ""I see a car"", so ""what"" corresponds to the thing that we see. The word ""what"" appears to start after the verb, but moves to the front of the sentence. This study will examine grammatical constraints on this displacement in languages where the grammatical subject can appear in two different forms depending on whether the verb is intransitive (e.g., ""run"") or transitive (e.g., ""eat""): ergative languages. In most ergative languages, the subject of a transitive cannot displace at all. Linguists do not know why; perhaps it has to do with the difficulty in processing such displacement. To test this, the researchers will use eye-tracking to investigate whether this displacement is particularly difficult in the few ergative languages that can move both kinds of subjects (such languages are about 10% of all ergative languages). Avar, a minority language of the Caucasus, has already been investigated. In this project, they propose to study Niuean, an endangered Polynesian language spoken mainly in New Zealand. The choice of Niuean is critical because its structure is the mirror image of Avar structure and will allow researchers to fill in an important gap in the understanding of ergativity.  That in turn will lead to novel ways of modeling the structure of complex sentences and long-distance relations in natural language. If these studies of ergative languages show that speakers pay attention to the notion of grammatical subject, regardless of its form, this would constitute novel confirmation that the abstract notion ?subject? is psychologically real. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few minority languages have been studied using experimental methods, so this study will set an important precedent for combining experimental methods with field linguistics. The research team will be working with the National Maori Language Institute, with the Faculty of Maori Development (Te Ara Poutama) at Auckland University of Technology, and with colleagues at the University of Auckland.

In August of 2016, historic flooding in the greater Baton Rouge, LA area resulted in 13 deaths and an estimated 8.7 billion in damages. While this flooding occurred in one region of the country, natural disasters take many forms and can occur in all parts of the United States and around the world. A clear understanding of the consequences of natural disasters on cognition, especially for older adults, has important scientific and societal impacts. The research supported by this award will examine functioning in multiple cognitive domains following a disaster to assess the consequences of stress on cognition and the impact on everyday functioning in a number of real-world situations. The study will measure these cognitive domains at two time points to allow for consideration of how individuals recover following such events. Tracking the relationships among cognitive domains across time has implications for basic understanding of the architecture of cognition as well as how it is influenced by disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID), Dr. Katie Cherry (Louisiana State University) and her research team will explore several key elements of cognition that relate to functioning ""in the moment.""  They will obtain measures of immediate memory, or working memory, sustained attentional resources, long-term memory, and intelligence in a longitudinal design with data collection at two points following disaster exposure.  By examining working memory, and its relationship to other key constructs of cognitive functioning, the research team will gain valuable knowledge regarding the consequences of natural disasters on the moment-to-moment cognition that is critical when responding to a disaster. Prior research studies have noted the relationship between working memory and long-term memory as predictors of fluid intelligence, or the ability to detect patterns and solve new problems in the moment, with working memory accounting for unique variance in fluid intelligence.  In the current study, the longitudinal association of working memory, sustained attention, long-term memory, and fluid intelligence will provide further evidence of the critical role that working memory plays in fluid intelligence, and will significantly extend prior research by assessing the relationship between these objective measures of cognition and self-appraisals of functioning and sleep disruption in daily life.  Additionally, the research team will measure these variables in three groups of participants that vary in degree of flood-related impact and prior losses from previous hurricanes in the South Louisiana region.  The research will further consider how adults across the lifespan may show different effects of such disaster-related stress on cognitive functioning. With respect to broader societal impacts, the proposed research will yield critical new evidence to inform understanding of the time course of cognitive vulnerability and recovery after single and multiple disaster exposures.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ESt-gTkAAAAJ,"['cognitive aging', 'disasters and healthy aging', 'applied gerontology']",6516,47,124,141,178,171,208,298,284,287,303,266,324,364,337,312,354,345,361,61,68,109,428,329,397,38

The case of emergency medical responders is intriguing and oftentimes problematic. As public service providers, they are street-level bureaucrats who work on the frontlines of the post-9/11 security state, facing political, legal and ethical collisions between the security of the communities where they live and work and their social-humanitarian responsibilities to saving lives. Professional ethics and healthcare laws require that first responders provide help without regard to the legal status of their patients, but as state actors they are also invested with political and symbolic functions of governmental authority and tightly integrated into the federal emergency preparedness and homeland security infrastructures. The study examines the relation between local governments and taxpayers that fund fire, rescue and emergency medical services, and federal and state governments, which set and implement national security, border control and immigration policies. The project will be instructive to EMS-related policy and regulatory efforts as they relate to both broader concerns about national security and public health. The project would also promote the advancement and training of students in methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, while broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ieva Jusionyte of the University of Florida explores the everyday practices and experiences of first responders - firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics - who work or volunteer for fire and rescue departments on both sides of the Arizona-Sonora border to expand our understanding of the human and social consequences of security policies and border enforcement. This project asks: (1) what effects do security policies, planned and executed at different government levels, have in the communities where they are applied? And (2) how do potential contradictions that result when these policies are put into practice impact border security efforts? Dr. Jusionyte will seek answers to these questions by engaging in a twelve-month-long ethnographic research in rural and urban communities of Southern Arizona, where she will actively collaborate with research assistants and community partners from the fire and rescue departments. The research team will conduct a series of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and archival research in order to explain how conflicting policies at different levels of governance can result in potentially deleterious consequences for people who experience them, and assess the implications that these effects have on first responders as frontline state actors.

Children appear to be better at learning new languages than adults, who instead have very mixed outcomes in how well they ultimately learn a new language. For decades, research has attempted to understand why adults experience more difficulty in learning new languages and what characterizes good language learners compared to less successful language learners, so that we can use this information to improve teaching methods. From this research, we have learned how certain factors contribute to the outcomes in new language learning, but much of the variability remains unaccounted for, suggesting that there is still a piece of the puzzle missing. With National Science Foundation support, Ms. Kinsey Bice, working under the direction of Dr. Judith Kroll, will investigate how individual differences in learning may shape patterns of new second language learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project will examine how previous language experience combines with general cognitive resources to affect the trajectory of new language learning. Previous research has identified differences in the way that the native language is processed that may contribute to the trajectory of new language learning (i.e., fast and slow language learners), and that may also be affected by how speakers recruit various aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, pattern abstraction) when processing their native language. This project will examine how these differences in skilled language processing predict the trajectory of new language learning, as well as whether the differences are related to variation in non-language abilities. Bilingual speakers, who already have experience with learning a new language and who do not use either language exactly as monolingual speakers do, have previously been found to be better at acquiring new languages, but bilinguals differ from each other in many ways that affect their language learning outcomes. This project will compare both monolingual and bilingual speakers in how they process their skilled languages and how they learn new languages. Behavioral methods and brain potentials will be used to determine whether the brain reflects some learning processes that are not apparent in behavior alone. The bilinguals tested will be typical college students who are taking advanced foreign language classes, as well as heritage Spanish speakers who are raised in Spanish-speaking homes but then educated in English.

This study uses a novel developmental approach to test whether midfacial reduction of the skull in primates is a byproduct of growth of neighboring structures (e.g., eyes and teeth). For example, does selection for a precocious visual nervous system fundamentally affect midfacial patterns of growth? Do proportionately large deciduous maxillary teeth and their successors have transient or lasting effects on development of paranasal spaces of the maxilla? To answer these questions, cadaveric samples from over seventy specimens (including 20 species of primates) will be studied. Specimens of different postnatal ages will be studied using an innovative combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and microscopic study of decalcified samples.  The result is a novel approach for mapping regions of bone deposition and resorption in three dimensions. The project will create unique three-dimensional 'growth maps' of primate skulls in relation to functional units of the head (eyes, nasal airways, teeth). Three-dimensional skull form and growth maps will then be compared among primates that differ in the extent to which the eyes are convergent (forward-facing).

Specifically, it examines the development of the cultural stereotype that links males but not females with intellectual brilliance and genius. Previous research has found that academic disciplines that are believed to require a ""spark of genius"" tend to have the largest gender gaps. Because many science fields are portrayed in such terms, the ""brilliance = males"" stereotype may be an important factor in explaining the persistent gender gap in these disciplines. The primary goal of this research is understanding how this stereotype is acquired over the course of development.  Investigating the development of this stereotype will inform how the stereotype might steer capable young women away from pursuing careers in science and technology and may also inform the optimal timing of potential interventions to block its adverse effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of three studies to examine three crucial developmental issues. First, it investigates the development of children's knowledge of the cultural stereotype that males are more likely to be brilliant than females. Second, it investigates the development of gender differences in children's motivation to engage in activities portrayed as requiring high levels of intellectual aptitude. Finally, it investigates longitudinally whether internalizing the stereotype against females' intellectual abilities undermines young girls' subsequent motivation to engage in activities that are said to require brilliance and giftedness. This research explores the development of a set of processes that ultimately limit opportunities for women. As such, these studies will improve parents', educators', and policy-makers' ability to intervene at the root of the problem to promote greater gender equity in those domains of academia and industry in which women have traditionally been underrepresented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is being co-funded by Developmental and Learning Sciences, Social Psychology, and Science of Broadening Participation within the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and by the Education and Human Resources Directorate's Core Research program and the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering program.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-DZfNWIAAAAJ,"['developmental psychology', 'cognitive psychology', 'social psychology']",9225,45,,,,,25,35,59,55,133,102,169,269,346,534,707,933,1143,,,,1163,1430,1694,210

Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AjKs41AAAAAJ,"['Archaeology', 'Aztecs', 'Household Archaeology', 'Gender', 'Ceramic Analysis']",329,9,,,,,,1,1,4,10,6,23,11,42,35,49,15,42,,,,35,21,22,8

The project will focus on the Omo-Turkana Basin and support a workshop allowing local and international researchers to share experiences and synthesize existing knowledge about developments in the region using a social-ecological resilience framework. The workshop will open up opportunities for future multi-disciplinary research by supporting the formation of an umbrella organization for ongoing research in the region, strengthening linkages between researchers, and allowing members to develop collaborative research agendas. International students and early career researchers are also well represented, enhancing the network's capacity for future growth. A wider outcome of the workshop and network will be to inform decision-makers in the region of the results of on-going research, contributing scientifically robust evidence to better inform debate among policymakers and the public. In addition to a multi-disciplinary, landscape-scale situation analysis, the workshop will generate a series of policy briefs to facilitate the dissemination of outputs to non-academic audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages the concept of resilience and will use the workshop to advance the idea of resilience assessment. An objective of the workshop and research network will be to ascertain whether the large-scale land-use change occurring in the Omo-Turkana region supports the economic and social goals declared by project planners, or whether economic growth is being prioritized over the quality and resilience of environmental and social systems. Given the landscape-wide impact of development in the Omo-Turkana Basin, a theoretical basis is required that integrates contributions from multiple disciplines and therefore represents all elements of a social-ecological system. Resilience is one such theory, and this project will contribute to the literature by using the strong representation of social and political sciences in the network to better address equity and power relations within a resilience framing. Such a framing has generalizable relevance for other contexts, and as such, should be useful to science and society well beyond the specific case at hand.",2016,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AekczQMAAAAJ,"['Resilience', 'food systems', 'social-ecological systems']",1528,15,,,,,,,,,,4,27,44,60,92,105,143,172,,,,265,249,302,31

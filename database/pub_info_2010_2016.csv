We describe the preparation of highly selective Pd catalysts involving the deposition of n-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings. These coatings improve the selectivity of 1-epoxybutane formation from 1-epoxy-3-butene on palladium catalysts from 11 to 94% at equivalent reaction conditions and conversions.

Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides to saturated epoxides is particularly difficult given the reactivity of the strained epoxide ring, and traditional platinum group catalysts show low selectivities. We describe the preparation of highly selective Pd catalysts involving the deposition of n-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings. These coatings improve the selectivity of 1-epoxybutane formation from 1-epoxy-3-butene on palladium catalysts from 11 to 94% at equivalent reaction conditions and conversions. Although sulphur species are generally considered to be indiscriminate catalyst poisons, the reaction rate to the desired product on a catalyst coated with a thiol was 40% of the rate on an uncoated catalyst. Interestingly the activity decreased for less-ordered SAMs with shorter chains. The behaviour of SAM-coated catalysts was compared with catalysts where surface sites were modified by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or sulphur atoms. The results suggest that the SAMs restrict sulphur coverage to enhance selectivity without significantly poisoning the activity of the desired reaction.",{}

The new information gleaned from this specimen adds to our knowledge of this genus in several ways. Afropithecus exhibits an atypical pattern of canine dimorphism, and is probably more easily sexed by the pattern of variation in its upper premolars. Both phenomena are likely related to the modification of its antemolar dentition for the purpose of sclerocarp harvesting. The new fossils clarify the role in this adaptation of the premolars, which appear specialized for initiating and propagating cracks in large food items bearing protective coats.

The close physical relationship among apes, or hominoids, had already been recognized a century earlier by Carolus Linnaeus (1759). Living hominoids are united by features related to habitual orthogrady and belowbranch behaviors: broad torsos with widelyspaced shoulder joints, stiff backs, long forelimbs, mobile limb joints, strong grasping ability, and the absence of a tail (Huxley, 1863; Harrison, 1987 & 1991; Shoshani et al., 1996). Humans lack several of these features, such as relatively long arms, as a result of secondary adaptation to bipedalism. Cranial attributes also unite hominoids, including wide anterior palates and relatively large brains (Jerison, 1973; Rae, 1997). Hominoids also have extended life spans with delayed maturation (Kelley, 1997), and occupy similar ecological niches all species but humans inhabit tropical forests and rely significantly on ripe fruit and leaves for food (Fleagle, 2013).","{'2022': '1', '2023': '1'}"

Using a unique, community approach to psychosocial recovery, Bethel House focuses as much on social integration as on therapeutic work. As a centerpiece of this approach, Bethel House started its own businesses in order to create employment and socialization opportunities for its residents and to change public attitudes toward the mentally ill, but also quite unintentionally provided a significant boost to the distressed local economy. Through its work programs, communal living, and close relationship between hospital and town, Bethel has been remarkably successful in carefully reintegrating its members into Japanese society. It has become known as a model alternative to long-term institutionalization. In A Disability of the Soul, Karen Nakamura explores how the members of this unique community struggle with their lives, their illnesses, and the meaning of community. Told through engaging historical narrative, insightful ethnographic vignettes, and compelling life stories, her account of Bethel House depicts its achievements and setbacks, its promises and limitations. The book is accompanied by a DVD containing two fascinating documentaries about Bethel made by the author-Bethel: Community and Schizophrenia in Northern Japan and A Japanese Funeral (winner of the Society for Visual Anthropology Short Film Award and the Society for East Asian Anthropology David Plath Media Award).

Therefore, it should be possible to develop future processing tomato hybrids for Chinese Taipei that possess sufficiently high levels of TYLCD resistance.","{'2013': '1', '2014': '1', '2015': '1'}"

Topics addressed include:* popular concerns about the nature of language variation;* characteristic structures of different dialects;* various interactive patterns characteristic of social groups;* the school impacts of dialect differences in speaking, writing, and reading, including questions about teaching Standard English; and* the value of dialect education in schools to enable students to understand dialects as natural and normal language phenomena.

Dialects in Schools and Communities is rooted in questions that have arisen in workshops, surveys, classes, discussion groups, and conversations with practitioners and teacher educators.

In fact, Wolfram (see Wolfram 2007, this volume) observes that the role of regional differentiation in AAL has often been misunderstood and misrepresented by sociolinguists, leading to one of the major sociolinguistic myths about AAL—The Homogeneity Myth. According to this myth, there is uniformity in AAL in the United States and in the African diaspora in which regionality is invariably trumped by ethnicity. In racialized, popular culture, it is often assumed that “all Black folks talk the same way,” but there is also a more sophisticated version of the homogeneity assumption in which sociolinguists maintain that there is a uniform core in the vernacular speech of African Americans throughout the United States.

While sociolinguists conveniently refer to ‘speech community’as a primitive sociolinguistic notion, defining the speech community can be theoretically elusive and communities can be quite fluid. William Labov, a pioneer in the development of fieldwork methods as well as other areas in sociolinguistics, defined the speech community as a group of people with shared norms, or common evaluations of linguistic variables (1966, 1972b).

Some scientists prefer not to talk about “facts” because it is difficult to tell what is a fact and what isn’t, and physicist Sean Carroll (2009) observes that “one might go so far as to argue that what counts as a ‘fact’depends on one’s theoretical framework.” The extensive description of African American Language (AAL) over the past half-century has led to a fairly well-established tradition of study and a particular set of sociolinguistic axioms; in fact, there now appears to be a sociolinguistic AAL canon (Wolfram 2011).

The out—comes of language contact have included the dynamic incorporation of structural traits from heritage languages, the accommodation of local and regional structural traits in emerging socioethnic varieties, the reallocation and reconﬁguration of traits derived from the contact situation itself, and linguistic innovation taking place within developing and durable socioethnic varieties.

First, they involve exercises that rely on “language intuitions.” By language intuitions, I mean the inner knowledge about language that comes from the fact that speakers of a language have internalized language patterns and therefore can make choices based on that knowledge. This knowledge stands apart from the ability to talk about language in technical terms. Everyone who speaks a language has language intuitions, whereas only linguistically trained professionals typically would have the knowledge to discuss these patterns in technical detail. Second, the exercises examine how judgments of linguistic well-formedness, or “grammaticality,” intersect with judgments of social acceptability. For many laypeople, linguistic grammaticality and social acceptability are not distinguished, but it is essential that this distinction be recognized in studying language, particularly in the study of language varieties that have been socially stigmatized.",{}

In this article, I discuss some recent developmental research that sheds new light on why we are more likely to experience certain fears over others, and how attention and learning might work together to produce some of our most common fears and anxieties.","{'2012': '1', '2013': '2', '2014': '10', '2015': '8', '2016': '8', '2017': '5', '2018': '3', '2019': '7', '2020': '5', '2021': '2', '2022': '6', '2023': '3'}"

The current experiment examines the relationship between a common parental report measure of temperament – the Infant Behavior Questionnaire – Revised (IBQ-R) – and measures of frontal EEG asymmetry in infants. We examined associations between the subscales of the IBQ-R and frontal EEG asymmetry scores recorded during a combined series of neutral attentional and putatively emotional recording conditions in infants between 7 and 9 months of age. We predicted that approach-related subscales of the IBQ-R (e.g., Approach, Soothability) would be related to greater left prefrontal asymmetry, while withdrawal-related subscales (e.g., Distress to Limitations, Fear, Falling Reactivity, Perceptual Sensitivity) would be related to greater right prefrontal asymmetry. In the mid- and lateral-frontal regions, Approach, Distress to Limitations, Fear, Soothability, and Perceptual Sensitivity were generally associated with greater left frontal activation (rs≥.23, ps<0.05), while only Falling Reactivity was associated with greater right frontal activation (rs≤−.44, ps<0.05).

Newly exposed sediments documenting the changing hydrology and climate of the region have allowed our team to begin studying changing dynamics of hominin setlement paterns in response to fluctuating climates and water availability. To date, our archaeological and geomorphological research in the now dry marsh bed has identified prehistoric occupations from the Late Lower Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic, and Upper Paleolithic that correspond to relatively dry conditions when the Druze Marsh wetland was reduced in size. Separating these occupations are extended periods when the wetland increased in size and depth, expanding at times to a shallow lake, and drowning land previously available for hominin occupation, a situation that forced hominins into the surrounding uplands and along the river channels.

Unfortunately, these systems still pose major shortcomings for field work as they are large, heavy, require specific working environments, and can only be used after elaborate settings. Scanning is also time consuming and can halt excavation in that area for a few days. In our project we used a new system by Z-Corporation that features a handheld 3D surface scanner. This scanner is very light, accurate, portable, and can be set up in minutes. In order to test the scanner, two experiments were undertaken. First, we simulated bone burial and excavation. The bones were scanned several times throughout the “excavation,” each time revealing more parts. The scans were then merged to create a complete model. In the second experiment, we scanned the cast of the Kebara burial, emphasizing the delicate bony structures such as ribs, phalanges, and vertebra. On this surface scan we superimposed CT scans of the original bones. This was done in order to have a firsthand view of what the burial looked like in situ.

Comparative study reveals that despite their diversity, the outcome for each society was the same: the breakdown of low-density urban centres in favour of compact communities in peripheral regions. The result of this, an ‘urban diaspora’, highlights the relationship between the control of water and power, but also reveals that the collapse of urban centres was a political phenomenon with society-wide repercussions.","{'2015': '3', '2016': '8', '2017': '10', '2018': '11', '2019': '9', '2020': '12', '2021': '22', '2022': '14', '2023': '20', '2024': '3'}"

There is a lesson here on how people and water managers responded to long-term climate change, something our own society faces at present. The basis for royal power rested in what kings provided their subjects materially—that is, water during annual drought via massive artificial reservoirs, and spiritually—that is, public ceremonies, games, festivals, feasts, and other integrative activities. In the face of rulers losing their powers due to drought, people left.

AD 550-850)(Figure 10.1). Several factors influenced the number of supporters at any given center, the main one being the prosperity of the royal court. Powerful kings emerged in areas with noticeable seasonal variability and plentiful fertile land (Lucero 2003, 2006). Powerful Maya polities did not emerge along rivers as one finds in Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, the coastal Andes, and other regions throughout the world; nor did the Maya rely on massive irrigation systems. Instead, powerful Maya rulers emerged in areas lacking rivers or lakes, where agriculture depended primarily on rainfall. During the four-to six-month seasonal drought, people also needed drinking water in areas without access to permanent water resources. Farmers lived in such areas due to the large pockets of fertile agricultural land. Lucero has argued elsewhere (eg, 2002, 2003, 2006) that differential access to dry-season water necessitated cooperation between political elites and thirsty farmers, laying the foundation for the emergence of complex polities. Elites, as patrons, exchanged access to potable water and hosted expensive community rituals in exchange for labor, goods, and services from client farmers. Such events acted to solidify these critical economic connections. In this scenario, patron-client exchanges originated as a compromise between the descendants of the earliest settlers, who originally controlled access to fertile land rich in aguadas (natural rain-fed sinkholes), and latecomers …","{'2016': '1', '2017': '1', '2018': '1'}"

This fossil was recovered from 60 m below the surface of a cenote (a water-filled karstic sinkhole). Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy was used to identify post-depositional chemical and mineralogical diagenesis accompanying fossilization. CL employs electron beam bombardment to stimulate visible light emission from the minerals comprising the fossilized tooth based on the major and minor element composition. Thus, CL analysis enables the user to identify diagenetic mineral recrystallization and replacement of the three major tissue types in sloth teeth: orthodentine, vasodentine and cementum. Results from CL analysis demonstrate that orthodentine, which is the least porous tissue type, is most resistant to alteration. Cracks in orthodentine cemented with diagenetic calcite crystals were avoided during sampling for radiocarbon dating and stable isotopic analyses. Twenty bioapatite microsamples (5-15 mg) were drilled from the orthodentine along 8.5 cm of the growth axis of the tooth. The results of isotopic analyses (delta (super 13) C:-9.1 to-10.9 ppm; delta (super 18) O: 26.9 to 29.1 ppm) establish a pattern of covariance that reflects moderate seasonal variation in stomatal conductance and evapotranspirative water stress of the C (sub 3) plants that this sloth consumed at the end of the last Ice Age.

We provide a brief overview of resilience and coping resources and then consider the possibility that traits and motive dispositions may serve as strengths.

We propose that the world makes sense and that the subjective feeling of this sense, when noticed by awareness, is the experience of meaning. For our purposes, then, meaning is a fundamental aspect of awareness associated with the detection of lawfulness, regularity, and pattern.

Within this perspective, personality is best identiﬁed with the strategies that individuals use in confronting developmental tasks that organize and deﬁne their purposeful action at various periods in the life course. Although compelling, this reconceptualization is not without its difﬁculties. For instance, the assumption is made that all individuals are preoccupied with the same life tasks--that undergraduate subjects all share equal interest in social and academic challenges. Also, Cantor and Kihlstrom tread rather gingerly on the ﬁne line between nomothetic and idiographic research. To our minds, they stress the nomothetic when they ought to stress the idiographic (eg, in the deﬁnitions of the life tasks themselves), and they emphasize idiographic characteristics when they might opt for more nomothetic dimensions (eg, individual construal styles within the life tasks). Through an examination of speciﬁc instances in which, by our standards, the social-intelligence approach goes awry, we hope to reveal the general biases that underly Cantor and Kihlstrom’s conceptualization of personality.

Space–time clustering is modeled in seismology by self-exciting point processes and the focus of this article is to show that these methods are well suited for criminological applications. We first review self-exciting point processes in the context of seismology.

To overcome this limitation of previous work, this paper provides the following key contributions. First, we provide a model of crime diffusion based on a quantal biased random movement (QBRM) of criminals opportunistically and repeatedly seeking targets.

We then move on to a detailed description of research on embodied processing’s role in emotional perception and emotional language comprehension, the role of embodied metaphor in understanding interpersonal relations and morality, and the role of mimicry in social judgment. Finally, we discuss the applicability of embodiment theory to understanding and perhaps helping to ameliorate impairments of social functioning, using autism and depression as two illustrative examples.

They also recognize perceptual input from other people, such as their faces and bodies, as meaning that those people feel “joy” and “sadness” and “fear.” This chapter is about the representation of emotion concepts. What allows individuals to judge a face as expressing “disgust,” and what happens when they identify the word “cruel” in a text?

In this opinion paper, we describe a theoretical framework that assumes potential emotional disorders in Parkinson's disease and Tourette's syndrome based on motor disorders characterizing these two pathologies. We also review different methodological barriers in previous experimental designs that could enable the identification of emotional facial expressions despite emotional disorders in PD and TS.","{'2014': '1', '2015': '1', '2016': '4', '2017': '2', '2018': '2', '2019': '3', '2020': '2'}"

However, surprisingly, this gender bias has not been investigated for suboptimal presentation of emotional expressions. Our first experiment aimed at investigating the existence of such a bias for very fast presentation of the stimulus (20 ms onset) on the basis of a classic priming procedure commonly used in affective priming studies that involved the use of a single prime. Our second experiment aimed at proposing a new method involving four fast, repeated presentations of the prime-target pairs (based on the innovative design proposed by Höschel and Irle), that could be used to reduce the gender bias in future studies in …","{'2017': '1', '2018': '3', '2019': '2', '2020': '1', '2021': '1', '2022': '2'}"

Darwin believed that facial expressions are vestiges of solutions to long-past evolutionary challenges (Darwin, 1872); for instance, the lifted upper lip and wrinkled nose accompanying feelings of disgust probably evolved to help block or expel noxious smells or poisonous food. According to the Darwinian account, social animals, including our ancestors, began to use facial actions to communicate internal states and external dangers to others. Later, the communicative purpose of the facial movements eventually superseded the functional purpose (Darwin, 1872; Frith, 2009; Hess & Thibault, 2009). However, the expressions of modern-day humans may still serve those original functions. For example, when individuals made facial expressions of fear (compared to neutral emotion), they executed more efficient eye movements in the localization of targets, their visual fields were subjectively larger, and their nasal volume and air velocity during inspiration increased. All of these reactions are useful in preparation for fighting or fleeing from a threat. In contrast, facial expressions of disgust appear to be associated with the constriction and slowing of such processes (Susskind et al. 2008; cf. Krusemark & Li, 2011) so that perception and ingestion of toxic or rotten objects can be minimized. Thus, expressive facial action can aid in generating the bodily responses that promote successful resolution of challenges to survival. Still, human facial expressions are primarily communicative, and are a means to quickly convey status, motivation, affect, and …","{'2016': '1', '2017': '1', '2018': '2', '2019': '3', '2020': '2'}"

The set of social concepts includes emotion concepts, bases of knowledge that are critical for understanding one’s own feeling states and for anticipating and perceiving the feelings of others (eg, Niedenthal, 2008). Such concepts guide an individual’s social behavior because they support acts of categorization, interpretation, and prediction about the attitudes, behaviors, and intentions of other individuals. For example, upon accepting an invitation to a jazz concert, we rely on our concept of this type of social situation in order to choose what to wear, what time to arrive, and how and when to applaud once we are there.

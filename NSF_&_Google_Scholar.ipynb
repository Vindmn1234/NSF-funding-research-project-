Variation in cortisol concentrations can reflect physiological stress, and prolonged elevation of circulating cortisol can significantly affect individual and population-level health. In a previous study, we found that urinary cortisol concentrations in grey-cheeked mangabeys ( Lophocebus albigena ) were higher at a highly disturbed site (Mainaro) in Kibale National Park, Uganda compared with a minimally disturbed site (Ngogo) in the same habitat. Here, we expand on this research, reporting on cortisol concentrations in two other cercopithecid monkeys ( Cercopithecus ascanius and Piliocolobus rufomitratus ) at the same two sites. We hypothesized that C. ascanius would show no difference between sites, given its …', 'Citations': {'2016': '2', '2017': '2', '2018': '3', '2019': '4', '2020': '1', '2021': '4', '2022': '3', '2023': '1'}}\n",

However, given temporal variability in resource abundance, animals can more easily meet nutritional needs at some times than at others. For species in which sociality is particularly important for fitness, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other group‐living primates, the influences of social factors can be particularly strong, and likely interact closely with ecological factors. We investigated home range use by a community of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, to determine whether range use corresponded to energy‐based optimality principles. Chimpanzees were particularly attracted to areas of the home range where individuals of Ficus mucuso (a large but low‐density resource) were found, but …', 'Citations': {'2018': '3', '2019': '3', '2020': '1', '2021': '4', '2022': '2'}}\n",

Primates overwhelmingly occur in countries in the Global South, while primatologists have historically hailed mostly from the Global North, not range countries. Imperialism directly facilitated pioneering primatology fieldwork, including CR Carpenter’s in Panama and Malaya (Ahuja, 2013; Carpenter, 1934, 1940; Haraway, 1989) and Jane Goodall’s in Tanganyika (Goodall, 1962; Haraway, 1989; Rodrigues, 2020). Primatology, field biology generally, and conservation have always been deeply dependent on Global South institutions, people, knowledge, and abilities (Das & Lowe, 2018; Haraway, 1989; van Wyhe & Drawhorn, 2015). Nevertheless, Global North researchers still have vastly greater access to research resources and outsized roles in decision making (eg, through domination of journal editorial boards and service as …', 'Citations': {'2022': '3', '2023': '9', '2024': '1'}}\n"

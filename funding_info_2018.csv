Keith,M,Murphy,kmmurphy@uci.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,03/01/2019,02/29/2024,209801.00,"Communication among humans is known to be complex, which is perhaps why some technologies of communication go unrecognized by their users. For example, written communications, whether public signage, billboards, books, instruction manuals, or even consumer electronics interfaces, depend on the purposeful deployment of typefaces and fonts. The typeface or font chosen in each case carries its own meaning, which influences the message received and resonates with readers through these shared cultural forms, even if readers are unaware. Surprisingly, considering typeface's ubiquity and importance, this area of social life has been little studied. Social scientists have examined typeface primarily in narrow, cognitive terms, such as by studying relative readability. But much wider research is needed to understand how the many different typefaces that populate societies are created, selected, and used, and how they ultimately build and influence communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Keith M. Murphy, an anthropologist at the University of California at Irvine, will undertake an ethnographic and discourse analytic investigation of how varieties of printed language mediate communication. The research will focus on typographic design and pedagogy; decision making around the use of typeface for public communication; and the curation and cultivation of typographic knowledge. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, video-recorded activity analyses, and archival research, in studios, classrooms, and archives, primarily in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. Data analysis will include an innovative use of techniques from archaeology to examine relations between typographic specimen categories and contexts of use. Findings from this research will elucidate how typeface influences the messages people send and receive. Theoretically, the research expands upon social scientific understanding of the materiality of human communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Focusing on the Red River of the North, which separates Minnesota and North Dakota, the investigators will compile data from tree-ring sequences of long-lived trees, timbers from historical buildings, and subfossil logs from alluvial deposits to produce a composite record that spans the last several centuries.  These records will facilitate more accurate estimates of the frequency and magnitude of floods prior to the 20th century.  The project will increase understanding of the factors that influence flooding over longer time periods, with surrogate records providing data for two or more times the duration of instrument-based flood records.  The historical extension of flood records is especially valuable for studying very large floods that occur infrequently.  New insights generated through this project can help to determine whether extreme floods on major river systems are becoming more common as natural and human-related factors change in river basins.  By demonstrating how natural sources of flood information can contribute to flood mitigation decisions prior to the construction of major infrastructure, this project will reposition paleoflood hydrology within the broader field of hazard preparedness.  The investigators will collaborate with U.S. Geological Survey staff at the Dakota Water Science Center to use paleoflood estimates in the assessment of future flood risks.  Project results will help those responsible for managing rivers as well as residents and decision makers to evaluate vulnerability to floods and to weigh the potential benefits of proposed infrastructure, such as the construction of a 36-mile, $1.7 billion diversion channel that would redirect floodwaters around the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will determine how the extraordinary 1826 Red River flood documented downstream in Canada in historical accounts also affected the American stretch of the river.  Red River floods have caused more than $3.5 billion in direct damages to American communities over the past two decades and have spurred the construction or proposed construction of nearly $2.5 billion in flood mitigation infrastructure.  Because the known record of Red River floods only extends back to the late 19th century, other sources of information are needed to estimate the risks of future severe floods.  Using an analog approach to compare tree-ring evidence associated with recent major floods with known stage and discharges of older events only present in the tree-ring record, the investigators will produce estimates of the relative magnitudes of earlier floods.  For old trees that extend back into the early 19th century or earlier, the maximum stage of past floods will be inferred from the vertical position of anatomical abnormalities along the tree stem.  The new paleoflood record for the Red River will enable the investigators to answer questions regarding the synchrony of flooding along the entire reach of the river and to gauge how flooding on the northern Great Plains is related to variability in climate and other environmental factors at local and regional scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF Career project examines parenting processes among a sample of African American fathers, and explores how these parenting practices influence the academic and social adjustment of African American early adolescents. Two-hundred and forty African-American fathers and their adolescents (aged 11-12 years old) will be surveyed once a year for three years. Father, adolescent, and mother reports will be utilized to gain multiple perspectives on fathers' parenting practices and adolescent adjustment. This investigation has four specific aims: 1) to investigate determinants (such as adolescent gender; intergenerational factors; residential status; maternal relationships) of African American fathers' parenting practices; 2) to examine whether fathering ideologies (e.g., beliefs about parenting) explain the association between fathering determinants and parenting practices; 3) to identify whether African American fathers' parenting practices change or are stable across adolescence; and 4) to explore how parenting practices are associated with African American adolescents' academic and social adjustment outcomes (e.g., academic performance; self-regulation; psychological functioning).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to expanding the research on fathering practices in African American families, this investigation has the potential to inform future strategies to promote academic achievement and social adjustment. Also, this NSF Career Award includes multiple community-focused educational and outreach activities. First, in collaboration with the Historic Columbia Foundation, the investigator and her research team will develop a curriculum that bridges archaeology, history and psychology for use with adolescents. An additional component of this curriculum will include a joint father-adolescent learning activity. Also, educational outreach materials (e.g., flyers; workshops) will be developed for local school districts and educators regarding the importance of father involvement during adolescence. Last, in efforts to increase exposure to science research and associated careers, this project will provide intensive mentoring and training opportunities for underrepresented high school, undergraduate, and graduate students."
Alan,C,Yu,aclyu@uchicago.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/15/2018,02/29/2020,30648.00,"Language change is inevitable and constant: all spoken languages evolve over time in their fine-grained speech patterns and the sound-to-meaning mapping of words. The study of sound change is important for understanding the mental representations and cognitive mechanisms underlying speech communication. The Workshop on Sound Change will take place at the University of California at Davis, June 20-22, 2019. The meeting will bring together researchers working on sound change who come from a variety of different backgrounds and disciplines to have conversations, integrate their perspectives and insights, and make substantive progress on questions the remain in the field. Potential collaborations and research that emerge from the meeting may offer new insights into the social, cognitive, and linguistic factors at work when a language's sound patterns change over time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As not all speech communities are equal, and the consequences for differences in the make-up and size of a community could impact how sound change occurs in a language. To this end, the workshop will feature a special theme on sound change in endangered and small speech communities. Sound change research, as in most work in phonetics and phonology, has focused on languages that have historically been dominant or where speakers are easily accessible. The dynamics of language endangerment and interaction between small groups of speakers may provide unique opportunities for sound change to take place. Small speech communities have different social factors at work than large communities, leading to the phonetic and cognitive influences to interact and diffuse in different ways when there are fewer agents. How sound change might originate and diffuse in speech communities of different sizes is poorly understood. Furthermore, endangered and small languages are often heavily influenced by other languages and cultures, making sound change more likely. In order to make useful models and predictions about when and how sound change will occur, we need to explore these patterns in diverse speech communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These linguistic ecologies and the languages used to sustain them can begin to breakdown as speakers transition to larger world languages. Siriano and Desano, two languages of Northeastern Amazonia, have traditionally been maintained through linguistic exogamic practices which are now breaking down with the increasing influence of Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilson Silva of the Rochester Institute of Technology will undertake a three-year study of Siriano [sir] and Desano [des] before further influence of language contact makes this difficult. These languages exhibit a number of typologically noteworthy features of broad scholarly interest such nasal harmony (where nasality extends over several segments), tone (the use of pitch for meaningful contrasts), noun classifiers (classifying nouns grammatically in terms of universal semantic parameters), and evidentiality (indicating what kinds of evidence are available for a given statement). Research products will include a linguistically annotated database, a reference grammar for Desano, audio and video documentation and preliminary description of Siriano. Silva's research will be useful in reconstructing the genetic relationship among languages of the Vaupés Linguistic Area to which Desano and Siriano belong. Understanding the structures of these closely related languages of the Eastern Tukanoan branch of the Tukanoan family will shed light on the nature of language change through contact with other languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has strong support from the communities and their leaders, and involves close collaboration between researchers and community members in Colombia and Brazil where these languages are spoken.

Nazarre,,Merchant,merchann@eckerd.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,08/31/2021,173544.00,"Languages change over time by accumulating small grammatical differences, and child language learners must be sensitive to these small differences. A robust theory of language change must then be able to articulate what are possible historical language changes and how these changes are transmitted intergenerationally. This project will address these issues by making concrete the notion of distance between languages and will determine how learners can utilize these small distinctions in learning. Dr. Merchant offers that there are parallels in the way that grammars change over time and learners navigate these changes to the way that RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequences change over time and the corresponding phenotypes produced by these RNA sequences. Genetic notions of distance between phenotypes are directly applicable to notions of distances between languages, and these distances are directly relevant for explaining language change. In addition to providing a better understanding of how languages change and how learners acquire these changes, the project will create a large repository of analyzed languages allowing researchers to build on the insights gained in this project. Furthermore, the project will provide valuable STEM training for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will help to develop the online database. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical core of the project involves developing and extending formal theories of language, language learning, and language change by incorporating ideas from genetics, topology, cognitive science, and linguistics. In particular, the project will accomplish these tasks by developing and expanding three interrelated components: (1) software tools will be developed that will allow linguists to calculate and compare formal theories of grammars, determine distances and adjacencies between languages, including distances arising from the genetic structure of grammars and those arising from the properties of the grammars (in the sense of Alber &amp; Prince 2017), and evaluate the outcomes of learning algorithms that rely on different notions of grammatical distance. (2) An online repository of diachronically relevant analyzed linguistic systems will be created. (3) The learning algorithms using ideas of grammatical nearness will be applied to the analyzed systems of the repository to evaluate diachronically realistic and informative learning algorithms. This work will produce new models of language learning, diachronic change, and will contribute a significant body of publicly available data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tens of thousands of defendants each year are now offered a pathway to avoid felony convictions by completing therapeutic activities and passing drug tests for designated periods of time. By analyzing the role and consequences of these pretrial diversion programs, this project will contribute to knowledge about the impacts of the contemporary criminal justice system. It also will provide information to policymakers, legal practitioners, and the public as they determine the role that pretrial diversion should play in criminal justice reform efforts and in the provision of mental healthcare.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing popularity of pretrial diversion programs across the U.S., little sociological research has yet examined their impacts. This research draws on national and local datasets, document analysis, an original survey experiment, participant observation, and interviews with attorneys, defendants, and therapists to illuminate the consequences of diversion nationally and to explore variation between programs.  Three questions are addressed: 1) how effective diversion is as a tool to promote decarceration; 2) what the implications of diversion are for social inequality; and 3) what effects diversion has on the lives of defendants.  Findings will contribute to scholarship on contemporary U.S. criminal justice system reform and on the consequences of using the court system to provide mental health treatment. In addition, this research will provide empirical information to jurisdictions seeking to expand diversionary options or to design new programs, to policymakers in search of effective criminal justice alternatives, and to groups involved in advocating for penal reform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the interplay between governance, communication systems, and mechanical infrastructures is a critical part of developing and managing urban spaces. This study, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirical data collection and analysis, traces connections between the built environments of roads, the social lives of users, and the processes of negotiation they engage in. By revealing unexpected ways in which infrastructures function, this research will contribute to broader discussions among urban planners, municipal bodies, and other institutions invested in the governance of urban spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neha Dhole, under the supervision of Dr. Laura Brown of the University of Pittsburgh, will explore the relationship between models of social distance and urban infrastructures in planned landscapes. In many cities, roads and surrounding spaces are used in ways that are rarely recognized by municipal bodies. They are places where people sleep, sell food, park vehicles, post advertisements, and engage in other forms of connection and contestation that shape urban life. This research examines debates among residents, workers, municipal bodies, and other state authorities over the care of roads in New Delhi, India, an appropriate laboratory for asking such questions because of its pilot of a participatory urban development project. The project focuses on one of several neighborhoods planned and built by the Delhi Development Authority to promote secularism and equality among dwellers. Drawing on interviews with residents, street vendors, domestic workers, technical experts, and bureaucrats, along with observation of interactions among them through face-to-face conversations, online exchanges, petitions, and newsletters, the study will examine the link between material infrastructure of roads and conversations, institutions, and forms of sociality. The project will combine analytic models from anthropology, sociolinguistics, and urban planning to better understand the enmeshment of roads and other communication networks. Results will be useful in framing and evaluating participatory governance systems, particularly in thinking through how social media can shape decision-making processes at the local, municipal, and national levels. More broadly, the study will map shifting connections between religion, class, and public spaces in India and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Heng,,Xu,heng.xu@ufl.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities,07/01/2018,08/31/2023,361201.00,"Concerns about a reproducibility crisis in scientific research have become increasingly prevalent within the academic community and to the public at large.  The field of meta-science, which performs the scientific study of science itself, is thriving and has examined the existence and prevalence of threats to reproducible and robust research.  Most existing replication efforts in social sciences, however, have focused on studies using data from statistically rigorous designed surveys or experiments. Largely missing are replication efforts devoted to examining those studies with organic data, including data organically generated by ubiquitous sensors or mobile applications, twitter feeds, click streams, etc.  This project examines the inconsistent handling practices of organic data among scholarly publications in social sciences, in order to establish the confidence (or the lack thereof) in the conclusions drawn from such data analysis.  Since findings of social and behavioral sciences inform policy makers on a wide variety of issues, from homeland security to national economy, establishing the confidence of these findings is critical for the proper usage of them, and therefore has broader impacts on all these application areas of national priority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project starts with determining the extent of, causes of, and remedies for empirical research using organic data that are neither reproducible nor generalizable.  The findings from this step raise awareness about the standards and tools for collecting, cleaning, and processing organic data sets across many fields of social sciences. In addition, this project develops new analytical frameworks and methodologies useful for evaluating replicability and robustness of empirical studies with organic data. The vision is for such frameworks to be broadly used in many application domains, thereby fostering cultural change across different fields in social sciences, and bringing the value of reproducibility and robustness to the forefront of data intensive research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying generalities in the factors that confer vulnerability or resilience to species based on their innate characteristics (their species traits) and where they naturally occur (their geography or spatial traits) in relation to threats, is the intellectual contribution of this project and to geography and the spatial sciences. Results from this study permit a prioritization of species and ecosystems and identify locations for management and conservation of plant diversity. This project will be conducted at the University of California Riverside (UCR), a Hispanic-serving institution located in one of the most socio-economically and culturally diverse regions in the United States. The PIs will leverage existing STEM education initiatives at UCR to engage undergraduates in local K-12 classrooms through the CalTeach program, where they will introduce spatial science and models as a framework for understanding geographic concepts, ecological principles and pressing conservation issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vulnerability of a plant species to threat depends on their distribution (biogeography) in relation to these threats, as well as their species traits. Plants may be long or short lived (redwood trees versus poppies), escape habitat fragmentation and loss because their ecological niche places them in locations undesirable for development, or they may have traits that allow them to recover their populations following fire (fire-stimulated seed germination, or resprouting from underground parts). In a changing environment, plants can only move (migrate) away from threats intergenerationally, mainly via seed dispersal. This project identifies the general aspects of spatial traits (biogeography) versus species traits that confer more or less vulnerability to plants under global change in the coming century as human populations grow and land-use changes. The PIs use simulation modeling to project the population growth or decline for a wide range of plant species that differ in their disturbance-response and other species traits (life form: trees, shrubs, herbs; fire-response; and morphological traits) and their biogeography (coastal, mountain and desert distributions) to identify generalities regarding their vulnerability to threats. They develop and use statistical models of spatially explicit fire risk and species biogeography using modern regression and machine learning methods and use those models to project spatially explicit changes under different land-use and environmental scenarios. The PIs construct plant population models using data from the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and will extract species traits from the TRY Plant Trait Database. This project focuses on the biodiversity of the California Floristic Province, but trends identified will be broadly relevant throughout the entire western U.S. where water-limited ecosystems are strongly impacted by increasing environmental variability and increasing wildfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most research on human skeletal variation has focused on comparing bone structure among geographically, genetically, and behaviorally diverse human groups. In order to understand the influence of behavior and mobility on human bone structure, this doctoral dissertation project will quantify skeletal variation among human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct. This research integrates archaeological evidence of human behavior and microcomputed tomography data to investigate bone structure as an intersection between behavior and biology. Low bone mass related health complications are a prominent expense within the U.S. healthcare system; this project will provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the risk of low bone mass related health issues from an anthropological perspective. The project will also contribute to the development educator workshops for using publicly available 3D image data for classroom-based research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work has found that human groups with higher levels of activity tend to have more robust cortical and trabecular bone structure compared to groups with relatively lower activity levels. However, much of this research has relied on comparing geographically and genetically distinct human groups. This project investigates the relationship between cortical and trabecular bone structural variation across several post-cranial elements within and between human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct in order to test whether the relationship between behavior and bone structure is maintained, or if other factors such as diet, genetic background, and environment play a larger role in forming adult skeletal phenotype than previously considered. Microcomputed tomography scan data of the humerus, cervical vertebra, femur, tibia, talus, and calcaneus will be collected. Cortical and trabecular bone structural variation will be quantified and compared between groups with different subsistence strategies including foragers, horticulturalists, and intensive agriculturalists. Additionally, the amount of variation in cortical and trabecular bone will be investigated within and between both individuals and skeletal elements in order to understand how different levels of bone structural organization respond to variation in subsistence strategy and mechanical loading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether on the basis of gender, ethnicity, age or other markers, group-based differences in how people treat others are known to arise even when social group information is irrelevant and even when people explicitly reject social stereotypes. Despite progress in documenting these disparities, much remains unknown about their origins. The current research focuses on the role of individual human decision-making in producing societal-level outcomes. Specifically, the investigators aim to leverage complementary strengths of behavioral economics, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to uncover systematic patterns of individual human decision-making that, in aggregate, contribute to societal treatment disparities. The primary goal is to characterize the origins of unequal treatment with sufficient precision to support accurate, context-specific predictions of how people will treat members of different social groups. Support for this collaborative effort broadens access to training opportunities for aspiring scientists, provides opportunities for scientific outreach to local communities, and ultimately contributes scientific understanding of societal disparities, with implications for efforts to measure and address discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial progress has been made in documenting the existence of treatment disparities in the world. Separately, substantial progress has been made in in understanding how people think about different social groups in the laboratory. However, given the multitude of ways in which people can be categorized, and the complexity of factors influencing people's social behavior, it has been challenging to construct models of social thought and behavior that are capable of linking laboratory insights to field observations. The current research aims to connect these efforts to produce accurate predictions about when and how members of particular groups will be (dis)advantaged. Specifically, building upon evidence from cognitive neuroscience that valuation and social cognition engage separable but interacting systems, the research uses computational modeling to formally integrate psychological frameworks of how people see others (social perception) with behavioral economic accounts of how people value others' outcomes (social valuation). It then uses those models to predict how people will treat members of different social groups in laboratory and field settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Douglas Massey at Princeton University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the relation between migration and mobility. While extensive research explores patterns of migration and immigrant incorporation in the United States, comparatively little is known about the reintegration of those who return. This project investigates return migrants labor market reintegration and repeat migration behavior. This study will guide policymakers in sending and receiving countries as they seek to monitor international migration and facilitate returnees' labor market reincorporation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses four broad questions: First, what are the most common labor market trajectories among return migrants? Second, why do some return migrants achieve upward mobility while others drift to the margins of the unregulated economy? Third, how does return migrants' labor market reintegration affect their risk of subsequent internal or international migrations? Fourth, how do return migrants' labor market trajectories and migration behaviors vary across time and space? To address the stated questions, the PI will 1) use sequence analysis to identify distinct labor market trajectories among return migrants; 2) fit hazard models with competing risks to predict entry into different labor market trajectories; 3) test the association between returnees' labor market trajectories and their socioeconomic status - income and wealth; 4) fit multinomial logistic regression models to assess the effect of return migrants' labor market trajectories on the odds of re-migrating to the United States or migrating internally; 5) use stratified models and interaction terms to assess changes in labor market reintegration and repeat migration across time and space. This study makes four contributions to research on international migration and economic mobility. First, using sequence analysis, the PI will map return migrants' heterogeneous labor market experiences. Second, using these trajectories, the PI will determine how theoretical expectations match return migrants' observed labor market experiences. Third, this project advances knowledge about the perpetuation of international migration by examining the relation between labor market reintegration and the odds of repeat or internal migration. Fourth, this project investigates how time and space in turn shape return migrants' labor market trajectories and repeat migration behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Daniel,,Parker,dparker@wm.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,04/01/2019,11/30/2022,223752.00,"Our ability to use and understand language in everyday conversation is a feat that seems to be accomplished both rapidly and effortlessly. Just as the impression that our visual interpretation of the world around us is robust and complete, our impression of language is similarly rich. Behind the perceived ease of language understanding is a complex set of neuro-cognitive mechanisms that must work in tandem to give us a rich linguistic experience. However, these systems are not always foolproof and can be misled, arriving at unintended interpretations or the perception of ill-formed sentences as if they were well-formed. These errors trigger what are known as ""linguistic illusions"", and just as visual illusions have transformed our understanding of how our visual system interprets the world around us, the systematic study of linguistic illusions can transform our understanding of how we interpret language. Importantly, by studying the conditions under which we do and do not fall for linguistic illusions, we can improve language technologies, provide better language learning instruction, and aid in assessments of cognitive impairments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to better understand the scope and cause of linguistic illusions. Current language processing models assume that illusions are the product of two distinct cognitive systems: one system for fast, efficient communication (the 'parser'), and another, slower system that classifies grammaticality (the 'grammar'). A competing account claims that illusions reflect a single grammar system embedded in a noisy cognitive architecture that creates the opportunity for errors. The current project addresses this debate by extending research to a broader set of linguistic phenomena using behavioral and computational methods to better understand the exact conditions that trigger illusions. This project will inform our understanding of (i) the cognitive architecture of language, (ii) the mental mechanisms for encoding, accessing, and manipulating sentence structures, and (iii) the role of the grammar in sentence processing. The project will have a direct impact on the broader scientific community, the undergraduate researchers funded through project, and the general public. Specifically, the project will expand the pool of participants that are typically included in psycholinguistic studies to non-college students, leading to a more comprehensive study of linguistic abilities across populations, and will bridge research and education by providing meaningful research experiences to undergraduate researchers, including under-represented minorities, through undergraduate training boot camps, research assistantships, and outreach activities at K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Incarceration not only isolates adolescents from typical sources of socialization (e.g., family, friends, mentors, teachers, coaches) and increases exposure to antisocial influences (e.g., fellow inmates), but also reduces adolescents' opportunities to engage in traditional social interactions. This research examines the effects of juvenile incarceration on adolescents' social development and social relationship quality. Further, the study will explore potential ripple effects that such disruptions to social functioning may have on adolescents' mental health and future offending. The information garnered from this study may inform changes to juvenile justice policies and juvenile incarceration practices to reduce negative effects of incarceration on social development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of a longitudinal study of approximately 300 adolescents (13-17 years) across a period of two years. This sample will consist of three distinct groups of adolescents: 1) incarcerated adolescents, 2) adjudicated adolescents sentenced to community probation, and 3) community adolescents with no prior arrests. Participants will be statistically matched across the three groups on variables associated with incarceration (e.g., age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, prior behavior) to allow for inferences to be made about group-level differences in social development, relationship quality, mental health symptoms, and offending behavior, controlling for pre-existing differences on matched constructs. Participants will complete 7 structured interviews and five weeks of daily diary assessments about their social competence, social relationships, mental health symptoms, and criminal offending behavior.

By 2025, that number is expected to climb to 440 million households, representing 1.6 billion people.  This interdisciplinary research project will analyze the ramifications of accelerating urbanization and rising housing costs in global perspective.  By focusing on several major cities that are responding to affordable housing shortages in different ways, this project will provide new understanding regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of different government policies.  The research team will generate new data and analyses about processes of global urbanization, the relationship between housing and poverty, and the large-scale environmental impact of expanding cities.  The project will produce policy-relevant findings regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of various strategies, policies, and responses.  The researchers will document how the development of certain ideas and laws helped to contribute to the current crisis, which will provide lessons for planners and other decision makers.  The project also will catalogue the human costs of the crisis and record how housing policies work on a day-to-day basis, offering policy makers new insights into the complex nature of the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through their analysis of four cities on four different continents (New York in the U.S., London in the United Kingdom, Lagos in Nigeria, and Delhi in India), the investigators will identify key sources of the global affordable housing crisis by exploring the historical record, present-day strategies of housing provision, and a range of social and environmental transformations taking place in territories far removed from the city.  They will document multiple consequences of the affordable housing crisis, including historical processes of dispossession and land enclosure, present-day survival strategies of low-income families in high-cost cities, and broader trends of accelerated urbanization.  They also will assess why cities have responded to the affordable housing crisis in vastly different ways as well as the consequences of those varied responses for low-income families, cities, and surrounding environments.  The investigators will analyze infrastructure and property relations, urban poverty and housing market dynamics, migration patterns, and flows of capital and other resources.  Historical geoparsing algorithms will analyze a large textual database of archival sources that document the worldwide contestation of property rights in the 20th century.  Ethnographic fieldwork in the four focal cities will document the everyday lives of low-income residents and analyze how different housing policies play out on the ground level.

This project will compare these measures of data quality and costs in VM and VS interviews carried out by the same professional interviewers and in conventional online (textual) self-administered questionnaires, asking the same survey questions to members of a representative sample who are randomly assigned to one of these three modes. Because VM is synchronous and ""live"" like face-to-face (FTF) interviewing, and VS is asynchronous and recorded but still projects a human face, the project's comparisons will provide new insights regarding how these decomposable aspects of human contact affect behavior and experience in surveys. The project's results will reveal the extent to which, and for whom, less costly interaction (live but remote vs. recorded) with an interviewer promotes engagement and data quality comparable to what is found in similar FTF interviews. More generally, the findings will address when and in what ways modern communication modes that reduce social presence and are less personal might be equal to or even more effective than FTF interaction. Findings from this project will provide valuable information relevant to the future of survey measurement and will be of interest to survey researchers in the Federal statistical system and other survey organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even as survey data continue to be central to public policy and decision-making, survey measurement is challenged by declining response rates, increasing costs, declining trust in survey organizations, and rapidly changing communication habits among the public.  Understanding how video technologies could fit into the future of survey data collection is important both because it may meet potential respondents ""where they live"" and because it may provide a significantly lower cost alternative to FTF interviewing. There is even the potential to reach some members of the public whose location makes FTF interviewing difficult or expensive, but who may well be able to participate in a video interview (e.g., people who live in remote rural areas or members of the military deployed overseas).  In comparing data quality across these three survey modes, the project will quantify participation rates, connectivity problems, respondent compliance with the video interviewing protocol, conscientious responding (giving precise answers to numerical questions, thoughtfully differentiating answers), and disclosure of sensitive information. The project will measure the potential impact of individual interviewers, feelings of engagement with the interview, rapport with the interviewer, and respondent satisfaction. The project also will allow assessment of data collection costs across these modes.  Access to and use of video technologies are not universal, and even among those with access some are willing to engage in video interaction while others are reluctant.

It does so by providing free or subsidized transportation to a selected group of low income mothers and comparing their labor market efforts and outcomes to low income mothers who do not receive transport subsidy.  The research will answer two specific questions: (i) will providing subsidized ride-hailing services to the poor enable better access to employment, training, and social services?  (ii) will subsidized transportation raise labor force participation and generate benefits that outweigh the costs?  Low-skilled workers in urban America are often concentrated in areas that are far from jobs that match their skills. The high cost of transportation poses special problems for low-income mothers with children, given their child care responsibilities making it difficult and costly for them to find jobs if they rely on public transportation.  New technology that makes ride-hailing, such as those provided by UBER and LYFT, possible offers flexible, convenient, and relatively inexpensive transportation that does not require private car ownership.  The results of this research will help increase labor market participation and employment of low-income mothers, thus improving the living standards of these mothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will empirically test the hypothesis that reducing transportation cost to low income mothers will increase their labor market participation and employment, using a large-scale randomized control trial (RCT).  Leveraging the emergence of ride-hailing as a new transportation option, the PIs will provide free rides to the treatment group of low-income mothers and compare employment and other outcomes to a demographically equivalent control group.   The PIs will work in partnership with UBER technologies and will exploit the diffusion of smartphones among the poor to track the impact of lower transportation costs on employment and wages.  GPS technology will also be extensively used to track the mobility of participants as they travel to search for, and go to work.  In addition to self-reported data collected from participants, the PIs will use data collected by local governments to supplement the research efforts.

Such rapid changes to the labor market underscore the importance of considering innovative programs that provide financial protection to displaced workers. Wage insurance is one approach that provides both compensation for job loss and incentives to return to work. As part of the Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance program, displaced workers receive up to half of the difference in wages between their old job and their new job for up to two years. The project examines how this policy influences labor market outcomes. The research specifically focuses on the amount of time people remain unemployed and their wages upon returning to work. The research, thus, is useful in exploring wage insurance as a potential alternative to standard unemployment insurance systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Under Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA), workers over age 50 who lose their job to import competition can receive up to half of the difference in their pre-displacement and post-displacement earnings (""wage insurance""). The research uses a regression-discontinuity (RD) design based on eligibility age to estimate the causal effect of this program on labor market outcomes. Merging administrative data on trade-displaced workers with nationally representative employer-employee linked data, the project looks at the long-run effects of wage insurance on re-employment wages, unemployment durations, wage growth, and occupational quality over time at the national level. The RD estimates are used in connection with a sufficient-statistics framework to evaluate welfare effects. Workers receiving wage insurance payments may smooth consumption while accumulating human capital in a new industry or occupation. The program may, however, generate moral hazard by incentivizing workers to take lower-paying, less demanding jobs, because part of their lost wages are covered by insurance. The model quantifies the magnitude of these two effects. The project advances our understanding of wage insurance as an alternative to unemployment insurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research then considers efficient macroeconomic policy from this perspective. This research is highly relevant in the recent low interest rate environment, as monetary policy has historically been the most direct tool to prevent severe risk-markets shocks from spilling over to the real economy. When interest rates are low, traditional policies are ineffective. Furthermore, a low interest rate environment encourages speculative bubbles and high yield investment patterns that make the economy more vulnerable. These phenomena and policy responses to them impact the global economy and require an internationally coordinated response. This research will generate new analytical tools to integrate financial and macroeconomic analysis. It will also explore optimal policy responses to macroeconomic outcomes by considering the impact of risk-market imbalances on the real economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the interactions between risk-shocks and constraints on monetary policy in generating economic fluctuations, the role of financial speculation and its drivers in exacerbating the severity of these fluctuations, and the optimal joint monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policy framework for this environment. Specifically, the research examines risk-off episodes with a zero-lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates that incorporates a broader set of constraints, including political economy concerns. The research will also explore, both theoretically and empirically, the role of leverage and how it responds to different policy frameworks. The project further incorporates speculative bubbles and behavioral elements in this framework.

Previous research suggests that decisions about weapons technologies are driven mainly by security concerns or financial needs, but such factors cannot explain current patterns of weapons development across nations. This project will instead test the theory that the ways in which those involved in war and weapons development in each nation (i.e. military personnel, scientists, private firms, etc.) conceptualize future warfare shapes the kinds of weapons that they seek to design and procure. This theory will be tested in relation to the development and procurement of aircraft carriers, stealth technology, and autonomous weapons in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and India. Data for testing the theory will come from analyses of military documents in national archives, in-depth interviews with key figures in each nation, and a survey experiment designed to uncover how decisions are made regarding military budgets and weapons procurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-method investigation of how and why nation states decide to create and procure different types of weapons technologies. It focuses on interactions among military personnel, politicians, scientists, private firms, and civil society organizations. The main contention is that these actors' conceptions of future warfare shape their choices about weapons procurement. Thus, each set of actors' identity, belief about the state of future conflict, and receptiveness to and interpretation of the laws and ethics of warfare shape the technical solutions that they will propose to different types of security threats. The extent to which these technological solutions are then transformed into weapons systems is predicted to be determined by the extent to which each set of actors has access to the decision-making process and the extent to which their ideas resonate with those of decision makers. The predicted result of interplay among these factors is that even when faced with similar threats, states end up making different choices regarding weapons procurement. This theory of weapons technology design and procurement will be tested by comparing archival, interview, and experimental data from the United States, United Kingdom, France, and India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the finding that specific diseases vary in prevalence across populations has given rise to questions and concerns that extend beyond the biological.  These are such questions as, Will diagnosis become the impetus for discrimination in the funding of research or the availability of treatment? Could an association between diseases and sub-populations become a tool for political organizing or social and cultural differentiation? The anthropological research supported by this award will investigate these issues through a focus on sickle cell disease, a group of blood disorders that affects the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Sickle cell is the most common genetic disease worldwide and affects as many as 100,000 Americans. Because sickle cell is also uneven in its distribution, it is an appropriate domain for investigating concerns about changing understandings of the relationship between genes and social life. Genetic diseases increasingly dominate the landscape of biomedicine worldwide, and this project will help to understand the socio-political implications of these shifts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Cornell University anthropology doctoral student, Rebekah Ciribassi, with guidance from Dr. Stacey Langwick. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research in Tanzania, because it has one of the world's highest rates of children born with sickle cell disease. Because sickle cell in Tanzania is at the center of a growing network of infrastructure, advocacy, research, and care, including widespread testing, the disease is discussed widely in the public forum, which will make any socio-political relationships easier to uncover and track over time than would be the case where the disease is less common or less talked about. The researcher has identified two areas of the country, Mwanza and Zanzibar, where people are grappling with sickle cell disease but where the political, racial, and social histories through which they make sense of an inherited disease are very different. This funding is for the second phase of the research, the component to be carried out in Zanzibar. The investigators will gather data from (1) medical practitioners who work in sickle cell disease care in a hospital setting; (2) sickle cell advocacy group participants; and (3) diagnosed families. She will employ a mix-method social science approach including: archival and discourse analysis; participant observation in hospital clinics; and interviews and life history interviews with diagnosed families. The investigators will build a comparison between the data collected in the Zanzibari context and the data collected in Mwanza, with special  attention to emergent themes around blood; kinship (e.g., inheritance and reproduction); race and ethnicity; and nation. The resulting analysis will assess how genetic medicine integrates with extra-clinical contexts.

The project synthesizes data from archives, public policy documents, and interviews with stakeholders to understand how biological difference comes to be constructed as an object of scientific and medical inquiry that is knowable by certain experts who are granted legitimacy as knowledge-producers, while other accounts are denied institutional support. In doing so it advances literature in science and technology studies on the intersection of gender roles and regulatory interventions and on the influence of gender ideology on the work of scientific researchers and medical practitioners.

However, for the roughly 200,000 young children in the US with a visual or hearing disability, language learning proceeds differently, and there are basic questions about the roles of hearing and seeing in language development for which we have no answers. Discovering answers to these questions is critical for supporting individuals with hearing or vision impairments, and those with language delays or deficits, and also for improving the health and educational outcomes of all children.  Children who are deaf or hard of hearing and do not receive sign language input or assistive technology (e.g., cochlear implants) show large delays in acquiring language skills. When such children learn sign language through normal visual modality, though, they appear to develop normal language abilities.  This suggests that vision can provide a ""path"" to language.  At the same time, other evidence indicates that vision is not strictly necessary for learners with normal hearing, as blind adults have largely normal language. Indeed, these individuals learn color and vision-related words (""see"") similarly to sighted peers.  Neurologically, their 'language' brain areas work quite similarly, whereas 'vision' areas reorganize. Unlike deaf infants who receive cochlear implants or sign language input, individuals who are blind do not generally receive (nor appear to require) additional input to support language. This is despite the fact that, in typical development, visual experiences have been linked to language learning (e.g. seeing where parents are looking or pointing).  This project seeks to provide critical evidence concerning how the brain rewires when infants are born unable to hear or to see, and how early brain development enables language acquisition. This project also has two educational objectives that will increase science knowledge among the lay public and schoolchildren, while building the communication, research, and pedagogical skills of tomorrow's scientists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Across five studies, this project will examine the knowledge and processing of language in infants who are blind, deaf/hard of hearing, or typically-developing. Given that infants understand words months before producing them, this work focuses on early word comprehension, particularly on words' sounds and meanings, using behavioral, neural, and observational approaches.  Real-time language processing will be measured by tracking eye movements and brain waves in response to language stimuli. In another studies, word learning will be tracked through the analysis of naturalistic recordings of parent-child interactions. Together, the results of these approaches will provide critical insights into how children learn and grow with the types of language input they receive, as well as how to improve language learning in special populations. The educational component of this project includes a multi-tiered research communication plan, along with a set of after-school enrichment activities for local K-2nd graders.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the psychology of how situations shape police officers' decisions and actions when interacting with community residents in the field. Police officers' core role competencies require them to maintain control, and also to maintain their own legitimacy, during interactions with residents that can be challenging for everyone involved. This project investigates how chronic situations within American patrol policing impacts core role competencies, and subsequent decisions to use force. This project expands and refines scientific theories of when, how, and for whom status and identity correspond with aggression and violence. This research also seeks to benefit society through its findings, contact with officers and residents, and mentorship of undergraduate research scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how situational vulnerabilities, social status, and social identity predict the per-interaction rate of force in officer-resident interactions.

This approach enables the investigators to test relationships between situational vulnerabilities and use of force, with situational factors as moderators. To understand the chronic situations of policing from community residents' perspectives, the investigators will also conduct representative surveys of residents in three U.S. cities. These methods also enable controls for neighborhood-level factors, including arrest rates, racial segregation, and income inequality. Together, these studies begin to design a science of chronic situations in powerful institutions within embedded, dynamic social contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Tonia Poteat at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist researching the cultural geography of rural HIV/AIDS disparities. Not enough is yet known about spatial and cultural identities in relation to health disparities beyond clinical descriptors. To address this issue, leading HIV/AIDS disparity researchers call for work that employs narrative and community-focused approaches. This project employs such approaches to consider the ways HIV/AIDS disparities are negotiated in communities. By focusing on narratives, this project investigates the contours and functions of rural communities related to health inequity. <br/><br/>This project aims to provide critical insight into how oral histories contextualize and mobilize spatial knowledge of HIV/AIDS' impact on the community and social experiences in the United States. It uses (1) research review, (2) oral history interviewing, and (3) field observation. Research review involves weighing how previously published literature in the creative writing and humanistic studies offer narratives similar to oral history that relay personal and community responses to HIV/AIDS disparity. Such research review is designed to inform public health methodology and improve understandings of HIV/AIDS disparity in cultural terms. Fieldwork for the project involves collecting a series of oral history interviews and conducting field observations to weigh the pertinent potential of humanistic narratives as primary data. In particular, interviews focus on how the impact of HIV/AIDS from the 1980s to now has altered individual's relationships to their rural communities as well as the ways collective social environments have formed. This study will ultimately foster improved understandings of the social terrain of HIV disparity from the points-of-views of those affected by it in order to potentiate more catered, place-specific interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, overdose deaths now claim three to four times more American lives each year than homicide and more deaths annually than the AIDS epidemic did at its peak.  Although the drug overdose crisis has affected people across all locations and walks of life, research shows that this illegal drug epidemic is concentrated in some communities and demographic groups but not others.  Little research has been conducted, however, on why some places and populations are more vulnerable to experiencing drug overdoses.  In addition, little is known about whether the community sources of fatal drug overdoses are the same as those that shape homicide and suicide rates.  This project will address these questions by identifying the community characteristics that contribute to drug overdose death concentrations across locales, time, and demographic groups, both alone and compared to the community sources of homicide and suicide.  In so doing, this project provides one of the most comprehensive, nationwide analyses examining the community-level sources of drug overdose deaths to date.  It also will equip researchers and policy makers with information that can be used to combat the drug overdose epidemic by targeting community-level conditions for intervention and assisting those places and groups that are most susceptible to drug overdose concentrations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will compile a unique database using approximately 25 years of nationally-representative mortality data on overdose deaths, homicides, and suicides drawn from the Center for Disease Control Restricted-Access Multiple Cause of Death Mortality data from 1990 to 2016.  These data will be aggregated and combined with measures of community social, economic, and health indicators drawn from multiple databases including: the U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Disease Control prescription data, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation community health data.  Using fixed effects change-score models, these combined data will be used to identify the community sources of overdose death rates across: (1) aggregate study units (e.g., county, metropolitan areas); (2) time (1990-2016); (3) substance type (heroin, natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids, cocaine, psychostimulants); and (4) demographic groups (race/ethnicity, age, gender).  These analyses will be replicated for both homicide and suicide to identify whether the community-level determinants of death are unique for each form of mortality, or whether there are common factors that similarly predict overdose, homicide, and suicide death rates.  Hybrid time series models will also be used to address limitations of fixed effects modeling.  Findings from this project will contribute to greater understanding of ecological theories of crime by testing relevant hypotheses using dependent variables reflecting drug overdose, homicide, and suicide rates, which include outcomes previously understudied within this theoretical framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Rui,,Diogo,rui.diogo@howard.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2019,03/31/2025,484607.00,"One of the major questions in biology is how small genotypic differences can underpin striking phenotypic differences in anatomy, physiology, development, and behavior, like those seen between humans and apes. Indeed, we share nearly 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, our closest living ape relatives, despite having substantially different appearances and behaviors. In order to study these genotype-phenotype relationships across humans and apes, detailed phenotypic data, including anatomical data, are needed. However, despite a fascination about apes that is shared by many scientists and the broader public, there are very limited resources for accessing and exploring ape anatomy. This project will develop a comprehensive, user-friendly and freely available resource on ape anatomy, the Visible Ape Project (VAP). This website and mobile/tablet app anatomical resource will be hosted at Howard University, to assure long-term availability and visibility of the data and support STEM research and scientific dissemination at a Historically Black University (HBCU). The VAP will serve as a valuable cross-disciplinary resource and create interdisciplinary connections between medical/veterinary education and biological anthropology. The VAP will also support public interest in science, drawing further attention to and awareness of apes, whose continued existence in the wild is seriously threatened. A number of outreach activities, including US and internationally-collaborative workshops, educational, and conservation activities, will reach the public, students from the high school level through graduate levels, and researchers and medical/veterinary practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the way that GenBank has been transformative for genetic research, the VAP is a major step towards transforming the 'phenome' in terms of providing a resource with comprehensive image data of ape anatomy directly comparable to human anatomy. In particular, the VAP and its comparisons with the Visible Human Project will allow researchers to address fundamental questions about the genomic, developmental, evolutionary and functional bases of human and ape anatomy and development, the origin and variations of the human body, and the features that make humans unique. Specifically, the VAP will include about 1,050 labeled images (dissection photographs, 3D photogrammetry, anatomical illustrations, CT/MRI scans) and 3D models of neonates and adults of each major ape group, as well as more than 250 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled full body and brain serial sections of both neonatal and adult chimps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, social stratification, urbanization, extensive intra- and interregional trade networks, and population movement and densification are notable features of this period.  While archaeological investigations have bolstered understanding of each of these aspects, bioarchaeological investigations are in a unique position through the use of human remains to address questions of population interaction, social organization, and community formation.  This research will investigate the complex interaction between population density, population diversity, and culture contact in the development of incipient urbanization, migration, and the production of community identities.  Such research has modern-day implications regarding the human response to population density and diversity, urban and neighborhood development, migration, and inter-population interaction.  International collaboration will be fostered between several institutions in both the United States and Turkey.  This project will also contribute to the training of an undergraduate student in bioarchaeological and statistical skills and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in biological anthropology.  Results from this research will be shared through publication in several academic journals, international and domestic lectures, and data will be shared in the digital data repository, ScholarWorks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine the community formation practices and demographic processes of EBA Anatolia using the site Karata-Semay (c. 2800-2300 BCE) in southwestern Anatolia.

Utilizing dental metric and morphological data collected on both permanent and deciduous dentitions, this research will conduct intra- and inter-site analyses to investigate biological relatedness between individuals and sites, respectively.  Such analyses contribute to understanding of the social organization of individuals within a single community; postmarital residence practices; kinship construction; extent of biological and, by proxy, cultural diversity; and region of origin.  This information, in conjunction with archaeological and mortuary data, will be used to identify how early settlements developed and how individuals negotiated common community identities and formed social units.

To the extent our limited capacity for information processing capacity is a major source of such errors, better understanding of cognitive processes will yield more effective methods for predicting and reducing the poor decisions that put workers at risk. Accordingly, this study will complete a series of eye-tracking experiments to build an error-detection framework - the Human-Error Detection Framework - that computes the likelihood of human error in occupational settings to enable proactive countermeasures to keep workers safe. Subsequently, to extend the value of this framework, this project will enrich and expand research-based educational materials, outreach, and engagement activities to spread awareness about this framework to communities and workers. To achieve these goals, this multidisciplinary project blends research linking eye movements and worker' attention with research focused on working-memory load and decision making in order to discover how and why workers in dynamic work environments fail to detect, comprehend, and/or respond to physical risks. Using the dynamic and high-risk environment of construction as a testbed, the proposed framework will connect eye movements and cognitive manipulations in laboratory and field experiments with worker demographics to identify precursors that predict accident-causing human errors in dynamic worksites. In all, this project will demonstrate the value and effectiveness of synthesizing cognitive psychology, engineering, and advanced computation to improve decision making and occupational safety.&lt;br/&gt;The Human-Error Detection Framework will harness real-time eye-movement patterns to identify human errors and thereby lay the foundation for synthesizing technology with data analysis to automatically identify and interrupt human decision-making errors before injuries occur. Using the predictive models resulting from this study will not only contribute to significant accident reduction but will also provide a critical validation measure to confirm the effectiveness of training programs in enhancing workers? risk-analysis skills. Furthermore, since this project provides tools and insights for researchers, students, and workers to use to enhance occupational safety and multidisciplinary research, this project will evolve the broader pedagogical landscape of the decision, risk, and management sector. As this innovative research challenges the conventional, reactionary paradigm of safety-risk management by enabling the identification of at-risk workers using a measurable indicator of their cognitive processes?i.e., their eye movements, the proposed proactive approach to occupational safety has the potential for averting occupational accidents across industries and thereby will foreseeably prevent the injuries that undermine the well-being of millions of American workers and their families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These people are the first source of information as children begin to learn about human behavior and social norms shaping that behavior. The goal of this study is to examine how contextual factors influence the manner in which children interpret the behavioral intentions of others.  With a focus on social-cognitive development, this study addresses how children learn about the goals and desires of others and how children learn about the rules and norms of various social groups. In this global age, individuals are increasingly required to understand multiple worldviews. This study will foster skills needed to promote positive social behaviors and sensitivity to the norms and values of different cultural groups in the United States, which, in turn, will reduce harmful stereotyping and misunderstandings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the perspectives, norms, and conventions of various individuals will help children develop a better understanding of their own place in the social world. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the process by which children acquire this understanding.  The study also examines cultural differences and similarities in how children interpret intentional actions over the first five years of life. This will be accomplished by tracking emerging developmental changes in understandings of personal and social causes of intentional action at three time points starting in infancy and continuing on to the preschool years. Two cultural groups will be compared: European- and Chinese-Americans. The study also involves examining how infants, toddlers, and preschoolers employ statistical learning mechanisms in interpreting behavior.  The methodological approach consists of a critical third party generalization task; this means that having learned about the behaviors (and intentions) of one person, investigators will determine whether infants and children are able to predict the behaviors (and intentions) of an unfamiliar person.  A statistical learning measure will be used to determine how infants and children across cultures use statistical information to infer goals and desires of individuals. For example, if a young child grows up in a culture in which actions are governed by common cultural norms and practices as opposed to personal preferences, and thus observes consistency across individuals, that child may learn, over time, that observed intentional actions are frequently generalizable across individuals. In contrast, if a young child grows up in a culture in which actions are frequently expressions of idiosyncratic personal tastes, and thus, observes variability across individuals, then, that child may learn over time that intentional actions are not necessarily generalizable across individuals. Three age groups will be assessed: infants (ages 11-13 months), toddlers (ages 28-32 months) and preschoolers (ages 3-5 years).  Central questions posed include: Are children's predictions regarding the intentions of others a function of the sociocultural group to which the children belong?

The objective of this research is to investigate the origins of prehistoric Palauans on a regional scale and subsequent local human mobility within the archipelago following settlement. While linguistic, computer modeling, and biodistance studies have resulted in hypotheses identifying broad general regions of Micronesian population origins, numerous questions regarding the relationship of early Micronesians to other regional populations, and a more specific area of origin still remain. In generating aDNA data for western Micronesia, this project will place early Palauans in a regional framework to examine broader scale genetic relationships. Examination of mobility via strontium (87Sr/ 86Sr) and lead (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) isotope analysis from human remains--in conjunction with biological and geological samples taken from locations across the archipelago--will help to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime and shed light on inter-island mobility during the earliest phases of settlement in Palau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These have included both thoroughgoing legislative reforms and specific banking sector reorganizations. Now, a decade later, the research supported by this award asks an important question: how have these changes affected the day-to-day practices and values of those working in finance?  Unlike most research on finance, this ethnographic project is focused on the local and the micro-processes through which global change must occur. This is a critically important and often missing perspective. In some locales the banking crisis has persisted. Understanding the motivations and activities of those who actually practice finance is a key part of identifying the underpinnings of financial resilience and avoiding future crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Yale University anthropology doctoral student, Theodore Park, with the guidance of Dr. Paul Kockelman. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research in northern Italy because it is one site where the financial crisis has continued, despite targeted legislation, and because Italian reforms are sometimes identified as potential models for reforms in the United States. The researcher will collect data with a comparative research design, focusing on two wealth management firms, one of which has chosen to adopt the reforms and become publicly traded, and one of which has chosen to sustain its earlier identity as a local, private institution. The researcher will focus on the effects of variable institutional structures; the impacts of legislation, particularly the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; and variation in ethical discourse and practices. Study populations will include wealth managers, fund managers, support staff, clients, and family members. Data will be collected through a mix of ethnographic methods including participant observations, semi-structured interviews, life history mappings, surveys, and focus groups. These data will be supplemented with archival research; compilations of relevant legislation; and analyses of media, including manager training materials and social media. Findings from this research will be shared with policy makers, the institutions studied, and the general public. The research also will contribute to improved theory of the social science of financial institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the processes through which robo-advising affects individual decision-making is critical if we are to design advisors to benefit investors through better and tailored advice and to appropriately shape public policy with respect to the use of robo-advising. This project aims to study the effects of adopting robo-advice on the quality of decisions individuals make. The project will further the scientific knowledge about the cognitive and social impact of new technologies in the realm of professional advice to non-experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study the following aspects of the relationship between robo-advising and decision-making under risk: (i) the extent to which robo-advising might correct well-documented behavioral biases in decision-making under risk; (ii) the extent to which robo-advising can improve over that provided by human financial advisers; and (iii) how individual investors' algorithm aversion makes human and robo-advice complementary, in which case robo-advising may increase rather than decrease the scope for human financial advice. To address the first question, the authors will employ several empirical techniques that range from linear regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence semi-parametric methods like boosted regression trees (BRT). For the second question, the authors will analyze the results of a randomized control trial involving the introduction of a tool to relax the attention constraints of financial advisers at a brokerage house. To address the third question, the authors will assess (i) whether, once given the option to access robo-advice, investors access it autonomously or reach out to human advisers for guidance; and (ii) whether, once investors start to use robo-advice, they reduce their reliance on human advisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is part of a larger project that investigates the effects of consumer credit access on several outcomes, including economic growth, consumption and investment, income distribution, intergenerational transmission of wealth and income, and innovation.   The study will be based on an innovative data linkage method that combines personal credit data and Census longitudinal data over longer periods of time.  The researchers will also use an innovative approach to study the mechanisms through which credit access affect several outcomes at the family level as well as the macro level.  This research project deals with a very important subject as credit access has become a very important issue for poverty eradication in the US and the around the world. The results of this research will provide inputs into policies to reduce poverty, close the education gap, increase employment and productivity and economic growth generally.  This study will therefore have important effect on economic growth in the US.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research will use a mix of reduced form and structural estimation strategies to identify the causal impact of family credit access on several outcomes. The first hypothesis is that parental credit access improves child college attendance rates and decreases the amount of debt incurred by the child.  The identification strategy is based on several events that generate exogenous variation in credit access.  This exogenous variation in credit access is then used to look at subsequent student debt, labor market outcomes, and entrepreneurial outcomes of the children (and parents). The project will also use variation across states income cutoffs for bankruptcies, introduced by the 2005 bankruptcy-reform act as one of the instruments for credit access.  Parents just above the cutoff (who cannot discharge debts) should have greater credit access, whereas parents just below the cutoff (who can file for bankruptcy) should have lesser credit access.  The research will also estimate a structural model to obtain micro-elasticity estimates from the reduced form estimates and then conduct counterfactuals to measure the impact of broad economy-wide credit access on individual outcomes.   The results of this research project will provide valuable inputs into policies to reduce poverty and the inter-generational transmission of poverty in the US and globally.  This will help establish the US as the global leader in poverty reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Hiroaki,,Kaido,hkaido@bu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,09/01/2018,08/31/2020,120473.00,"Empirical research in the social sciences often entails estimating and drawing robust inference about optimal values of nonlinear programs. Examples include, but are not limited to, the analysis of causal effects of economic policies; features of the distribution of counterfactual outcomes (e.g. optimal reserve prices and optimal revenues) under weak assumptions; counterfactual vote shares and seats assignments; welfare effects of policy interventions; demand extrapolation and welfare analysis subject to rationality constraints; maximum and minimum responses to monetary policies. This research aims at establishing a general, formal framework and providing a methodology for estimation and robust inference on optimal values of nonlinear programs under weak restrictions on the underlying process that has generated the observable data. Recognizing that the computational feasibility of the method is crucial for its applicability and usefulness for empirical researchers and society more broadly, the investigators deliver algorithms for computation of the proposed estimators and robust confidence intervals. This research also delivers a collection of portable computer programs implementing the methodology that will be shared with the community openly and free of charges or restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims at developing robust inference procedures and computational methods for parameters in econometric models that are characterized as optimal values of nonlinear programs. Making inference on such functionals is nontrivial because subtle features of the underlying optimization problem may affect inference. For example, the optimal solution may not be unique, may be unique but only weakly identified, or may be characterized by intricate constraints. Due to these challenging features, existing methods often impose assumptions such as constraint qualifications on the underlying optimization problem. These are hard to verify in practice. This research aims at developing inference methods that place very little structure on the optimization problem. Further, the project aims at developing and investigating the convergence properties of a computational method that can be used to implement the procedure. Nonlinear programs often involve black-box functions that are computed by simulation or by solving a complex structural model. The algorithm developed in this project, which is based on the response surface method, mitigates the computational cost by constructing flexible approximations to such functions and adaptively drawing evaluation points to regions that are highly relevant for finding the optimal value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This list includes languages that play key roles in the economy and national security of the US such as Chinese and Vietnamese as well as many Native American languages such as Navajo and Cherokee. A better understanding of the linguistic properties of these languages is a meaningful first step in increasing the communication efficiency with speakers of these languages and the development of better learning materials for these languages for native speakers of English. This project investigates the linguistic patterns of tone in two Chinese languages--Mandarin and Taiwanese--using state-of-the-art neurolinguistic techniques to shed light on how words with tones are represented in the speakers' brains. It contributes methodological innovations that will allow the different stages of the production processing of tone to be tracked by neurological measures. Moreover, this project involves international collaboration between a US institution and two prominent neurolinguistic laboratories in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The established connections will provide educational opportunities for students both in the US and internationally.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on tonal alternation patterns whereby a tone takes different phonological forms in different contexts, also known as ""tone sandhi."" Behavioral studies have shown that tone sandhi patterns extend to novel words in different ways, i.e., have different productivity, depending on the phonological nature of the pattern. This suggests that different mechanisms may be involved in the processing of this type of phonological alternation. This project uses event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the time-course of the encoding of a number of tone sandhi patterns in Mandarin and Taiwanese in speech production. It is hypothesized that unproductive sandhi patterns are primarily subserved by a lexical mechanism that engages neural activities in an earlier time window of lexical retrieval (approximately 150-225 ms after the initiation of production), while productive sandhi patterns are primarily subserved by a computation mechanism that engages neural activities in a later time-window of phonological encoding (400-600 ms). It is also hypothesized that the neural activities of the lexical mechanism are sensitive to lexical frequency, while those of the computation mechanism are less so. This project will be the first to investigate the neural activities underlying the putative computation vs. lexical mechanisms associated with productive and unproductive phonological alternations. The increased understanding of the neural encoding of phonological alternation will inform both the theoretical models of speech production and formal models of phonological competence. Findings of this project can also be linked to issues of morphological decompositionality such as regularity and semantic transparency to achieve a fuller understanding of the neural bases of linguistic productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The choice of scale is an important question in the analysis of geospatial data. For example, the spatial analysis of socioeconomic variables at the state level may mask local processes taking place at the county or community level. Historically, spatial and temporal analysis has proceeded either separately or in a loosely coupled research design. This project will develop and extend a multi-scale framework for the visualization and analysis of geospatial data. The framework will resolve fundamental issues of scale handling in data analytics, advance knowledge about cross-scale spatio-temporal phenomena, and aid scientists in looking more deeply into the interplay among various environmental and social processes. New tools will be developed and made publicly available. The utility of these tools will be tested in case studies, including an analysis of wetland habitats in coastal Louisiana and Hawaiian rainfall patterns. The project will support graduate students whose participation will advance their own professional development. The collaboration between the University of Hawaii and the University of Colorado at Boulder will increase geographic diversity and the presence of women and underrepresented minorities in computer science, earth science, and spatial data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop a theoretical framework for multi-scale data representation, modeling, and analysis. Multi-scale analysis of spatio-temporal data is a longstanding concern for analytic systems in many disciplines. The problem of handling scale is epitomized in the well-known modifiable areal unit problem and its temporal equivalent. These issues are partially due to the traditionally held views of time as a linear sequence and space as a flat layer. This project extends research on the Triangular Model (TM), a 2D representation of time, into higher dimensional models. The project will test the utility of TM in analyzing linear spatial data, refine conceptual and computational aspects of a 3D Pyramid Model (PM) for multi-scale spatial analysis, and integrate the TM and PM into an 5D analytical framework for multi-scale spatio-temporal analyses. Topologies, statistics, and machine learning methods will be developed on the models and framework to support multi-scale queries, visualization, and quantitative modeling. The questions to be answered in the project include: 1) what additional knowledge can be gained by analyzing spatio-temporal variations, patterns, and relationships of phenomena across in the TM and PM frameworks? and 2) in what ways can multi-scale representations of spatio-temporal data facilitate the modeling of human-environment interactions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concomitant with the creation of these new roles, however, has been the rise of high-profile controversies around the potential abusive use of big data and of the algorithms whose creation they enable. This project thus focuses on 'data science ethics' and works to understand how to best cultivate a culture of ethics in data science. It will assess the state, structure, and substance of data ethics in both educational and industrial contexts. Within the academic sector, the project will conduct interviews with faculty and undergraduates and analyze relevant syllabi to develop an account of what constitutes data ethics in the academy. Comparing these data across faculty and disciplines will show major areas of agreement and disagreement over what data ethics education should entail. Within the industrial sector, the project will research how data ethics are beginning to figure into corporate practice and study how companies define data ethics and attempt to integrate ethical considerations into everyday work. Data will come from in-depth interviews with those in industry and analyses of corporate documents from companies that have made public commitments to addressing data ethics. The PIs would then compare data and findings from across these two contexts to identify commonalities, differences, and useful strategies for advancing data ethics across social contexts and professional sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will draw together a diverse group of researchers who in collaboration with educators and data science practitioners will: (1) document and assess barriers and opportunities for integrating ethics into data science practice; (2) assess the continuities and discontinuities emerging between industrial and academic contexts; and (3) develop a foundation for cohesive, comprehensive, integrative data ethics education. The investigators will use a range of complementary methods to do so, including qualitative interviews, expert judgement, and quantitative computational analyses of the latent thematic and topical structure of documents from academia and industry.

Prior research has shown that many safety net programs have important positive effects on the health and well-being of those who receive them. Yet, take-up of such programs among the eligible population is incomplete and tends to be dampened by a variety of factors such as stigma, hassle costs, and lack of information. However, particularly among poor, program-eligible Hispanic households, the federal government also plays a major role in their lives through immigration enforcement. Indeed, numerous media accounts have reported that increased vigilance for non-citizens has led individuals who are eligible for enrollment in such programs (e.g. U.S.-born and naturalized citizens) to not sign up or to drop out of government programs. Such behaviors, purportedly driven by fear of ""outing a relative,"" are highly policy relevant and could have important effects for Hispanic and non-Hispanic households alike.  Understanding whether the dual role of federal authority as both enforcer and benefactor influences the take-up of decisions of vulnerable households is critical to developing policies that fulfill the government's mandates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine the staggered roll-out of a relatively novel and far-reaching immigration enforcement program, Secure Communities, which led to a massive increase in detainers and deportations for both violent and non-violent immigrant offenders. Secure Communities provides ideal quasi-experimental variation since the Hispanic community was overwhelmingly affected and the timing of the rollout was based on technical factors, lending itself to a triple difference-in-differences empirical methodology. This approach allows the researchers to compare program take-up for Hispanic households within a given location to take-up for non-Hispanic whites and blacks, net of counties that had not yet activated, versus after Secure Communities activation.  To assess whether any isolated effects on the take-up of programs by Hispanic Americans are mediated by fear of revealing non-citizens in their networks, the researchers have assembled data on the spatial distribution of mixed-status families, survey data on deportation fear, and Google Trends data on searches for deportation-related terms. Lastly, the researchers assess whether the effects of enforcement on take-up are buffeted in areas that have declared sanctuary status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past few decades, medical science has increased the potential uses of human bio-materials. However, as innovation has increased, so have questions about costs, outcomes, and ethics. In response, a variety of different regulatory policies have been adopted globally. This variation across countries provides an excellent opportunity for comparative research to see to what degree policy differences produce different outcomes for donors, recipients, and other stakeholders. In this project, researchers will focus on one area of bio-material donation -- compensated donation of human eggs -- in two different cultural contexts. Results from this research will benefit policy makers, medical professionals, and patient and provider advocates. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by Dr. Diane Tober, a medical anthropologist from the University of California, San Francisco, in collaboration with researchers from the Spanish University of Distance Education and from Complutense University, both in Madrid, Spain. These research sites were chosen because the United States and Spain are the two primary locations for donor egg fertility treatment, but their bio-material markets operate within dramatically different cultural and regulatory environments. The U.S. has comparatively few regulations limiting donor selection, compensation, and identification, while Spain is highly regulated, limits donor compensation, and requires donor anonymity. The researchers will collect data through ethnographic observation in two or more clinics in each country; interviews with medical professionals in the fertility industry and other key informants; and interviews and surveys of women in each country who provide eggs for pay, including both experienced and first-time donors. The quantitative data will be analyzed with standard statistical methods; the qualitative ethnographic data will be examined using computer-assisted qualitative data analytical techniques and through narrative analysis. Results, presented in professional publications and at conferences, will help social scientists understand how underlying cultural logics inform the crafting and regulation of medical markets and the commodification of human bio-materials.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Clancy Blair at New York University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the social skill development of children growing up in environments of socioeconomic adversity. Nearly 20% of children in the United States are being raised in poverty. Impoverished families face a multitude of adversities, such as economic and housing obstacles, as well as difficulties seeking and maintaining employment. Such barriers can produce psychological stress and diminish time for family interactions and children's social skill development. The attainment of appropriate social skills is important for children's development across many areas of functioning, including mental health and academic achievement. Children with poor social skills are at higher risk for exhibiting violence, sexual offenses, and criminal behaviors in adolescence or adulthood. Despite the increased risk of poor social adjustment associated with living in poverty, some children exposed to poverty-related adversity have positive social adjustment. One finding that has consistently been linked to their resiliency is the presence of supportive adult-child relationships. The proposed studies will assess if quality peer relationships provide the same benefits that quality adult-child relationships provide in impoverished populations, by improving social development and biological regulation (i.e. stress physiology) despite exposure to poverty-related adversity. The studies are driven by the critical need to create readily accessible and scalable interventions to promote optimal social development for at-risk impoverished children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research utilizes an innovative cross-species human/rodent approach to explore peer relationship quality as a potential target for interventions aimed at promoting social skill and stress physiology resiliency in at-risk, impoverished children. To this end, the proposed studies will draw on existing data from the Family Life Project, a longitudinal sample of 1,292 human children recruited at birth (oversampled for poverty status), in order to complete longitudinal modeling related to the impact of poverty-related adversity on social skills and stress physiology, and the mediating role of peer relationships. The proposed research will also leverage a scarcity-adversity rodent model to study neurobiological mechanisms by which resource scarcity impacts the development of social behavior, and test interventions of neurobehavioral repair grounded in social learning theory. These interventions will aim to improve the quality of peer interactions via naturalistic and pharmacological manipulations.

This project, which trains an anthropology graduate student in methods of scientifically rigorous and empirical data collection and analysis, explores what impact the institutionalization of religion in government has on transforming the public sphere, urban space, and practices of piety. By examining the effects of governance on religious practices, urban planning, capitalism, tourism, and identity, the project advances our understanding of modernity and state-building in socio-religious contexts.

This project examines how institutionalization of religion has affected popular practices of religiosity, specifically a network of shrines in a range of urban and non-urban settings with varying levels of state political oversight. The research will be conducted at three sites (in major city, a secondary city that is known for its shrine, and a city that has been rebranded as a hub for religious tourism). Utilizing interviews, participant-observation, and archival, research will investigate how pilgrims, locals, urban planners, architects, and other stakeholders understand the transformation of these sites. This research will contribute to debates in political anthropology about governance, theories in the anthropology of religion about pilgrimage, mobility, and tourism, and analyses in urban anthropology about space and sectarian identity. Findings from this research will provide insight into how religious politics are lived on the ground and how the administrative and bureaucratic practices of governance in a modern state transform the role of religion in public life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores how to facilitate this interaction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ""neurobiology of language"" is the biological implementation for representations and processes involved in the  production and understanding of speech,  sign, and language in context. Previously, brain structures and functions for language could only be  inferred from studying humans with brain injury. By monitoring the anatomical encodings and physiological dynamics of language processing  in awake, behaving human beings, researchers can now study human language at a biological precision previously possible only in  animal models (of functions other than language). Concomitant with these new approaches has been a  dramatic increase in the number of investigators dedicating their effort to understanding the biological  basis of language. The growth in the number of investigators and the use of expanded techniques and theoretical perspectives have driven the need for enhanced transparency, integrity, and robust and rapid research dissemination.  The PIs will explore these topics while developing systems and operations for open science, facilitating reproducibility and replicability of research, and dissemination of new findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigators will consider how increasing population growth, extensive urban development, and related landscape changes have altered natural watershed ecosystems, stressing natural resources and processes, thereby contributing to water pollution.  This project will benefit society by investigating basic scientific processes that have contributed to the vulnerability of a flood-prone region, so that these can be mitigated.  The project will also develop research capacity at a historically Black university, and by providing rigorous education, training, and hands-on research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented minority groups, thereby building scientific human resource capacity.  The project promotes direct collaboration among the various disciplines and will have significant impact in analyzing long-term data and integrating it with geospatial data while monitoring natural resources.  The geospatial data and models that will be developed as part of this project will be useful resources for decision-makers within city and state governments, local communities, and non-profit organizations to better monitor and manage those resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the project are: (1) characterizing the landscape level spatiotemporal land use and land cover changes in the urban watersheds; (2) identifying and analyzing the environmental footprint of these urban watersheds on ecosystems by developing a comprehensive geospatial database; and (3) investigating the current and future environmental trends in urban watersheds using geospatial and system dynamic models.  The project will use an integration of various types of remotely sensed imagery to characterize land-use/land-cover change, and will use a GIS to integrate information at different scales.  It will also develop integrated hydro-landscape models that can be used to simulate anticipated scenarios.  A spatial interpolation analysis of nutrient and metal concentrations in the soil and water will be conducted to identify and map contamination in the urban watersheds. The project will generate new information on the extent of optimum watershed development that is necessary for minimal impact on natural resources and the tangible steps that might be taken to improve the quality of local watersheds. The research will reveal how landscape analysis using geospatial data can be used to develop remediation paths for the improved watershed management.  The project will focus on the greater Houston region, a region with a history of flooding and water pollution challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concomitant with the creation of these new roles, however, has been the rise of high-profile controversies around the potential abusive use of big data and of the algorithms whose creation they enable. This project thus focuses on 'data science ethics' and works to understand how to best cultivate a culture of ethics in data science. It will assess the state, structure, and substance of data ethics in both educational and industrial contexts. Within the academic sector, the project will conduct interviews with faculty and undergraduates and analyze relevant syllabi to develop an account of what constitutes data ethics in the academy. Comparing these data across faculty and disciplines will show major areas of agreement and disagreement over what data ethics education should entail. Within the industrial sector, the project will research how data ethics are beginning to figure into corporate practice and study how companies define data ethics and attempt to integrate ethical considerations into everyday work. Data will come from in-depth interviews with those in industry and analyses of corporate documents from companies that have made public commitments to addressing data ethics. The PIs would then compare data and findings from across these two contexts to identify commonalities, differences, and useful strategies for advancing data ethics across social contexts and professional sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will draw together a diverse group of researchers who in collaboration with educators and data science practitioners will: (1) document and assess barriers and opportunities for integrating ethics into data science practice; (2) assess the continuities and discontinuities emerging between industrial and academic contexts; and (3) develop a foundation for cohesive, comprehensive, integrative data ethics education. The investigators will use a range of complementary methods to do so, including qualitative interviews, expert judgement, and quantitative computational analyses of the latent thematic and topical structure of documents from academia and industry. Project outcomes and findings will be disseminated through conferences, journals, and through holding a synthetic workshop after the completion of data collection and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Who people love often affects where they live and work, with whom they have and raise children, who they call friends and family, how they spend their time and money, who celebrates their successes, and who supports them in times of need. As a result, the quality of romantic relationships broadly affects physical health, mental health, and financial success. Understanding how people form and maintain these important relationships is central to understanding human social behavior. It is also a clear means of improving human health, happiness, and well being. Yet gaining a deeper understanding of the romantic partner choice process, and the role it plays in human welfare, is one of the great challenges of social and behavioral science. Romantic relationships develop within complex social environments. They are influenced by interactions between individual preferences, competition between romantic rivals, and mutual attractions that change over time. Accounting for such complex and intricate social systems requires assessing multiple, intertwined processes that are difficult to measure and observe. This project approaches the problem by developing a new computer simulation technique. The aim is to apply this technique to accelerate progress in basic understanding of romantic partner choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new technique (""couple simulation"") compares theories of mate selection on their ability to reconstruct actual romantic relationships within computer simulations. Couple simulation will advance progress in mate choice research by providing the first empirical metrics for comparing different models of human mate selection. The method will help address questions such as: (1) what precisely are the decision processes that connect abstract, ideal preferences to real mate choices? (2) how do these early mate choice decisions relate to longer-term relationship quality and dissolution? (3) is it possible to identify those who are likely to have a fulfilling and supportive relationship? In preliminary studies, this technique identifies accurate models of romantic partner choice and predicts romantic relationship quality. This project will further develop couple simulation by combining agent-based modeling with studies of committed romantic couples, of change and stability in romantic relationships over time, and of the dynamics of initial relationship formation. The scientific aim is to produce computational models that more accurately describe romantic partner choice and that can more effectively aid people in forming fulfilling relationships. The project will also provide training in computational methods for a diverse group of early-career researchers, and it will contribute a novel, validated tool for relationship science to continue building on these successes into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is coordinated with a larger effort to publish comprehensive dictionaries of the languages of ""Beringia"" (the Bering Sea region), and comes at a key juncture in the language's history. Itelmen is critically endangered: at this time, the number of native speakers has dwindled to fewer than 10.

Archaeologists at the University of Florida are investigating the foods and beverages consumed by the ancient Maya, by analyzing organic chemical residues and starch grains in pottery vessels and on stone grinding tools. These analyses are innovative in that they help identify ancient Maya ""recipes"" rather than single ingredients. They provide insights into the individual's choices of ingredients and methods of combining, processing, and serving foods and drinks, using different tools and vessels. This study is focused on periods of cultural transition, to better understand the relationship between people and food during times of social and environmental change. Differences in Maya recipes through time, across space, and among community members enable understanding of the relationships among people, their foods, and their environmental and social circumstances. The role of food in culture is vital to understanding expressions of personal identity and responses to changing social and environmental circumstances. Thus, this study is relevant to understanding of human cultures in all places and at all times, including today. This study incorporates several methodological advancements by: 1) conducting residue analysis on museum-curated and recently recovered archaeological artifacts to assess preservation and recovery techniques, 2) adding new chemical and micro-botanical signatures to the array of expected ancient Maya ingredients, and 3) using methods to elucidate food combinations and processing steps rather than just ingredients. These approaches are influencing many scientific disciplines, and fostering collaboration among archaeologists, geochemists, and analytical chemists. This research has an important educational component, because multiple graduate students are learning how to collect, extract and prepare organic chemical residues and starch grains from archaeological contexts for analysis.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This study will use recovered food residues to identify combinations of ingredients found on food-related artifacts from several pre-contact Maya sites in Belize and Guatemala. The focus is on times of Maya cultural transition, both early (300 BC-250 AD) and late (800-1100 AD), and on places in different ecological zones (coastal, inland, and riverine). Techniques used include liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and starch grain analysis by microscopy. This is the first research project in the Maya region to identify the chaine operatoire (operational sequence) of Maya ""recipes"" using residue analysis and to explore correlations between food ingredients and food-related artifacts and activities at different stages of food production and consumption. Residues will be correlated to style and inferred function of the artifacts (determined by analysts working on multiple archaeological projects), and the context in which they were found (site location, age, function, and social status), to provide insights into the relations among foods, food-related tools and vessels, and the people who used them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Andrew N. Meltzoff at the University of Washington's Institute for Learning &amp; Brain Sciences, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of social interaction and reciprocal play in fostering early altruism. Reciprocal play is a specific form of social play involving turn-taking. The Fellow's prior work showed that reciprocal play can trigger young children's altruism in the immediate context. This project will examine how reciprocal play may foster altruism across contexts and time. Promoting altruism in children is a desirable societal goal, and thus the research has potential to have a broad impact. This results can be disseminated to help early educators and children at risk. Such information would be especially useful for parents, teachers and other practitioners working with children who commonly seek to promote positive social development in children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves four interlocking studies that will: (a) examine how reciprocal play can encourage the spread of altruism across contexts, (b) examine how reciprocal play may maintain altruism over time, (c) assess whether other types of play show similar effects, and (d) examine how merely observing reciprocal play among others might potentially encourage altruism. Although developmental psychology has long held that positive interactions in early childhood are important in promoting a general prosocial interaction, this research will examine how specific everyday aspects of childrens' social experience that can shape altruism. The findings promise to have impact on developmental theory as well educational practice. The proposed work also sets the stage for the future design of intervention studies, which could provide information to educators and scientists on how to engender and promote social skills, including altruistic behavior, in young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scholars of non-food producing societies have noted close ties between resource availability and the organization of forager societies. In temperate regions, change among hunter-gatherers is often related to shifts in the amount of wild foods available during the year. In areas like the African tropics where resources do not vary significantly from season to season, climatic oscillations over hundreds or thousands of years are more important drivers of social and economic change in small scale human societies. The ways that broad shifts in climate patterns affect social strategies employed by people relying on wild resources in the tropics, however, are not well understood. The deep time perspective of archaeology provides a useful lens for investigating such shifts over long periods of time. This study will use archaeological data to examine the ways small-scale, non-food producing societies adapted to well-known climatic fluctuations over the last 20,000 years in eastern Africa. Findings will provide new information on the role that hunter-gatherer social flexibility had in shaping the social diversity of prehistoric eastern Africa.

Using zooarchaeological and isotopic analyses, this study will examine changing hunting and site-use strategies as well as local rainfall patterns to track correlations in forager lifeways and environmental changes.

Traditional urban planning and management approaches (land reclamation, sea walls, etc.), and even newer initiatives (restoration science and other initiatives oriented toward making cities resilient) have tended to rely on models that assume adequate provisioning of public financial and infrastructural investment necessary to return coastal cities to a durable and dry equilibrium state. This project explores the diverse approaches urban administrators use to stabilize urban environments, where models forecast persistent uncertainties in public infrastructural planning and increased reliance on stakeholder inputs. The data will be important for American municipalities searching for alternatives in urban infrastructural planning around uncertain futures. Findings will be disseminated to various governmental, non-governmental, and other organizations concerned with evaluating the limits and opportunities associated with water and sewage infrastructure, and coastline management. The project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, and broadens participation through the inclusion of underrepresented students and scholars in scientific research.

Darwin's own theory of evolution by natural selection was a non-mathematical, non-statistical theory of the unfolding history of life on earth. The research supported by this project will eventually be published as a scholarly book that captures these developments in a clear and rigorous manner.

Yet, an integrative theory, allowing for different sociocultural and individual factors that might prioritize one kind of motive over another, is still missing.  This project aims to develop a theoretical model of the sociocultural determinants of human motives.  To develop a powerful testbed, with strong broader impacts, the research examines why and how individual actions are motivated in response to environmental challenges. Environmental crises such as pollution or the depletion of natural resources pose some of the greatest collective challenges faced by society today. Responses of individuals to these challenges have critical consequences. By understanding what drives people's actions in this context, progress will be made in addressing a fundamental question about human behavior. The research is expected to have wide impact across a number of scholarly disciplines, with important implications for public policy, education and philanthropy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory proposes that different sociocultural and individual factors orient people towards more internal and personal reasons or toward more external and social reasons for their actions.  The factors that orient people toward more internal and personal reasons for their actions include individualistic values, high socioeconomic status, and social belonging.  The factors that orient people toward more external and social reasons for their actions include collectivistic values, low socioeconomic status, and social isolation.  The research examines the extent to which environmental beliefs versus perceived environmental norms drive pro-environmental behaviors, and how this differs for people from a wide range of personal experiences and backgrounds. The explanatory role of sense of control and attention allocation is also investigated. The studies use diverse methodologies including a nationally representative study of Americans, a laboratory behavioral study, a longitudinal study of daily environmental behaviors, and a community field experiment at local grocery stores assessing shopping behavior.

They are less likely to mind wander; and they are more likely to seek answers, to be attentive and ready to learn, and they actually learn better as evidenced through both brain and behavioral outcomes.  However, little is known about either the neural basis of curiosity, or ways to induce it.  This project proposes that curiosity is a metacognitive state consisting of feelings that people almost know the answer to the object of curiosity.  This project proposes a series of experiments that investigate both cognitive/behavioral and brain responses. It tests the novel hypothesis that curiosity can be induced by manipulations that alter metacognitive processes, with favorable consequences for learning. Understanding the scientific basis of curiosity will have broad practical and educational implications for increasing students' learning and their desire to learn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past work on curiosity is largely correlational, and often confounds a priori knowledge with feelings of curiosity. In contrast, the experiments in this project induce curiosity via manipulations that alter metacognitive states. Behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, will investigate the impact of curiosity on attention and learning. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to computer-controlled learning scenarios where curiosity is manipulated via priming, fluency, multitasking, divided attention or inhibitory retrieval cuing. Dependent variables include reaction and study times, recall scores, and event-related potentials, as well as ratings of curiosity, confidence, and mind wandering. Curiosity will be manipulated using methods known to influence metacognitive processes. The electrophysiological studies investigating neural processes will allow use of mediational models to evaluate the role of distinct behavioral and brain components related to curiosity. These experiments will disentangle learning attributable to a priori knowledge versus those attributable to curiosity states. This project will help us to understand foundational neural and behavioral processes underlying curiosity-related learning and reward in learning, and the role of metacognition.  There is potential to develop practical methods for systematically inducing curiosity which can be applied to classroom and other settings to enhance learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What happens when these migrants return to their native countries? Many criminal deportees, having been raised in the U.S., are unfamiliar with their homeland's language, history, and social customs. Furthermore, criminal deportees can face the prejudices of fellow citizens who suspect them of bringing crime and delinquent behavior into the country. These factors can present challenges as deportees attempt to resettle after deportation. Yet at the same time, deportees have often learned English, attended school, and learned marketable skills during their time in the U.S., which can lead to employment and status in their countries of origin. With a pending rise in criminal deportations, it is essential to identify the opportunities and obstacles encountered by deportees, and the services and resources that would assist their resettlement. Dr. Kivland of Dartmouth College and her team will conduct a longitudinal ethnography of deportation, following the a cohort of deportees over the first three years of the resettlement process. Findings will be disseminated to organizations and individuals that influence policy debates related to migration. The project also broadens participation of underrepresented groups in science, and provides opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields. The project builds capacity and infrastructure through the broadening of international scientific cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in Haiti, where Dr. Kivland has conducted research since 2006 and has extensive knowledge of political and social conditions. Haiti is a is an ideal research site because it has recently witnessed a dramatic rise in its deportee population. In 2016, it received 310 deportees; in 2017, this number rose to 5,578 deportees. Haiti is also an important research setting because it provides an opportunity to study a racial subgroup rarely analyzed in deportation studies. Whereas several studies have analyzed the criminalization and stigmatization that Latino deportees face in Latin American countries, there has been less research on the experiences of Afro-descendant deportees in the Caribbean. This study hypothesizes that Haitian deportees' experiences are particularly shaped by their Black racial identity. Preliminary research suggests that Haitian deportees may confront the prejudices of fellow Haitians who suspect them of violence, crime, and what it perceived as a disreputable African American culture. But they may also capitalize on their racial identity and American cultural capital to find employment, status, and community in Haiti. Working with a team of Haiti-based graduate students and U.S.-based undergraduate students, Dr. Kivland will chronicle the everyday successes and challenges that deportees face in their attempts to rebuild lives in Haiti. Using the ethnographic methods of observation, participant observation, and interviews, the team will analyze how deportees' racial identity, deportee status, migration history, and other emergent factors shape their resettlement trajectories in positive and negative ways. Findings from this research will lead to a fuller understanding of the societal factors and personal circumstances that lead to deportation, the difficulties and prospects people face once deported, and the resources that would assist deportees in the resettlement process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will examine the effect of these rule changes on negative messages through sentiment analyses of online messages sent before and after any policy shifts. By identifying sources of individual and geographic variation in the effects of the rule changes, it will shed light on the social and cultural factors that shape responses to corporate rules and that contribute to patterns of cyber aggression. The research also will identify organizational practices that aid, or fail to aid, in limiting the negativity of everyday online interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use a convergence of expertise in different disciplines to accomplish its goals.  Data will come from three sources: 1) online messages that target individuals on the basis of their demographic characteristics, 2) messages that contain common slurs, and 3) messages that include the location from which they were posted (geo-tagged).  These will be captured and processed by extending geographic visualization and analysis techniques and information retrieval methods, and by using computational methods to compute sentiment and to assess the positivity and negativity of social media messages.  Statistical analyses will show if new corporate rules result in significant decreases or possibly increases in level of sentiment negativity.  They also will show whether abusive communications become more evasive and less identifiable following corporate rule changes."

Rapid advances in AI methods, the proliferation of spatial big data, and immense computing power are transforming the way research is conducted and prompts new discoveries. This project develops a new Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) solution to enable large-scale, automated, intelligent, and highly accurate landform feature detection and terrain analysis. Conventional approaches to terrain analysis have been limited to the use of pixel/object-based image analysis and shallow machine learning, which suffer from significant performance challenges when dealing with big data in complex classification tasks. This research, which spatializes deep (machine) learning by incorporating spatial principles and spatial relational data, represents a methodological breakthrough in GeoAI and spatial data science more broadly. Leveraging GeoAI for landform feature recognition enriches spatial knowledge and enhances the understanding of land-surface processes on Earth and other planets. It also benefits geospatial applications that have societal benefit, including anomaly detection that can be used in search and rescue operations and by recognizing landform features indicative of environmental change. The investigators intend on developing the GeoAI community using the model used to establish the Geographic Information Science (GISci) community in the past. GeoAI-related symposia will be organized to serve as an important venue for researchers from diverse disciplines and organizations to discuss new advances and open challenges in GeoAI. The project includes a postdoctoral scholar and trains undergraduate students as interdisciplinary scientists. Both investigators are female scientists and they actively mentor scientists from underrepresented groups. All data and code developed during this project will be open-sourced to benefit the broader geospatial community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant challenges exist in successfully applying GeoAI to terrain analysis, including the complexity and diversity in landform features, the dearth of training data, the lack of spatial knowledge in model design, and the limited understanding of machine inferential processes. This research will tackle such challenges by developing (1) a comprehensive terrain dataset GeoNat to support terrain analysis and various machine learning tasks; (2) a machine learning model TerrainAI that injects key spatial principles (spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity) to enable cross-scale deep learning from multi-source, georeferenced data; and (3) an interactive visualization tool that opens up the ""black box"" of the machine's learning and decision process. Relying on these tools, three research questions will be answered: (I) What are the unique spatial structures, patterns, and spatial scale that a machine learns to differentiate landform features? (II) How do human and machine recognition processes compare? And (III) How can the underlying geomorphological processes that yield certain forms of a feature in different landscapes be predicted? The identification of process-form relationships significantly impacts the agenda of geographical, spatial scientific and related sciences such as geomorphology in fostering the creation of a community-consensus landform classification system. The TerrainAI model is not limited to the study of landforms but is generalizable and applicable to detect any geographical objects, both natural and human-made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Music forms an important part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and it is one of the few universals shared by all known human cultures. Yet its utility and potential evolutionary advantages remain a mystery. This project will test the hypothesis that early musical exposure has benefits that extend beyond music to critical aspects of human communication, such as speech perception in noise. In addition, the investigators will test whether early musical training is associated with less severe effects of aging on the ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. Degraded ability to understand speech in noise is a common complaint among older listeners and hearing loss has been shown to be associated with social isolation and more rapid cognitive and health declines. If formal musical training is shown to affect improved perception and speech communication in later life, the outcomes could have a potentially major impact on quality of life,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier studies have suggested relationships between early musical training and improved auditory neural processing and perception, but the studies' impact has been limited by small sample numbers and inconsistent methods between different studies. This project will test a large number of participants (N=360) with uniform recruitment criteria and testing protocols across six different sites. Measures will include the neural frequency following response (FFR) to speech sounds, behavioral frequency selectivity, speech perception in noise, speech perception against a background of competing talkers, pitch discrimination, and auditory masking. The participants will also complete other assessments, including a personality inventory questionnaire, a profile of musical perception skills, a spatial reasoning test to assess general cognitive ability, as well as a background questionnaire to determine socio-economic status, education, and musical background. Participants will be selected to span a wide range of ages and musical experience. The neural data and the speech perception measures will be related to factors of musical training, such as the number of years of musical training and the age at which musical training began.

Strategic thinking is critical to make everyday decisions and such decisions often involve other players who have different motivations and perspectives. These differences must be understood at the time of decision to make logical and informed decisions. Research has shown that adults have innate abilities to coordinate on efficient market outcomes even with very limited knowledge. At the same time, they have limited abilities to anticipate what others may do and to strategize in a large variety of multi-person situations, such as bargaining. This suggests that some abilities develop while others do not. An important objective of the project is to study how children develop (or do not develop) these abilities and to better understand the reasons for irrational choices in adults. Also, the project will allow to better assess the limitations in the acquisition and transfer of cognitive skills to decision-making. This will help determine whether cognitive skills and rational behavior can be enhanced. Last, the study may help explore new curriculum development strategies and inform interventions around children and teenagers. Indeed, one essential role of education is to promote critical thinking. Education is thus expected to impact positively the way we make decisions. Our study will contribute to the design of an educational environment capable of promoting success beyond school-related attainment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will feature four sets of lab-in-the field experiments. School-age students from Pre-K to 12th grade will be recruited from public and private schools in the Los Angeles area. For comparison, adult controls will also be recruited. Each experiment will evaluate the performance of each participant on tasks designed to assess cognitive traits and on game theoretic paradigms that require those underlying cognitive traits. Four game theoretic paradigms in which adults comply differentially with equilibrium predictions will be studied. The first experiment will investigate how humans develop their innate ability to coordinate on efficient solutions in repeated relationships. The second experiment will explore strategic situations in which adults are largely heterogeneous in their ability to anticipate what others will do and to formulate a best response. The third experiment will explore the underlying causes that make mixed strategy behavior non-intuitive and difficult to implement. The last experiment will investigate the reasons why the ability to strategize does not develop naturally in the presence of informational asymmetries. The study will allow to identify behavioral biases that develop gradually. Tracking biases to their developmental causes is important to inform research in Economics and to develop theoretical models with better predictive power. At the same time, the study will offer clues that may be used to remedy such biases. The study will help assess whether limitations of strategic thinking abilities stem from an imperfect acquisition of cognitive skills, which may be remedied by exposing children to specific problems and teaching them how to think about them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Digital platforms provide the fundamental infrastructure for independent contractors working in the ""gig economy"" as well as for workers in the warehousing and shipping organizations that handle distribution for companies like Amazon. By generating findings about local mediation of platform capitalism, this study will produce recommendations for regional governments and firms looking to navigate these market shifts intelligently. The results of this project are to be disseminated via separate reports for regional governments, logistics and shipping organizations, independent contractors, and labor unions; accessible publications in popular outlets; an undergraduate course on platform economies; and the training and support of a doctoral student working in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze how local environments mediate platform capitalism through an empirical inquiry that focuses on the translation of digital platforms into urban regions in the US.

The platforms to be studied are those operated by Uber, Airbnb, and Amazon. Three primary research questions will guide this inquiry: (1) How are local organizational forms and functions altered in response to platform capitalism? (2) What resistances and affordances are presented by existing technological infrastructures? and (3) How does local cultural practice mediate the deployment and use of digital platforms? To address these questions, the researcher will use multiple qualitative methods including content analysis of industry, media, and government documents; 30 semi-structured interviews with key informants; and spatial mapping of platform densities and flows across selected urban regions.

In daily life, for example, a person easily picks up a red apple from a grocery display containing many kinds of fruit. Successful interactions with such complex environments require seamless coordination among multiple mechanisms. In particular, mechanisms of attentional selection that help us make sense of the world work in unity with those that underlie action selection, allowing us to generate adaptive movements. This attention-action synergy is at the root of all complex behavior.  However, researchers typically study these two mechanisms separately, without investigating interactions between them. This practice makes direct comparisons between the findings in attentional selection and action selection impossible. To overcome this gap, the goal of this proposal is to determine the interplay between mechanisms controlling attentional selection and action selection, particularly when recent selection history biases subsequent behavior. It will provide a basis for unifying theories of behavioral mechanisms involved in the selection of attention and action in a global frame. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed project will focus on three understudied aspects of action selection: variation in action execution, effectors, and biomechanical costs, to determine their novel relations with the wealth of research on selection history of perceptual features. To ensure successful outcomes, an international collaboration between the two research teams, who will play complementary and synergistic roles, will be formed between experts in attention and motor control  and computational modeling. This joint endeavor will advance our understanding of the interdependence between attention and action-driven mechanisms to eventually explain adaptive, real-world selection behavior. By including talented undergraduates including nationally selected underrepresented minorities, this proposal also intends to foster the integration of research, STEM and a broad education. Furthermore, outcomes can also contribute to significant technological innovations, including foundation for novel control architecture for robot arms and teleoperators, improving human-computer-interface such as cognitive neural prosthetics and the widely used touch-user-interfaces (e.g. smart phones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded with the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the SBE-UKRI Lead Agency collaborative research opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes to advance electrode technology and signal processing of EEG to enable measurement of brain electrical activity outside the laboratory in the real world, including playing tennis, a complex, active, goal-directed motor task. The project will use novel methods to measure brain electrical activity as people walk on a university campus. Some subjects will be physically intact; some will have lower limb amputations.

To examine this issue, we will directly record brain activity from subjects performing spatial navigation and memory tasks.  We will measure how the brain supports different aspects of spatial memory by having people perform several different types of navigation paradigms using virtual reality on a laptop computer. Our participants are neurosurgical patients who have electrodes surgically implanted as part of treatment for their epilepsy. These patients volunteer to participate in our experiments, thus providing rare direct human brain data on the neural basis of behavior.  We will analyze the patterns of brain activity to understand how spatial and memory information is represented across the brain, including both local neural signals in individual regions as well as interactions between brain structures. Further, in addition to recording brain activity, we will also apply targeted (and safe) patterns of electrical stimulation to brains during certain parts of these tasks, allowing us to test how behavior varies when selected brain regions are stimulated. The findings from our research will help us to understand fundamental types of brain signals that support spatial navigation and to compare how these signals differ across brain structures.  This project also has a substantial educational component with the development of educational and outreach programs to advance neuroscience education and research at both the K-12 and University levels. We will deploy new curricula on the neuroscience of navigation and memory at New York City schools. To support this outreach, we will develop novel and engaging augmented reality spatial navigation protocols, enabling the students to study spatial memory in their everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to characterize the distinct neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and memory in the human brain, with emphasis on the medial temporal lobe (MTL).  We approach this goal with four key elements: direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients, custom-designed spatial memory tasks using virtual reality, novel computational methods for analyzing local and distributed neural signals related to spatial behavior, and direct brain stimulation for testing the causality of these signals.  The subjects in our study are neurosurgical patients who will perform customized spatial memory tasks that are designed to distinguish neural signals corresponding to spatial and non-spatial memory at different scales.  Our data analyses will identify patterns of brain activity underlying specific memory processes in the MTL as well as various brain regions using both single-neuron spiking and network oscillations. All experimental designs are grounded in our preliminary data, in which we show that the nature of neural responses to spatial vs. non-spatial memory tasks varies fundamentally across hemisphere, with the right MTL supporting navigation and left MTL supporting memory. Furthermore, to identify how information propagates across this network, we will characterize the functional role of a new phenomenon we recently identified, cortical traveling waves, in which oscillations propagate across the brain to coordinate inter-region communication. Finally, we will use electrical stimulation to causally validate our findings. By combining data across these methods, we will obtain a comprehensive view of how spatial memories are represented in various brain areas and distinguish the large-scale brain networks where information propagates to support spatial memory and navigation. The results of these experiments have the potential for evaluating the key theoretical question of whether a single electrophysiological process in the medial temporal lobe supports both spatial and episodic memory or, alternatively, whether separate neural processes and sub-regions in the MTL support distinct aspects of multi-scale navigation and memory behaviors. THis approach involving direct human brain recordings and stimulation is qualified to address this question because the data we will acquire overcomes limitations of both animal electrophysiology and noninvasive neuroimaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Then, REU students learn via hands-on experience the value of statistical analysis, use of statistical software to draw inferences about the data, and presentation skills to disseminate the findings gained in their research. Alongside with the conduct of their research projects, REU students complete a series of structured activities aimed at preparing them to apply to graduate school. These activities, such as attending professional development seminars and workshops, participating at colloquium in the field of psychology, listening to invited guest speakers from graduate program admission offices, are coordinated by the Baruch College REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes have led to a new and more complex social landscape. It has increased encounters with people who have multiple social identities, including different combinations of racial, ethnic, or national identities.  Although people are often threatened by difference, this project considers how such differences may help to create positive social change and greater harmony among members of various social groups. The research focuses on the unique role of people who are recognized as having multiple identities that represent groups traditionally regarded as fundamentally different. Examples include American biracial individuals who share their identity with both Blacks and Whites in the U.S., or Arab citizens of Israel who share their identity with both Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. This unique form of social identity places members of these groups in-between social categories that are typically seen in oppositional ways, allowing these individuals to potentially act as a social gateway to promote positive exchanges between the groups.  These kinds of groups are therefore termed ""Gateway Groups"".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad objective of this project is to investigate the potential role that such Gateway Groups might play in positively transforming intergroup relations. It provides a novel framework that captures the modern complexity of social boundaries and social identity. Several studies explore the mechanisms and boundary conditions necessary to realize the potential of Gateway Groups in a wide range of social contexts including groups in long-term conflict. The research specifically applies psychological interventions developed in laboratory-based research to reduce intergroup tension and conflict and to promote reconciliation in contexts of immediate social relevance. Five experiments focus on identifying the processes underlying the influence of Gateway Groups and the conditions under which they are more or less effective. The insights from those experiments are then tested in three other studies to assess the potential of Gateway Groups to improve intergroup relations in naturalistic settings. Theoretically, this approach moves beyond the common binary view of ""us"" versus ""them"" to offer a broader and more accurate model of intergroup dynamics. Practically, the research aims to develop interventions that can be applied generally to reduce intergroup conflict and promote more harmonious and productive relations between groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, processes of conducting volunteer flood rescues, factors that affect immediate decision-making during rescues, decisions about volunteer group development, and use of social media for rescuing and group development will be researched through intense interviewing and participation with rescuers. Disasters are unique opportunities to study social processes, and they are also becoming more frequent social problems.  Disasters of recent years have introduced volunteer organizations supported by social media and new technologies. Limited scholarly research has studied this volunteer rescue movement, these volunteers, or these rescue operations. Findings will contribute to scholarly understanding of group formation and development and how this may be affected by new technologies.  They also will contribute to public welfare by being integrated in courses such as on emergency management and hazard mitigation and recovery, and by being directly shared with organizations that do rescues as well as the broader emergency management and public communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the research goal, ethnographic research will be conducted that includes participation with volunteer organizations that conduct rescues, 20-40 interviews with emergency management officials, 30-60 interviews with volunteer rescuers, and 20-30 interviews with persons rescued by civilian volunteers. Over the life of the project, this will involve training and traveling with volunteer organizations as they respond to disasters, such as the three to which these organizations responded in 2018, Hurricanes Florence and Michael and floods in Southeast Texas.  Participation will be in three different roles: boat rescuer, dispatcher, and leadership coordination. In addition, available social media data and media articles will be collected and analyzed inductively.  GIS technology will be used to analyze available geospatial data on rescue locations, which will be related to hazard data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference provides an annual scientific meeting for neuroscientists whose goal is to develop computationally defined models of brain information processing that explain rich measurements of brain activity and behavior. Historically, different disciplines have met subsets of these goals: Cognitive science has developed computational models at the cognitive level; computational neuroscience has developed neurobiologically plausible computational models at lower levels; cognitive neuroscience has mapped processes onto brain regions; and artificial intelligence has developed synthetic systems.  CCN is unique in its focus on the intersection between these fields.  In addition to advancing research, CCN seeks to contribute to the growing commercial use of biologically inspired hardware and software in Artificial Intelligence as well as being a vehicle for broadly impacting education and society.  One particular focus of CCN is increasing the visibility of women and scientists from underrepresented populations via speaking opportunities. This award will partially support travel grants for this purpose.  The conference will also include hands-on tutorials, and materials from these will propagate to various university curricula.  The award will support video recordings of the tutorials and talks.  These recordings will be made publicly available on the website to increase the broader impact of the conference to the wider community and those unable to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how vast populations of neurons give rise to complex behavior. Today, advances in various domains offer tangible possibilities to make fundamental conceptual breakthroughs. Modern neural recording technologies now provide opportunities to observe neural activity at unprecedented resolution and scale. At the same time, research in cognitive science has become increasingly sophisticated in identifying computational principles that may serve as the basis for human cognition, and machine learning and artificial intelligence have made great strides in building models to autonomously solve complex cognitive tasks. However, interactions among these distinct disciplines remain rare. This new conference may stimulate unifying frameworks that fully realize the cross-disciplinary potential of these individual advances. Concretely, the goal of CCN is to create and foster a community that will develop models of brain information processing with several key features. These models should (1) be fully computationally defined and implemented in computer simulations; (2) be neurobiologically plausible; (3) explain measurements of brain activity (and continue to do so as spatiotemporal resolution and scale improve); (4) explain behavior in the context of naturalistic stimuli and tasks; and (5) perform feats of intelligence such as recognition, internal modelling and representation of the environment, decision-making, planning, action, and motor control. Such models currently do not exist and are unlikely to emerge without greatly improved cross-disciplinary engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing research shows that factors such as the amount of available housing, energy markets, and government policies all contribute to energy vulnerability, and that energy vulnerability disproportionally affects the elderly, the disabled, renters, and low-income families. The investigator on this project will use a combination of ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and focus group research to understand the extent of energy vulnerability in three US counties, how energy providers work to address it, and how energy vulnerability relates to energy performance mechanisms. This research will provide important information for developing new policies and insights that could help to reduce energy vulnerability in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a multi-site ethnographic approach incorporating participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups to explore: (1) energy vulnerability across three different US counties; (2) the sociotechnical strategies used by energy services organizations to address energy vulnerability; and (3) how energy performance mechanisms shape energy efficiency at different spatial and temporal scales. Research will be conducted through the Energy Coordinating Agency (ECA), a multi-state nonprofit organization that works with state and federal programs to address energy vulnerability, and at four ECA energy centers. Qualitative analyses of media reports and internal reports and documents from the Energy Coordinating Agency will be used to supplement other forms of data gathering. The main goals are to advance understanding of the dynamics of energy vulnerability in the US, to share these insights to find ways to help reduce energy vulnerability, and to show how energy performance can be used as an analytic framework for theorizing how humans interact with technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the project explores urban democracy for which a study of transporters provides a unique and valuable vantage point. This proposed project will be the first to follow the narrative of legal and political claims-making of these transport operators, as they interact with governmental institutions in India. Translating 'paper laws' into actionable regulation is critical for all legal systems. This research queries how these paper laws, rules and regulations are framed, contested and finally implemented in actual practice. The project accomplishes this by mapping the every-day co-operation and contestation in framing regulations between the communities of operator unions, transport bureaucrats, courts, lawyers, and civic associations to sustain the city-level operation of the law, within the broader narrative of city politics and constitutional rights language. Significant contributions to sociolegal research and anthropology flow from this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks: How does the political action of small-scale transport operators--the auto-rickshaw drivers, cycle-rickshaw pullers, and erstwhile horse carriage drivers all belonging to the urban working poor, affect democratic processes in the postcolonial megacity? This study undertakes a historically informed, ethnographic investigation on the legal and political processes by which these transport operators become political agents . The research explores how the working poor participate in and negotiate urban governance, not always through extra-legal mobilizations and demands, but also by working within the framework of democratic policymaking, formal politics, and rights language. The study materials date to 1911, when Delhi became the capital. In its study of democracy, the project brings center stage the collective and individual claims for inclusion that the urban working poor make through their political action. This research, employing both ethnographic and archival methods, will be conducted in courts and archives in India, colonial archives in the UK, government offices, and the street in Delhi. This study examines the entanglement of two fundamental queries in contemporary times: a) how does a democracy actually function? and b) the nature of urbanization processes in our cities in times of great economic, social, and environmental precarity. More specifically, the study investigates how democratic functioning intersects with the lives of the urban working poor whose work straddles the organized and unorganized sectors of the economy in a non-western context. The project has implications for remedial measures to aid underserved, poor workers in urban environments in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is based on a consideration of the fundamental human motivation to avoid harm. Not only do people avoid harm to themselves, people also think it reasonable for others to avoid harm. It is therefore expected that people will be more tolerant of opposing viewpoints when those viewpoints are seen as being motivated by the avoidance of harm.  Framing social viewpoints in terms of harm avoidance may make those with opposing views seem more rational.  Six studies explore how to increase tolerance using the idea of rationality of harm avoidance.  The long-term goal of the research is to provide a strong foundation to inform efforts aimed at reducing intolerance, and enhancing positive interactions with those with opposing viewpoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests whether the fundamental human motivation to avoid harm can be leveraged to increase tolerance. Six studies examine people's willingness to interact with those with different views and their willingness to allow the expression of opposing views. The approach is to harness multiple methods, including laboratory experiments, archival studies, and nationally representative surveys. The experiments will be pre-registered and adhere to best practices of open science. Mediational analyses will test for the predicted pathway from harm avoidance to tolerance via perceived vulnerability and rationality.  The survey and behavioral studies will test other effects of the tolerance produced by the rationality of harm avoidance intervention. By emphasizing the universal human motivation to avoid harm, this project will transform scientific understanding of tolerance, and extend the research literatures on mind perception and intergroup empathy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second language learning requires significant time to learn material that has not occurred in the individual's prior experience. While this is obvious for foreign language learning, it is less obvious but also true for learning to read. Written and spoken language differ greatly in both their vocabulary and sentence structure, so becoming a fluent reader requires significant reading experience to learn how written language differs from speech. Because poor readers do not engage in this extensive practice, they fall further behind peers who have higher skill. Current instruction methods in both reading and second language learning are inadequate and intervention in both of these areas is in the national interest. Poor literacy is widespread in the US population and is associated with low employment, poor health outcomes, limited participation in society, and higher rates of incarceration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines memory and learning research to investigate how and why speaking during language learning yields not just better speaking skills but also better written and spoken language comprehension than more traditional reading- and listening-focused curricula. The studies rigorously compare second language learning via speaking vs. listening practice, including whether the learning method influences students' motivation to pay attention, practice, and learn. The studies also examine the link between speaking and short-term or working memory, which is the ability to hold information in mind for short durations. Working memory abilities are thought to be an important component of longer-term learning, including vocabulary learning in a native or foreign language. The same methods will be applied to interventions aimed at improving reading comprehension for poor readers with dyslexia or other sources of low literacy, including inadequate instruction, practice, or barriers from low English skills. The interventions will use spoken language exercises that provide practice with the vocabulary and sentence structure patterns of written language, which are essentially ""foreign"" to a reluctant reader. The aim is to provide key learning opportunities that are crucial to developing reading fluency without always requiring reading practice in which poor readers are reluctant to engage. Both the second language and the reading interventions also investigate students' response to various educational interventions, where students who begin with more knowledge generally get greater benefit from additional instruction, leaving behind those who most need the help. If the speaking interventions provide essential background skills, they could help people with dyslexia and other struggling learners learn from the novel interventions tested in this project and position struggling learners to take advantage of existing instruction in current school curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program, the Science of Learning Program, and the EHR Core Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research looks at the efficiency of transportation sector and how social welfare can be improved through appropriate policies. The research also considers the impact of a centralizing platform, like Uber.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project develops a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs. This setup is then used to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) implies that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to misallocation of productive activities across countries; (ii) creates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade. Next, the research explores both theoretically and empirically the efficiency properties of equilibria in decentralized transportation markets and suggest appropriate policies for the improvement of world welfare.

Decision-making is shaped by issues still faced today, such as intra- and inter-group conflict or environmental conditions. Prehistoric archaeological deposits are particularly well suited to examining the incipient colonization of island landmasses, as well as the nature of early habitation, because they typically offer the first and only physical records of past human activity. Within a broader context of island settlement and use, Ryan Harke will study native fisher-gatherer populations who inhabited the only subtropical small-island ecosystems in North America. This research project will also have specific outcomes relating to public interest, including pre-modern seawater temperature data and new interpretive signage to educate visitors on the cultural and environmental history of the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific evidence demonstrates that tropical archipelagoes are the sum of interconnected terrestrial, nearshore, and pelagic habitats, many of which provided suitable marine subsistence resources, shelters, and trading grounds throughout human history. Thus, the archaeology of ""marginal"" small-island ecosystems offers the foundation to model human lifeways at and journeys to such places across the globe, and compare culturally and/or biologically distinct populations. This research will focus on the historical, ethnohistorical, and zooarchaeological datasets of the island of Key West, to determine when prehistoric Native Americans reached the island, and whether they constructed year-round villages there. These questions will be addressed using a method similar to dendrochronology (the study of tree rings) called sclerochronology. Using this technique on modern clam shells and those discarded by ancient peoples will reveal annual cycles of seawater temperature and salinity contained in their isotopic (geochemical) signatures, indicating season of habitation. By sampling a large collection of midden shells and evaluating the seasonality of other associated animal remains, this research will determine whether a fishing economy could be based on freshwater-deficient coral islands year-round. The Keys are a vital case study for worldwide colonization models in human island biogeography, as their indigenous peoples offer a rare circumstance of non-agricultural groups relocating to small islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience.

However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.

Studies have shown that whether and how children defend their victimized peers has a significant impact on the adjustment of victims. Although much research has focused on individual factors and on class-level dynamics of victimization, less is known about the role of teachers. This project will examine the complex ways in which teachers' characteristics, practices, and actions affect (1) students' beliefs and attitudes; (2) the classroom ecology; and (3) victimization and defending behaviors. Future researchers will be able to use these findings to develop teacher training programs. Findings may also facilitate the development of anti-bullying policies and classroom management strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will address the following research questions: What is the association between teaching practices and peer victimization? What is the association between teaching practices and students' desires to defend their victimized peers? How do teaching practices contribute to students' attitudes toward victimization, and are these associations a function of the quality of teacher-student relationships?  Social motivation theoretical models provide an important interpersonal context for socialization by teachers whereas social cognitive theory describes how socialization might contribute to student social cognition and the classroom climate. The researchers will examine reciprocal interactions between teachers and students in fourth and fifth grade classrooms. The project will use a short-term longitudinal design.  Multimethod (e.g., surveys, in-class observations) and multi-informant (teachers, students, trained observers) approaches will be used to gather unique data for multilevel analyses. The use of observational methodology will facilitate capturing teacher-classroom practices as well as teacher-student relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this, rigorous methods for analyzing network data are not widely available. Existing methods are either geared toward descriptive analysis or make restrictive assumptions and are difficult to implement. The proposed research will develop: (i) new methods for policy analysis with two-way interaction outcome data and (ii) models of network formation with many and different agents. Frequently analyzed two-way interaction include trade and migration flows across countries, the value of input flows across firms, and friendships. The proposed methods could lead to efficient analyses and inference about several policy questions such as whether preferential trade agreements increase trade or whether democracy reduces inter-state warfare. The research will therefore aid in formulating efficient policies to govern interactions among individuals, groups, and nations. This will increase trade and exchange and thus improve economic efficiency in the US and around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop: (i) nonparametric methods for policy analysis with dyadic outcome data and (ii) semiparametric models of network formation with heterogenous agents. The research will develop a uniform consistency results for a nonparametric dyadic regression estimator, formulate assumptions supporting causal inference using dyadic data (including estimation methods for proposed parameters of interest and their semiparametric efficiency bound analysis), and introduce methods of (efficient) semi- and non-parametric estimation. These methods are vast improvements over and generalizations of existing methods of network estimation. The research will also develop computation methods and provide ways to implement these new analytical methods. The PIs will make available software implementation of the proposed estimation and inference procedures in the form of a Python 3.6 package free of charge on PyPi and Github. In addition, all replication data, computer codes and supplemental research materials will also be made available online to support additional basic research, and to increase take-up of the proposed methods by policy analysts and empirical researchers.

The choice of residential location is a critical economic decision for households in the United States. Renters search for housing that best meets their needs given their budget. This includes considering affordability, the specifics of the apartment or house as well as desired neighborhood features. However, some renters may face discrimination from landlords and property managers. Housing market discrimination could steer renters into specific neighborhoods and distort the housing search process. This project seeks to understand how possible discrimination affects the search process. The team will conduct an innovative field experiment to see how discrimination affects housing searchers. The team will use the results to develop estimates of the social costs of discrimination in rental housing markets. The project will yield new insights to improve fair housing policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental research on discrimination on housing markets has ignored the role of housing search, making it difficult to disentangle the effect of discrimination behavior on household sorting from the effects of location characteristics. This project integrates a field experiment with an online rental housing platform with a welfare-theoretic framework that takes housing search into account. The field experiment will make use of an innovative use of supercomputing infrastructure to send inquiries to rental housing listings. By examining how landlords and property managers respond to rental inquiries, they will be able to evaluate the impacts of possible discrimination on the choice sets faced by some renters. The welfare-theoretic approach accounts for impacts of discrimination on multiple neighborhood characteristics. It is currently unclear whether discrimination disproportionately hinders the location decisions of households who have preferences for certain attributes of housing or neighborhoods: affordable housing, school quality, safe neighborhoods, or harmful pollution exposures. This project will examine whether certain types of renters are disproportionately affected by discriminatory behavior in the housing market. Finally, the project will give us more accurate estimates of the lost social welfare from housing discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project has significant intellectual merit and broad societal impact as it will contribute to our knowledge about the diversity in forms of rulership and authority through time and space. One of the leading topics in archaeology today is social complexity, or the study of variability in the forms of organization and authority in large-scale political systems. The project enriches this crucial field of study by investigating the emergence of divine rulership, in which certain humans come to be treated as god-like supernaturals, and their authority and being are seen as divine. The beginnings of this distinctive kind of political system, which has been common and continues today in world contexts, are not well understood archaeologically, especially for the Central Andes, one of the heartlands of Pre-Columbian civilization. The research project will bring insights into this important topic by uncovering primary archaeological evidence to monitor changes over time in leadership strategies and ways that rulers justified their authority, including claiming special connections with landscapes, ancestors, and supernatural beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three field seasons and detailed post-excavation studies will investigate the ancient political centers of Cerro San Isidro (Moro region, Nepena Valley) and Pashash (Pallasca region), and their surrounding hinterlands in the northern Ancash Department, Peru. Survey of regional settlement patterns, as well as excavation data from elite architecture, material culture, and funerary activities will allow comparison of pivotal cultural transformations leading to lordships. Excavations within walled house compounds and plaza areas will help to distinguish high-status and commoner activities. Analysis of skeletal remains from nearby tombs will help to characterize the individuals associated with the compounds. Studies of artifacts and coeval visual arts will offer insights into the role of ancestors in local ritual practices and the exercise of authority. Researching these data comparatively will illuminate how and when major forms of divine lordships took root in ancient Peru. Such polities were especially prominent in the study region where ancient lords, according to ethnohistorical chronicles, levied labor obligations from each household to coordinate collective tasks (irrigation, ritual, war), while having cosmological and moral duties to ensure order and the people's well-being. A leader's claim to legitimacy was pinned to his bloodline and link to an exalted founding ancestor. This kind of Andean social organization has three corollaries with key project implications: (1) a tendency, over time, for more groups to feature ancestors at the apex of their social hierarchy, (2) esteemed leaders come to share in the status of divinities, and (3) a critical innovation is the integration of the esteemed dead into the political life of nobles as they become institutionalized as regular actors in the socio-political system. The project will build fruitful links with local institutions (schools, museums) and hence add value to the management of Pre-Columbian cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made possible under the SBE-UKRI lead agency activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Record linkage is a perennial and challenging problem across the social sciences, with important applications in areas such as demography, economics, public health, and official statistics.  Plummeting costs of new forms of data collection and storage and the proliferation of ""big data"" have increased the need for merging such databases as researchers and statistical agencies struggle to integrate carefully curated datasets with messy and incomplete data from historical, administrative, and commercial sources.  The methods developed in this project will facilitate the successful integration of different data sources, thus generating new resources for future research.  These combined data sources may also provide some alternatives to expensive survey data collection in an era of declining response rates.  Freely available software will be developed and stored in a public repository.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing desire to deploy probabilistic record linkage has spurred significant research into various components of the process, such as how to compare records, how to reduce the number of record comparisons to keep the problem computationally feasible, how to quantify the weight of evidence for or against a link between records, and how to ultimately generate a merged database.  Often these components are studied in isolation from each other and from the ultimate goal of making inferences using the merged files.  This research project will take a more holistic view of the record linkage process in order to advance the state of the art.  The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to develop new models for record linkage that incorporate the impact of preprocessing methods that reduce the total number of record pairs to be evaluated.  While widely deployed and well motivated, these methods have effects on subsequent modeling that are not well understood.  The second goal is to enhance understanding of uncertainty and error throughout the process and to develop imputation methods for propagating error due to uncertain record links and other missing data, such as item nonresponse in a survey. These methods will be designed with an eye toward large applications that require new computational approaches.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

Eye movements tend to track with attention, and eye-tracking is a flexible tool for tracking eye movements. Despite the ubiquity and utility of eye-tracking methodology, current data analytic practices are limited. The methods to be developed are general and may be used to advance knowledge in other fields where comparable data are collected. The investigators will apply the new methods in interdisciplinary collaborative efforts with researchers from psycholinguistics, education, and computer science. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in these analytic techniques, and the results of this project will be disseminated to both specialized and multidisciplinary communities through journal articles, conferences, workshops, and a webinar. All findings, data, code, and software from this project will be made publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop statistical models for intensive categorical time series data with the complex temporal, spatial, and dependence structures exhibited by eye-tracking data.

The investigators will present a dynamic GLMM specification for binary data, which will indicate whether the participant is or is not fixating on a critical interest area at each moment in time. The investigators also will present a dynamic GLMM specification for ordered-category or partially ordered category data using an IRTree approach. This approach allows the researcher to examine cognitive processes which drive the choice among multiple stimuli for the eye to fixate on. To improve data analytic practices, methods using the dynamic GLMM will be developed following the sequence of the data analytic procedures: data description, model specification, model estimation, model selection, and model evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With these new methods, it is now possible to observe what people read and talk about, and thus think and feel about, a wide range of common objects and events. The goal of this project is to study how these novel methods and datasets can be combined with existing psychological theory to predict and understand human judgment, with the primary application to the domain of risk perception. The computational techniques proposed as part of this project allow for the automatic, large-scale analysis of the perception of naturalistic risks, and thus can be used to identify problems and develop interventions involving risk communication and risk management. More generally, by applying cutting edge methods in data science to the study of human behavior, this project develops novel technologies for predicting and understanding attitudes, beliefs, and preferences. By doing so, it facilitates a wide array of policy and commercial applications not feasible using existing empirical methodologies in the behavioral sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How can we uncover and quantify rich mental representations for all of the objects and concepts that are the target of everyday judgment? How can we use these rich representations to predict judgments and judgment errors, to study domain and individual-level differences in judgment, and to characterize the complex web of associations that underlie judgment? Finally, how can we study differences in mental representations and judgments across cultures and time periods? This project will use ""semantic vectors"" -- high dimensional representations for words obtained from large-scale language data -- to address these questions. Semantic vectors provide a good proxy for the structure of knowledge and association in people's minds and can be combined with various machine learning algorithms to predict judgments for naturalistic objects and concepts, such as sources of risk. These vectors can also identify the key associates of judgments, facilitating directed hypothesis tests for a diverse array of psychological dimensions, including emotions, moral concepts, and personality. Finally, when trained on different types of language datasets, semantic vectors can shed light on the complex interaction between judgment and culture, history, and society. Note that semantic vectors can be used in this manner for nearly any judgment domain that involves common objects, individuals, and events. Thus one key goal of this project is to evaluate the applicability of semantic vectors for predicting and understanding the many different types of judgments that that people make on a day-to-day basis (including not only risk judgment, but also, for example, health judgment and consumer judgment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to understand what effect socio-political conflict and migration in the Mesoamerican region had upon people's relationship to landscape, territory, and social identities in Ixil Postclassic communities. To study the development of Ixil identity, research will focus on the regional settlement patterns, architecture, and artifacts of the Ixil, in comparison to those of other Maya groups in the region. Through archaeological, archival, and ethnographic investigation, researchers will examine Ixil settlement patterns and ancient materiality to determine if Ixil people were in isolation or in contact with other Maya groups in the area, and whether they formed networks or maintained autonomy with respect to diverse Maya groups in the area during the Postclassic Period.

However, information can be manipulated or concealed to change the receiver's beliefs. This research project will use laboratory experiments to test whether competition among economic agents encourage transparency.  In these experiments, agents send information to persuade or influence a decision maker.  The study proceeds in two steps.  In the first experiment, only one person at a time, without competition, sends information to the decision maker.  In the second experiment, two competing people send information to the decision maker.   There is no prediction of full information revelation in the first experiment, while theory predicts full information revelation in the second. These design differences allows the researchers to test whether competition leads to information transparency.   The results of this research project will provide a test of one of the fundamental assumptions about competition which is the foundation of most market economies.  The results will also provide guidance on designing mechanisms to elicit transparency in economic interactions, thus improve the efficiency of the US economy, growth, and income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research will build on Bayesian persuasion and use laboratory experiments to test whether competition leads to transparency in information transmission.  Conventional wisdom suggests that competition between agents will encourage transparency.  The PIs will test this in a lab experiment in which two agents individually provide information in different ways, to influence a decision maker.   The PIs develop a model in which the two senders of information have zero sum utilities and expect the first sender to reveal the truth.  If s/he conceals the truth, competitive theory predicts that the second agent will send the opposite signal and the receiver is likely to follow the more precise information.  The base model is one in which only one agent at a time sends information to the decision maker.  The experiments will test these theoretical predictions and will serve to validate the theory as well as provide guidance on behavioral factors that affect transparency.  Besides testing the theoretical assumption of information transparency, this research will provide guidance on mechanism design to enhance information transparency.

Vast amounts of information on bodies and objects in motion is now collected at very high spatial and temporal resolutions. These data have the potential to inform critical areas related to global movements of humans and goods, disease outbreak, impact of transportation changes on urban traffic, or effects of human activity on endangered species. Effective visual representations of motion are needed to reveal and communicate complex patterns and processes of societal importance.

The assumptions underlying this project is that such limitations may be overcome by (a) exploiting private risk to achieve greater cooperation, building upon the ""veil of ignorance"" concept of John Rawls to foster cooperation for public goods; (b) departing from the pitfalls of either extreme of public or private goods only by focusing on sharing of privately-owned resources; and (c) exploring how information and social-networks increase cooperation as well as encouraging private investments in mitigation technologies. To test these concepts, the researchers have chosen as context a major disaster of natural origin: toxic levels of arsenic in groundwater pumped by millions of private wells across Bangladesh. Information on individual risk, in this case well tests for arsenic, are provided in ways that encourage greater cooperation and investment through the sharing of safe wells and the installation of new safe wells. The findings have implications for environmental policy in the United States as high-resolution data on water, air, and soil quality become increasingly accessible to citizens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this research studies the role of risk-sharing and social networks in perception and mitigation of local environmental risks. The research team focuses on two aspects: increasing cooperation for risk mitigation and increasing private investment in risk mitigation technology. This project is based in a setting where these two factors become particularly important due to a lack of government-provided resources for reducing environmental risk. The research first tests whether informal insurance, where compliance may be primarily enforced by existing social structure and reciprocity norms, can effectively counter the undersupply of local public goods. Then, the team studies how social-networks can help in increasing cooperation, adoption and investment in risk mitigation technology. To understand the channels, this project explores  how information on risk can facilitate more cooperation and risk mitigation. This relatively low-cost approach is different from the current approach of the government of Bangladesh which is focused on expensive infrastructure of limited reach. The study is a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, where the researchers randomly assign interventions on (a) ex-ante risk sharing, (b) information provision on risk, and (c) the demonstration of intermediate-depth wells which yield low arsenic. The original data allow the research team to test the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of mitigation efforts and reduction in arsenic exposure to the population. The experimental design allows for documentation of the causal impact of the interventions. The research team intends to share the results with policy makers and organizations so that lessons learnt here can be applied in similar settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine the impact of recent declines in state support for public universities on scientific research output. Since the Great Recession, several states cut appropriations to higher education, and nineteen states have not restored funding to 2008 levels. Yet few studies have examined the relationship between federal and non-federal research funding, and none have investigated the relationship between state funding for higher education and research output. In addition, researchers have debated whether there are diminishing returns to science funding. Diminishing returns occur when each additional dollar of funding results in fewer publications and citations. The results of this research will allow policymakers to make informed decisions about the allocation of scarce funding resources to higher education at the state and federal levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will examine the effect of changes in support for higher education funding to examine the returns to science funding in terms of publications and citations across science and social science disciplines. First, the project will use new data that links publications, citations and grants to individual faculty members at research universities to model the returns to scale of science funding across several disciplines. Variation across these fields will shed light on the returns to scale in science funding. Second, the project will examine whether state funding of higher education is a substitute or complement for federal research funding in the production of research output measured by publications and citations. If state funding is a complement for federal research funding, one would expect that federal research dollars would fall in states that experienced budget cuts. Third, the project will use individual level data on scientists and state budget shocks to higher education funding to examine the impact of faculty mobility on the research productivity of sending and receiving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given estimates of $83 billion in economic losses, Hurricane Irma will likely join this list. Hurricanes threaten the sustainability of entire communities: recovery is often slow or incomplete, residents may be permanently displaced, and physical destruction may cause long-term economic hardship. Human losses, including mental and physical health outcomes, may be affected by structural damage to the community and by individual- and community-level choices made before, during and after the hurricane reaches land. Yet many deleterious consequences of hurricanes may be mitigated through more effective and appropriately targeted evacuation efforts, improved decision making, and building codes/practices. Prior research suggests that human responses to hurricanes are influenced by variability in storm exposure, demographics, prior evacuation behavior, and type and perceived trustworthiness of disaster messaging. Moreover, real-time perceptions of risk may be related to actual wind and storm surge conditions and ongoing evolving damage to infrastructure, as well as to how these events are communicated. The investigators in this project have been at the forefront of developing and maintaining a sample (with prior NSF support) of Florida residents, including both pre- and post-Irma mental, physical, psychological and behavioral responses. This project examines how physical indicators of the storm and media exposure interact and influence those responses. To facilitate future mitigation efforts in places vulnerable to hurricanes and other hazards, gaining an integrated understanding of the physical nature of, and human responses to, these devastating storms is critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, an interdisciplinary team of investigators leverages a recent NSF RAPID-funded survey of a representative sample of Florida residents in the 3 days before Hurricane Irma made landfall across the State of Florida and again a few weeks after the storm passed. The team examines the role played by the physical parameters of the storm (wind, surge, damage) and media communications in understanding psychological and behavioral responses to the hurricane. The investigators collect relevant time-stamped physical and media data in places where the sample resided in the days leading up to and after Hurricane Irma made landfall. The researchers explore three questions: 1) What are the effects of spatially- and temporally-varying winds and surge that result in varying and evolving damage on the evolving perception and decisions made by people affected by these physical inputs? 2) What proportion of individual variability in pre-storm risk perceptions, decisions, and distress levels are accounted for by these physical inputs compared to respondents' personal histories, exposure to previous risks, exposure to evolving media communications, and other non-meteorological, non-damage factors? and, 3) To what extent is variability in the post-hurricane response a function of the decision to evacuate, exposure to evolving media communications, or other psychosocial variables, as compared to physical parameters of the storm? Results will inform decision making about the allocation of resources for disaster preparation, mobilization, and recovery, as well as provide emergency managers and other officials with insight into how to improve responses to future severe weather events. The integration of physical parameters, media, and human response data leads to increased sustainability of at-risk communities, while also informing theories and policies relevant to other natural disasters."

The light that reflects from a visible surface toward the point of observation is influenced by several factors. These include the surface shape, the pattern of illumination, and the nature of the surface material. The problem for perceptual theory is to explain how it is possible to tease apart these separate influences in order to make reliable judgments about each one. This project is designed to investigate how this is achieved by human observers. There are many potential benefits of this research. The accurate perception of shape and material properties are important for many basic human functions, such as grasping objects or judging whether visible surfaces are appropriate to afford safe locomotion. A better understanding of these processes may help to facilitate training to avoid injury due to falling. It could also lead to improved 3D visualization in medical devices, or aids for visually impaired individuals that can detect slippery spots or irregular terrain features in the path of locomotion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first specific aim of this proposal is to measure how the perception of 3D shape is influenced by changes in surface material (e.g., glass, wax or plastic) or the pattern of illumination. This will be achieved by measuring local 3D orientation at numerous probe points on an object, from which it possible to compute a best fitting surface that is most consistent with an observer's judgments. The second specific aim is to measure how the perceptual categorization of surface materials is influenced by changes in 3D shape and the pattern of illumination. This will be achieved using a novel categorization task in which observers are shown a shaded object, and are required to adjust a set of sliders to indicate their confidence that the depicted material is one of several possible material categories. The stimuli for these experiments will be created using state-of-the-art computer graphics to produce physically accurate simulations of real materials. The results of this research will greatly improve our current understanding of the specific computational mechanisms by which patterns of image shading provide information for perceiving the 3D shapes of objects and the identification of their material properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Arabic contrasts three types of sounds: plain dental, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants. For dentals, the tongue tip touches the upper teeth, while pharyngeals have a constriction in the throat. Emphatic consonants combine the dental and pharyngeal constrictions and sound similar to plain dentals to those who do not speak Arabic. Speakers must recognize the differences between these consonants to distinguish words with important meaning differences (such as between the Arabic words for 'member' and 'enemy'). The acoustic characteristics of these consonants are not well understood. This research tests the hypothesis that listeners identify these consonants through their effects on adjacent and non-adjacent vowels within the same word. This project will explore how speakers produce and identify plain, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants in Palestinian Arabic. The outcomes of this project can improve language recognition programs, develop teaching materials for learners of Arabic, and inform our understanding of human language processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data will be collected through production and perception experiments. For the production experiments, native speakers will record words containing plain dental, emphatic, or pharyngeal consonants. The investigator will measure acoustic characteristics of these consonants and of adjacent and non-adjacent vowels to explore how these consonant classes differ, how they affect adjacent vowels, if they affect different vowels, and whether their effects extend to the whole word or only the adjacent vowel. The findings of the production experiments will be used to conduct a perception experiment that tests how speakers use these acoustic cues to distinguish the different classes of consonants. The combination of experiments will identify which effects are crucial to distinguish these classes, and the comparison to pharyngeals may provide clues about the articulation of emphatic consonants.

These differences are central to understanding economic development and structural change, and this research focuses on one potentially important determinant: managerial capital. The context is post-war Japan, a setting that offers both a large-scale natural experiment and extremely rich data. During the occupation of Japan, Allied Forces implemented an ""economic purge"" of senior managers in large Japanese firms. Managers who had been employed at any time between 1937 and 1945 at firms with a net worth of over one hundred million yen were subjected to mandatory removal from their posts and barred from managerial positions in other large firms. They typically moved to firms in newer industries, which were not dominated by large conglomerates. The purge may have lowered economic performance by depriving Japan's large firms of scarce talent, or alternatively may have cleared the way for younger, innovative leaders to gain a foothold. It could have also promoted innovation by channeling talent into newer, rising industries, which tended to be exempt from the purge. However, if managerial capital is primarily embedded in organizational norms rather than in individuals, the purge may have had limited effects. This research estimates the impacts of the purge by comparing firms whose managers were purged to firms who barely avoided the purge by being just below the one hundred-million-yen cutoff. It also examines the performance of the firms to which purged managers moved. Finally, for those managers at branches that operated in colonial Taiwan, it examines whether ongoing connections with former Taiwanese employees helped these employees to subsequently transition into industries related to those of their former Japanese managers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the investigators use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impacts of the purge on the firms whose managers were removed and on the firms to which these managers moved. The latter requires constructing a control group consisting of firms to which managers just below the cutoff would have plausibly transitioned had they been purged. This can be done by using archival data to estimate a model of manager transitions that includes rich individual, firm, and network level characteristics. This research also exploits the same plausibly exogenous variation to test whether managerial connections helped Taiwanese entrepreneurs to also transition into these industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Integrative research has the potential to lead to improvements in language technologies, especially in low-resource settings where success depends most on the capacity to generalize in linguistically appropriate ways from limited data. It also has potential to lead to scientific breakthroughs in understanding the sorts of computations and hidden representations that underlie human language learning.

These Hongshan societies represented the early stages in the evolution of forms of organization that integrated the people of different local communities into networks of social, political, and economic relationships. They thus represent the very beginnings of the much larger-scale, highly integrated societies in which most of the world's population now lives. These regional societies were still very small; each including only 1,000 people or so in a territory about 10 km across. Some families clearly enjoyed more social prestige and influence than others, attributable primarily to their special religious and ritual roles. Dozens if not hundreds of such small regional societies were connected with each other through a common focus on a complex of extraordinary ceremonial structures in which very highly prestigious individuals were buried. This complex at Niuheliang seems to have functioned primarily as a religious pilgrimage center, with a relatively small community of permanent residents, who lived in a hilly region with very little agricultural potential. Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, doctoral candidate Weiyu Ran will carry out fieldwork at the nearby Hongshan-period village of Shangchaoyanggou to investigate how the provisioning of this pilgrimage center was organized. Several villages, of which Shangchaoyanggou was one, were located a few kilometers from the ritual facilities of Niuheliang  in much more favorable locations for farming and may have specialized in producing food to sustain the nearby pilgrimage center. If this is the kind of organization that had emerged in Hongshan times, it represented a major step toward more highly developed economies and greater interdependence between households and local communities than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Ran will evaluate this hypothetical reconstruction of early Hongshan economies and the organization that sustained the pilgrimage center at Niuheliang by collecting data on the cultural remains left behind thousands of years ago by the inhabitants of Shangchaoyanggou. The parts of this refuse that have been preserved for so long are mostly fragments of broken pottery vessels and stone tools. If Shangchaoyanggo focused heavily on agricultural production then the data Mr. Ran collects will show high proportions of agricultural tools and low proportions of the elaborate pottery vessels that signaled social prestige (when compared to the artifacts of ordinary Hongshan communities or to those remaining at residential locations near the most important ritual structures). If this is what the research results show, it will be clear that in at least some instances  a very early focus on religion and ritual as a principal means of social integration can lead to the development of the more advanced economic systems upon which even larger-scale political integration eventually was based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project advances the nation's prosperity and welfare by helping us to understand better how the practice of memorialization mediates how our nation grapples with the darkest moments of its past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-wave longitudinal survey of the local city's residents will be used around the opening of a new memorial to capture a pre- and post- measure of social and political attitudes. The survey will be used to: (1) assess how the memorial affects the community and individuals socially, emotionally, and politically; (2) explore how the memorial's representation affects attitudes toward intergroup relations; (3) reveal how that individuals' social positions (i.e., race, class, gender, etc.) influence how they interpret and interact with the memorial; and, (4) explicitly measure social and geo-spatial effects of a physical representation of violence. Whether the results demonstrate a net positive or a net negative effect of the memorial, the research will highlight the impact on present identity representations and intergroup relations. Findings also will be useful to those involved in the opening and managing of such memorials, and those considering their construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data are used to investigate how tax policy characteristics may moderate the known effects of diversity on voters' willingness to pay for public spending.  The results will yield new insights into what makes for a sustainable revenue source.  This is crucial for enabling American society to meet the fiscal challenges of the future, and thus for the health, prosperity and welfare of American society as well as for national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the assembly and digitization of revenue measures presented to local voters since 1986. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques then are applied to classify these measures and to identify features of the text that mediate the observed associations between diversity and reported election outcomes. The most general goal of the project is to identify institutional mechanisms that moderate associations between social context and public spending. A more specific goal is to identify the causes of the well-known negative association between diversity and public spending on health, welfare, and other social transfers and services. The project thereby advances theoretical understanding of the dimensions of policy that affect voting behavior. It also analyzes institutional mechanisms that yield one of the most important observed patterns in fiscal sociology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Police departments rely increasingly on various policing technologies, including the use of biometric and spatial profiling data. Yet there is little research on the interplay of these policing technologies and their social and geographic impacts on local communities, particularly communities of color. Understanding how these technologies impact children's perceptions of policing, identity, place, and personal security have the potential of improving law enforcement and public well-being. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising young scholar to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will examine perceptions and spatial interactions between police and children from minority groups. Specifically, this research asks, what are the spatial interactions between law-enforcement and children from minority communities, and what are the impacts on children's well-being of those interactions. The doctoral student will use a mixed-method approach to collect data through interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. Children's perceptions and spatial interactions will be understood via the production of visual interpretive materials such as drawings, comics, and mental maps. Findings will be presented in community workshops, community-council meetings and police-community meetings in ways designed to open dialog regarding police policies, practices, and community impacts.

This insect species is also a vector for other viral diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and urban yellow fever. The geographical expansion of the vector A. aegypti and the interconnectedness of the planet are all matters that increase the concern about mosquito-borne diseases in global attempts to govern and secure life. In the wake of the Zika outbreak, the World Health Organization endorsed pilot implementations of modified mosquitoes as a new vector control tool. The project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, explores several such pilot efforts to modify A. aegypti. Further, it would broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in science, build capacity and scientific infrastructure through international scientific cooperation, and enhance public scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations engaged in public health policies for mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luisa Castro, under the supervision of the Dr. Stepfan Helmreich of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will explore different models of modifying A. aegypti, with the aim of evaluating whether different scalar approaches impact understandings of health outcomes and anthropogenic processes. International and local media marked Brazil as the epicenter of the 2016 Zika epidemic. In the last years, the country has also been struggling with dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever outbreaks. However, these diseases are not only a problem for endemic countries like Brazil. This research will be conducted in different regions in Brazil, in order to ethnographically investigate three scientific projects that strive biologically to modify A. aegypti in order to deploy them to control local populations of these insects. Each project implements a different type of modification: one infects A. aegypti with the Wolbachia bacterium to curtail the mosquito's ability to transmit viruses; the other irradiates the mosquito to sterilize it; and yet, a third genetically engineers the mosquito to limit its reproduction. By accompanying researchers and workers in their daily practices between lab and field, the researcher will collect data on the efforts to develop these technologies, and the imaginaries and justificatory logics that surround their implementation. Person-centered interviews, a technique used frequently in psychological anthropology, among a sample of 60-75. She will also investigate how modified mosquitoes conform and rearrange Brazilian policies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases, historically oriented around human behavioral reforms and toxic chemicals. Being attentive to the professional experiences and training of those involved in these projects, she will also observe how scientists, lab workers, and government officials assess methodologies, formulate theoretical engagements, and frame their political positions and personal aspirations in their goal to transform research into health applications. This project proposes to trace the confluence of natural, scientific, and political agendas, practices, and strategies, particularly in the context of diseases. It will provide specificity to analytical reflections on social-cultural drivers of anthropogenic processes and the solutions proposed to mitigate their effects. The project aims to develop a historically-informed critical theory of health around mosquito-borne diseases that takes seriously the environmental dynamics, politics, and social power relations that inform these interactions. In times of growing anxieties about mosquito-borne diseases, and burgeoning solutions of how to control them, an ethnographically rich account can contribute to debates to develop more comprehensive, reflective, and effective policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
James,J,Gross,gross@stanford.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,08/31/2022,448689.00,"People often respond emotionally to the dramatic socio-political events that are taking place around the word. This is especially true when such events are occurring in well-established democracies and at home, and not just in faraway countries. In many cases, expressing strong emotions can create and perpetuate conflicts with others who may be responding to these events in very different ways. Acknowledging the importance of emotions in intergroup conflicts has led to recent attempts to reduce conflict-related emotions using psychological interventions. Initial studies show that these efforts can be helpful in reducing destructive emotions and promoting conflict resolution. However, it is not typically possible to apply interventions to an entire population. Instead, interventions must be applied to a portion or subgroup of the population. This project examines whether reducing a subgroup's emotions can have a long-lasting influence on the overall group's emotions and level of conflict. The goal of the project is to find ways to optimize psychological interventions and reduce harmful conflict.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Three studies use the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a case study. The first study examines the unfolding of negative emotional dynamics within groups. Recent developments in computer science are utilized to create an online network that allows the examination of real-time, online interactions. The second study examines how these emotional dynamics are influenced by emotion regulation interventions applied to different portions of the group. This will enable the identification of the conditions under which interventions achieve maximum utility in influencing overall negative group emotions. The third study tests the long-term effects of the emotion regulation interventions and assesses how these effects are influenced by emotional dynamics. The research will make an important contribution to maximizing the scalability of psychological interventions and achieving the long-term aim of reducing harmful conflict.  Immediate applications resulting from the project can be facilitated by the Stanford Center for Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions (SPARQ), which provides consultation to many organizations interested in psychological interventions. A collaboration with researchers at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) in Herzliya, Israel provides additional opportunities for implementation and dissemination. The project includes the development of an open source platform that can be utilized by researchers in many fields, thereby advancing other areas of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Mark Hauser at Northwestern University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist conducting a spatial-historical analysis of agricultural and protected lands. Through an investigation of landscape changes in a biodiversity hotspot over the last 75 years, this research generates knowledge about 1) the emergence and effects of inequalities in areas marked by conservation and 2) the ways people respond to conservation in their decisions about land and forest use. As economic hardship and land shortages worsen, it is likely that human pressures on the forest will increase. The research offers an understanding of the broader trends that make life difficult for both people and the forest, which is knowledge that can improve current U.S. efforts to support conservation and development. In addition, this project involves researchers and undergraduate research assistants from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>The project maps the phenomenon by which families no longer have enough land to provide for their basic needs through the largely agricultural means available to them. Specifically, it documents the material record using techniques borrowed from survey archaeology, including GPS-based transect walks; aerial photography, and archival research. The project builds on ethnographic findings to map patterns of population density, land tenure, and land use (crop planting) along the borders of the protected area. The project uses these methods to identify the connections among the establishment of protected areas, population growth, decisions about land, and socio-economic inequality. Moreover, this research produces maps that serve as a bridge between insights from ethnography, archival research, rigorous social theory, and the conservation sciences. Human dimensions of natural resource management is a growing subfield in the environmental sciences, and this project fits squarely into that interdisciplinary endeavor. While conservation scientists have recognized the importance of social research for decades, however, attempts to generate knowledge about human-environment relationships that successfully integrate ecological and social understandings continue to encounter hurdles. This project directly works to overcome those hurdles through a synergistic, multidisciplinary collaboration. It offers a holistic understanding of the broader political-ecological trends shaping prosperity of both the people and the protected forest. The project thus advances knowledge on conservation and natural resources by creating avenues for linguistic, sociocultural, archaeological, and ecological collaboration at the theoretical, methodological, and dissemination stages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, decision makers in the insurance industry are faced with rising climate risks, which must be properly measured and managed. Changes in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, floods, intense precipitation, droughts, wind storms, and other rare but influential natural events can massively impact total insured losses. Also, climate can lead to changes in human health through shifting exposures to heat or drought, changing air quality, and shifts towards more favorable conditions for disease. This workshop addresses how climate risks can be better measured and managed by the insurance industry.

Managing the transnational flow of people is one of the greatest challenges facing nation-states in the 21st century, requiring governments to negotiate complex issues of sovereignty, national security, and human safety and well being. PICs present a potentially promising approach to regulating transnational mobility as they are often less expensive and easier to implement than traditional enforcement strategies. However, little is known about the use of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement. This project contributes to research in the field of political geography by producing new empirical data on an under-examined enforcement mechanism, while also contributing to theoretical understandings of how nation-states govern. The findings of this project will have implications for national security, ensuring that border enforcement efforts are effective, economically efficient, and safe. The dissemination plan, including a publicly available website and StoryMap, will enable public engagement and science communication while also providing easily accessible information for migration research and education. Graduate research assistants within the project team will also promote the development and training of a diverse and competitive workforce in the geographical sciences.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three objectives: 1) to trace the development of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement; 2) to map the spatial and institutional frameworks through which PICs have been created and distributed and how these distribution networks relate to the form, content, and effectiveness of campaigns; and 3) to identify the role PICs play in producing political geographies of border enforcement.  A mixed-methods, comparative approach is used to achieve these objectives.  Research methods include textual analysis, semi-structured interviews, and geo-visualization techniques that combines quantitative and qualitative data sets. A comparative approach is useful when examining border and immigration enforcement strategies for it illustrates the nuances of enforcement in distinct contexts, while also providing insight into how national governments communicate and collaborate. Comparison of case studies in the US and Australia will enable the researchers to explore how specific cultural, economic, political, and geographic contexts affects the development and implementation of PICs as a mechanism of border enforcement, illuminating the potential of this strategy across contexts and providing insight on the best practices for effectively mobilizing PICs as an enforcement strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Species of this group occur more broadly and in larger numbers than any other non-human primate in the fossil record of Africa. Fossils have been found in southern, eastern, and northern Africa, the Middle East, Spain, and even India, an unusual distribution for any primate group besides humans. The living representatives of this group, however, are only found in the highlands of Ethiopia. Because of their overlap with humans in the past, these monkeys have often been suggested as a model for understanding human evolution. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of gelada monkeys will not just provide better insight into the evolution of this group but will also advance the study of human evolution.

Morphometric data in the form of 3D landmarks and 2D measurements, as well as morphological data in the form of character states, will be collected. Genetic data will also be collected, thereby resulting in a large, integrated dataset for this primate group. This comprehensive dataset will then be used to: assess the morphological as well as genetic differences among the living populations of Theropithecus gelada; inform research on fossil populations; provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Theropithecus; investigate the dietary trends seen in this genus and their relationship to cranio-dental morphological trends; and investigate the cause of the extreme facial morphology exhibited by some species of this genus and evaluate whether that is related to diet, sexual selection or some other factor.

However, additional comparative data on brain metabolism (the rate at which energy is used) are needed to better investigate these potential trade-offs. Because direct measurements are difficult to obtain for most living species and impossible for extinct ones, this doctoral dissertation project will use measurements obtained from skeletal features affected by brain metabolic demands to infer rates of brain metabolism in a broad group of mammals. Comparing how and why mammals may vary in the energy they expend on the brain relative to their body's metabolism will advance knowledge in primate and human biology and brain evolution. This project will generate numerous 3D scans of skulls that will be used for student mentoring and public outreach at Duke University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. These data will also be released for public access on the digital archive MorphoSource, which will yield further research and educational utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies suggest that the size of foramina that transmit the brain's arteries may be used to predict brain glucose utilization rates in euarchontans. This project aims to further evaluate the use of these foramina to test energetic hypotheses of brain size evolution. Diameters of the transverse foramina (which transmit the vertebral artery) and carotid canals (which transmit the internal carotid artery) will be measured from osteological and 3-D digitized specimens obtained from high-resolution computed tomography scans, respectively, in a broad taxonomic sample of marsupials, glirans, afrotheres, xenarthrans, and some carnivorans. A study of bony canal area and predicted blood flow rate change through ontogeny in a cadaveric osteological sample of humans will also be conducted to further elucidate the relationship between foramen size, brain size, and brain metabolism. Using these data, this project will test the extent to which large brains in primates and other mammals are sustained by increasing the body's metabolic rate.

The Islamic Period (ca. AD 800-1400) marked a time of transformation in the Horn of Africa: In the span of a few centuries, urban centers emerged along the Somali coast and thousands of ancestral Somali pastoralists converted to Islam. Previous scholarship on religious change has centered on large-scale, sedentary agricultural societies. Africanist scholars, for example, have effectively demonstrated the importance of Islam in the history of eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean World, focusing predominantly on the sedentary societies of the Swahili coast. Through the archaeology of pastoralist settlements in Djibouti, this project focuses instead on seasonally mobile pastoralist societies, and the ways in which their economic networks, political systems, and local ecologies defined the conditions and limits of religious transformation. Ultimately, this research seeks to answer two related questions: How did local actors influence or participate in the process (i.e., timing and nature) of religious change in Djibouti? Specifically, how did local actors shape the creation and use of religious spaces through time? This project is well positioned to address these questions because it utilizes archaeological methodologies that allow the systematic collection and analysis of material evidence related to religious practices across space and time. This project is significant because it will shed new light on the process of Islamic Period religious change in the Horn of Africa, and more broadly on the nature of religious change among mobile, pastoralist societies. The issue of religion and religious change is relevant, and often violence related, in many regions of the world today and the results of this research have the potential to shed interpretive light on current day processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine how and when Islam spread to seasonally mobile pastoralist communities living along the Somali Coast by mapping the organization and evolution of religious infrastructures across pastoralist landscapes. It will be conducted in eastern Djibouti, an important area in the spread of Islam from the Arabian Peninsula through the Horn of Africa. Under the supervision of Dr. Norman, Bassett will examine the spatial and diachronic patterning of Islamic Period structures and artifacts at a large, pastoralist seasonal aggregation site in the Ambouli River drainage of eastern Djibouti. This project will test the hypothesis that pastoralist political economies - and the social and religious institutions at their center - influenced how pastoralists integrated Islam into their daily routines and seasonal settlement practices. As the first study in eastern Africa to date pre-Islamic and Islamic-Period stone structures using a combination of OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) and AMS radiocarbon dating methods, this project will develop the first detailed chronology for the integration of Islamic architectural elements into archaeological sites along the Somali coast. By establishing a solid chronological sequence for Islamic architectural elements, this project will bolster understandings of when and how eastern Africa's rural pastoralist societies converted to Islam and improve general chronologies for the spread of Islam in Africa. In so doing, this project will make significant contributions to anthropological theory by extending the scope of research on religious change to include pastoral societies and their political economies. Finally, one broader impact of this project will be the creation of a database of information about pre-Islamic and Islamic Period archaeological sites and structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Under the sponsorship of Dr. David Pellow at the University of California, Santa Barbara, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating inequalities in environmental exposure for under-represented minority (URM) groups. While researchers have quantitatively documented how URM groups are disproportionately exposed to environmental harms, the qualitative forces and mechanisms that underpin this inequality remain underexplored. This project has the potential to create societal benefits by discovering solutions to environmental problems that disproportionately affect URM populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, Investigating Inequality in Environmental Exposure, will advance knowledge within the fields of environmental studies and sociology by exploring how regulations shape the distribution of environmental harms. While the statistical association between race and toxic exposure has been well documented, few studies have examined the social forces that create and sustain these environmental inequalities. In contrast, this project uses qualitative and ethnographic methods to generate explanations for why environmental inequalities persist and why URM populations continue to be disproportionately exposed to environmental harms. This project focuses on a single agricultural industry in which hazardous labor and environmental practices are highly correlated with race. Based on this case study, the project hypothesizes that the following factors are likely to co-construct the context that shapes regulatory enforcement and compliance: 1) farmland characteristics, 2) state capacity, 3) producers' access to credit and technology, 4) labor availability, and 5) market volatility. The research team will collect data through interviews and ethnographic observations with agricultural producers and state regulators. Research findings will illuminate the challenges of improving environmental outcomes for URM populations by providing a comprehensive examination of the origins of environmental problems, bottlenecks that impede solutions, and pathways for resolving problems. There are potentially transformative aspects of the proposed work, which if successful, could generate new knowledge on why URM populations are unevenly exposed to environmental harms, thus laying the groundwork for future scholars to replicate findings, test new hypotheses, and identify relationships in other societies or nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent decades these programs have increased in popularity, and an increasing number of parallel PES programs have been deployed to mitigate environmental degradation and the over-exploitation of natural resources. PES programs are often implemented concurrently in the same temporal and spatial context, yet little understanding exists about the mechanisms, pathways, and social and ecological effects of such interacting, parallel PES programs. This project will analyze how and why parallel PES programs interact with one another and with the corresponding coupled natural and human system. This work will result in generating insight into the potential, often unintended, social and ecological consequences. PES programs may impact human migration, investment in education, and other connections between local households and the physical environment. Furthermore, the project will address how such programs may affect changes in land cover, land use, and species habitat over time. This project will benefit society by addressing the interactions between development conservation policy and the effectiveness of governmental investments made in PES programs. This project's broader impacts also extend to innovative education and outreach activities that mentor K-12 students and their teachers, creative use of new geospatial technologies for effective monitoring and conservation of endangered wildlife, development of a student-centered pedagogy that enhances understanding of complex human-environment systems, and the development of a related movie and a web-based PES Center to disseminate project results.  The research will train graduate students and foster collaboration between U.S. and Chinese scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to understand the reciprocal relationship between parallel PES programs, shedding light on the related social and ecological consequences of these programs over space and time. The PIs will answer the following questions: (1) Through what pathways or mediating variables do parallel PES programs, through their influence on human and natural subsystems, affect one another? (2) Where and to what extent do parallel PES programs lead to net changes in the environment? (3) How has and will the human-environment system evolve over space and time given these interventions? Within the human subsystem the PIs will focus on the impacts of migration and job opportunities, as well as the educational investments of participating households. Within the natural subsystem, the PIs will document and monitor land cover and land use change, as well as occupancy and habitat of major mammal species using an unmanned aerial vehicle, camera trapping, and satellite imaging techniques. Lastly, the PIs will develop a complex systems framework, which consists of geospatial and statistical analyses, structural equation modeling, and development of an agent-based model (ABM) integrating qualitative and quantitative data and models across various spatial and temporal scales. Although this project will use data from Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China, the research will provide insights and approaches for understanding the mechanisms behind parallel PES programs in many coupled natural and human systems, substantially improving the science, technology, and practical effectiveness of PES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a new dataset and algorithms to identify and categorize medical information that remains true to the original meaning or undergoes distortion. Instead of imposing an external true/false label on this information, this project looks into a series of changes within the news coverage itself that gradually lead to a deviation from the original medical claims. Identifying important differences between original medical articles and news stories is a challenging, high risk-high reward venture. Broader impacts of this work include benefits to the research community by making novel contributions to understanding temporal changes in natural language information, as well as social benefits in the form of improved informational tools like question-answering. For the medical domain in particular, understanding temporal distortions and deviations from actual medical findings can reduce occurrences of harmful health choices, for instance, by embedding the research outcomes in news, social media, or search engines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a large dataset of medical scientific publications, and record their characteristics as they change over time across news by designing and developing discrete time-series representations of entities and their attributes and relations. This task will provide the basis for designing and implementing machine learning tasks that exploit stylometric features in natural language in conjunction with temporal distributions to identify and categorize such changes. This research will go beyond current approaches limited to true/false classification of individual articles, and hence be able to identify and analyze information change in narratives, including semantic changes and nuances, or selective emphasis of related information. The research entails an unsupervised and a semi-supervised machine learning approach with bootstrapping, and exploring a binary labeling task to distinguish distorted pieces of information from those that are faithful to the scientific finding, and a multi-label categorization to learn the type of semantic change occurring through time. The dataset will be disseminated via an archival location for natural language processing resources such as the Linguistic Data Consortium (https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/) to facilitate long-term availability to other researchers, and BitBucket or GitHub will be used to ensure the development, maintenance, sharing, and archiving of code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although some research has been conducted on these issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) departments, little knowledge has transferred over to professional schools and other disciplines, which play a key role in economic growth, such as in ""big data"" and entrepreneurial jobs. Addressing these gaps, this workshop will gather interdisciplinary experts to discuss the state of organizational science regarding gender equality, career success, and work-life inclusion in business schools and understudied contexts. The results of the workshop will help advance gender diversity, and women?s and minorities' career success in universities, business, and society by identifying scientific gaps, prioritizing studies; and addressing an under-researched critical area of organizational science. The research agenda developed will encourage future interdisciplinary scholarship on gender equality and work-life inclusion that can help policymakers to engage in evidence-based practices. New insights will be fostered on the organizational science regarding how to foster more gender and work-life inclusive businesses and universities and will advance scientific knowledge on strategies enhancing the attraction, advancement, retention, and career longevity of women faculty; and addressing societal inequality. The workshop products include a website and publications that will be disseminated to the public and policymakers. This workshop addresses a critical national policy area related to increasing labor market equality for women and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite growing scientific attention to advancing women and minorities in universities generally, and in professional schools specifically, the gender and related work-life inclusion picture remains bleak. Addressing gender inequality requires greater dual scientific inquiry into the science of organizations involving the more effective implementation of formal work-life policies such as extending the tenure clock or dual career hire incentives, and the creation of ""work-life inclusive climates."" A work-life inclusive climate is defined as one where a faculty member would not feel s/he would have to sacrifice their family and non-work identities in order to succeed in the job role. The goals of this interdisciplinary workshop is (1) to assess work-life and career issues and linkages to faculty gender inclusion and diversity in business schools and understudied contexts from an organizational science perspective; (2) to define the scientific terrain of faculty gender and work-life inclusion and intersectionality linkages; (3) to increase knowledge of the science of fostering gender, work-life inclusion, career success and organizational change in understudied faculty contexts; and (4) to foster interdisciplinary conversation with thought leaders, researchers and exemplary key decision-makers in order to identify scientific antecedents, outcomes and future research gaps.

One reason for this lag might be that American students are first introduced to a second language relatively late, often not until high school or college. Learning a second language at these ages can be quite challenging, in part because of the extensive linguistic knowledge that young adults already have in their native language. The goal of the present research is to better understand how different types of native language knowledge influence second language word learning: How does the native language help or hinder second language word learning in young adults and why? Understanding these interactions will further our understanding of how the new second language words are represented in the brain and how they are connected up to the existing linguistic system. The extent to which involvement of the native language differs as a function of learning methodology will also be tested. These studies will help form the foundation for the development of more effective, evidence-based foreign language teaching practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the proposed studies use event-related potentials (ERPs) to track second language word learning among monolingual college students in a laboratory setting. ERPs measure the electrical activity of the brain on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis, which makes them useful for tracking how rapid word recognition processes unfold over time. The focus is on two specific types of native language words and how their relative importance changes over learning time. Aim 1 considers how newly learned second language words (e.g., lait is the French word for 'milk') interact with the mental representations of neighboring native language words (e.g., laid, last), which overlap in form. Aim 2 considers the connections between the second language word representations (e.g., lait) and their native language translation equivalents (e.g., milk), which overlap in meaning. Both types of words play prominent roles in theoretical models of second language learning and processing; however, their specific roles differ substantially across models. Thus, the field is in need of empirical evidence that will adjudicate between these various models and advance our understanding of how newly learned words are integrated with the native language lexicon. Understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms of second language word learning is a prerequisite to developing evidence-based teaching practices and improving foreign language outcomes among young adult students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scholars have found that the most deadly and longest lasting international disputes often erupt over territory with little or no intrinsic value, and have proposed that such territory is inherently valuable because it is regarded as homeland. As it stands in the literature, this argument presents no systematic evidence to determine ex ante which territory is considered part of the homeland and which is not. This study explores this issue by focusing on the region of the world with the most territorial disputes: the continent of South America. To identity homeland territory, the project collects and digitizes maps from school textbooks and wall maps from all thirteen South American countries from 1875 to the present. With this digitized and geospatial historical (GIS) data, the project can identify which pieces of territory were claimed as homeland by two countries, and which were not. Given the geospatial nature of these data, it can be combined with existing geospatial data on the presence of resources and population patterns to examine whether and how those disputed areas differ from other areas. With these data, the principal investigator can test the prediction that international territorial disputes arise when two countries claim the same territory as homeland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project assesses a key determinant of territorial disputes: the status of a piece of land as homeland by two states. The study identifies homeland territory through collecting and digitalizing maps from school textbooks and wall maps from all thirteen South American countries from 1875 to the present at roughly five-year intervals. The project in addition employs micro-level experiments and surveys to explain why citizens are willing to fight for homeland territory even if it has few or no resources. These experiments and surveys test the extant claim that maps create common knowledge and coordinate citizens' beliefs as to what is homeland territory and who is (and is not) a member of the homeland group, enabling collective action and a common defense. The first survey experiment examines whether priming subjects with a map of their country increases willingness to sacrifice should their country come under threat. This experiment provides micro-level evidence about the role of maps in fostering group identity and willingness to sacrifice, while avoiding the problems of endogeneity and collinearity that have hampered previous research. The second set of surveys examines whether maps taught in school form an enduring mental map of the homeland. This survey asks citizens to draw an outline of their country on a contour map of South America. If the map taught in school has become a stable mental map, the outline should correspond to the map taught during their school years. The surveys embed a micro-level experiment in which respondents are presented with a scenario of a threat against their country. These responses will shed light on whether and why citizens and their leaders are willing to fight for their perceived homeland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has four aims. It gathers data on American society to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors and attributes at both the aggregate and individual levels. It examines the structure and functioning of society in general and the role of various sub-groups. It provides comparisons between the United States and other nations in order to view American society in comparative perspective and to develop generalizable, cross-national models of human society. It makes high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, and others expeditiously and without charge. These aims are accomplished by the regular collection and distribution of the General Social Survey (GSS) and its allied surveys in the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Since 1972, the GSS and ISSP have been efficiently collected, widely distributed, and extensively analyzed by social scientists and others around the world. Over 30,000 research publications have utilized the GSS/ISSP and they have contributed to every field in the social sciences. For example, they have advanced understanding of cohort effects by examining intergenerational transfers and social mobility and studying intergenerational changes in education and knowledge. They have monitored changes in intergroup relations, gender roles, family structure and values, civil liberties and the impact of globalization on national identity. GSS/ISSP data are used in other science fields, such as environmental science, nanotechnology, polar science, computer/information science, and medical science and health. The GSS/ISSP data are also used extensively by government, non-profit organizations, and the mass media.

For more than 5000 years, indigenous groups created coastal landscapes dominated by such artificial hills built from many tons of shellfish  that left a legacy from which to study social and environmental change over millennia. Archaeology can provide new insights about how and why people built these mounded landscapes where shell was used to build architectural features (pyramids, ridges, walkways, plazas), to create mortuary mounds, and to construct elevated villages. A major challenge in the study of shell mounds is that many have been heavily damaged by the rapid development of coastal areas worldwide. This project will develop and implement new and innovative methods for working with ""legacy"" museum collections recovered from sites before they were destroyed. Researchers will generate new insights about the nature of shell mounds, provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in archaeological and museum methods, and contribute to a public outreach program highlighting the significant cultural heritage of these places.

Restoration delays may be created when infrastructure sectors are interdependent and when their operators, potentially lacking knowledge of other systems' conditions and restoration plans, mutually wait for others to act. For interdependent infrastructure recovery, the decisions made by the operators has been overlooked in research, yet it is an important factor in quicker recovery times. To improve recovery of interdependent infrastructure systems, there is a fundamental need to broaden the current perspective to include 1) how individual operators make recovery decisions for their infrastructure systems, and 2) how to improve these decisions. This Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) project compares the effectiveness of a variety of interventions, including information sharing, in reducing restoration times. The project uses interdependent chilled water, information technologies, and electric-power infrastructures at the University of Maryland as an initial case study. To explore the usefulness beyond the case study, a collaboration with a U.S. military installation will evaluate the co-management opportunities, given the models, to improve infrastructure recovery time. Graduate students will also be mentored and trained in these approaches to facilitate a multidisciplinary understanding of linked physical and decision structures to improve infrastructure recovery after a failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce insights into how operators use information to make decisions in the context of interdependent infrastructure. Technically, the research employs novel tools by integrating regulatory analysis, semi-structured interviews, fault tree analysis, agent-based modeling, and serious gaming, to determine how information, and other nudges and regulatory interventions, alter decisions, and ultimately infrastructure recovery processes. The modeling and serious gaming approaches are strongly grounded in an understanding of the physical behavior, observed operator behavior, and governing decision rules and heuristics of operators. Unique to this study is the intersection of interdependent infrastructure modeling and decision science. This interdisciplinary research seeks to develop a new theoretical understanding of interdependent infrastructure informed by operator behavior and to identify practical interventions that improve the co-management of these interdependent systems. Further value is added by comparing computer simulated infrastructure recovery models that produce a ""theoretical"" optimum to an operator-revealed ""practical"" optimum via serious gaming. This presents a significant advance to the interdependent infrastructure field by evaluating the divide between current academic optimization recovery models and actual operator recovery behavior given inducements for better decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particular focus will be given to fields that were mulched with pebbles and cobbles. Fields of this type are particularly abundant, and the technology was apparently well developed in this area. Soil and vegetation characteristics have been documented for other dryland field types in the Southwest, but few comparable studies have been conducted on rock-mulched fields. The study will rectify this knowledge gap and generate data that will allow comparison across the Southwest. Year-to-year changes in the width of growth rings for trees established on fields will be measured to determine how water conserving features may buffer trees from periodic droughts. Relative levels of organic material in soils, which are derived from plant matter, track how water conserving features alter plant productivity over the last few centuries. Together, soil chemistry and tree-rings will help answer questions about how ancient agricultural investments continue to effect contemporary ecosystem productivity, and the role this infrastructure played in supporting the large communities of northern New Mexico from 1300 A.D. until Spanish contact in the 1600s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeology is well positioned to increase our understanding of the factors that led to its privileged place in the modern global economy and, more generally, to improve our ability to model the long-term dynamic relationships between maize agriculture, climate, and socio-economic change. The domestication of corn (or maize) occurred approximately 9,000 years ago in Mexico, but over 5,000 years passed from domestication to the development of the first fully-sedentary agricultural societies. The factors that motivated early Mexican populations to switch from nomadic lifestyles that incorporated maize seasonally to fully-sedentary agricultural economies focusing heavily on the grain staple remain highly contested.  Dr. Andrew Somerville and his research teams in Mexico and the United States will explore the factors that led to the development of incipient agricultural societies in Mexico and interrogate the role that climatic changes may have played in this process. Through close collaborations with Mexican scholars and institutions, the project will strengthen the social infrastructure for international and interdisciplinary research between the United States and Mexico, and the results will have broad significance to those interested in the relationship between agriculture and climatic change, a pressing issue of our time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Somerville and his research teams will analyze the biological collections excavated from a series of dry cave and floodplain sites in the Tehuacan Valley of Puebla, Mexico, one of the first centers of the world to adopt maize farming. The research will use accelerated mass spectrometry dating and stable isotope analysis of human bones to firmly date the timing of when maize became a dominant dietary input in the Tehuacan Valley. In addition, a large sample of ancient and modern faunal bones and plant samples will be analyzed for stable isotope ratios to contextualize the human paleodiet signal, and to make inferences regarding changes in the local environment from the Terminal Pleistocene (~10,000 BC) to the Postclassic Period (~AD 1500). By establishing the timing and context in which economies of food production emerged in highland Mexico, this study tests the notion that maize was a fallback food, initially less desirable than other resources but capable of being intensified during times of scarcity, and that environmental changes encouraged populations to exploit this resource with increasing frequency. In this sense, the research tests the idea that the development of agriculture was an adaptive social response to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientific approaches that involve communities, industry, tribal organizations, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and other stakeholders have been called ""community-engaged research"" or ""stakeholder engagement."" The EngageINFEWS research coordination network (RCN) brings together a diverse group of scientists and non-scientists to develop and document a cohesive set of best practices for community engaged research at the intersection of food, energy, and water systems (FEWS) science. EngageINFEWS aims to advance knowledge of community-engaged research and to help food, energy, and water systems (FEWS) science serve the needs of various stakeholders interested in FEWS.  Results of this RCN will serve to ensure that human communities are equipped with the best possible tools to respond to both chronic and acute social and environmental changes impacting food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community- and stakeholder-engaged research seeks to create a productive and collaborative space for scholarship that involves non-scientists in scientific work. The framework developed by the EngageINFEWS research collaborative network (RCN) considers how principles of collaborative governance may be useful in developing and understanding best practices for working both in and with communities to improve FEWS research. The overarching hypothesis of this RCN is that appropriate approaches to community and stakeholder engagement are determined by the context of specific FEWS projects and differ based on each context. EngageINFEWS is informed by two framing questions: 1) How are community and stakeholder engagement best integrated into interdisciplinary FEWS projects? 2) How can INFEWS teams conduct productive community and stakeholder engagement to support research and educational activities? The overarching goal of the EngageINFEWS RCN is to develop a set of current and best practices across FEWS efforts. This goal is being achieved using a framework co-created by EngageINFEWS network members that is iterative, interdisciplinary, reflexive, and evaluative. This includes creating a long term, sustainable effort which can work with and alongside existing FEWS initiatives to ensure that research is responsive to the needs, concerns, and priorities of the people and institutions that are most affected by FEW system dynamics, vulnerabilities, and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When people move to a new place, they are likely to encounter people who speak with a dialect that differs from their own. In addition, even non-mobile people who live in urban areas are likely to encounter people who have moved to the city from a place with a different dialect. As a result of this geographic mobility, Americans are exposed to substantial variation in regional dialects throughout the lifespan. Some recent research suggests that exposure to different dialects as a result of geographic mobility affects how speech is processed in real time. In particular, greater exposure to dialect variation appears to make people more flexible in their parsing of the speech signal, potentially leading to more successful communication with people who speak unfamiliar dialects. The goal of this project is to understand how this flexibility in processing arises. An investigation of the factors underlying processing flexibility due to geographic mobility will allow for a consideration of how processing dialect variation compares to processing other difficult kinds of speech (such as fast speech, foreign-accented speech, and speech in noise or with an auditory prosthesis such as a cochlear implant), which has substantial implications for understanding the constraints on human flexibility in speech processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine whether the processing flexibility observed among mobile people is limited to the specific dialects to which a listener has been exposed or applies more generally to all unfamiliar dialects. It will also examine how the number of dialects that a person has exposure to and when that exposure occurs (for example, in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood) affects their processing flexibility for both familiar and unfamiliar dialects. Flexibility in speech processing will be examined in a series of speech perception experiments assessing the time course of word recognition and of adaptation to unfamiliar regional dialects. The specificity of the processing mechanism will be assessed by examining speech processing as a function of familiarity with particular regional dialects, such as Northern, Southern, and Mid-Atlantic American English. The effects of the amount and timing of dialect exposure will be assessed by recruiting a large sample of adult participants with a range of residential histories and travel experiences. All of the data collection for the project will be conducted in a language research laboratory that is located within a science museum in central Ohio. Study participants will be recruited from among the museum visitors, leading to direct public engagement with the research.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate ""affection, protection, and correction""  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, entitled the ""Black Family Racial Socialization Project"" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS ""in the moment"", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race ""in the future"". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families."

In particular, the use of solar, wind, and biomass technologies to provide electricity both on and off national grids is escalating worldwide. Energy access and use is not just a technological issue but also a social one, creating opportunities and risks related to connection and production. While there has been significant research on the social effects of carbon-based energy production and use, we know less about the specific ways alternative forms of energy transform peoples' lives, create new opportunities or risk, and affect relationships between individuals and communities. Understanding how alternative forms of energy are perceived and used at the household level, especially by those who may not have access to traditional forms of electrification, is a crucial part of assessing whether and how alternative energy sources can contribute to a more comprehensive and secure portfolio of energy options. Findings from this research will illuminate the ways alternative energy technologies are incorporated into daily life and to what effect, and will inform national and international energy policies that can be targeted toward meeting the needs of the most marginalized members of society. The project also provides training for students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis; broadens participation in the sciences through the training of students and researchers from underrepresented groups; and it improves scientific infrastructure through international scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kristin Phillips of Emory University and Dr. Erin Dean of the New College of Florida will explore the question of whether the benefits and risks associated with the adoption of new energy technologies are socioeconomically differentiated. This research will examine the impact of solar, wind, and biomass energy technologies on the everyday lives of people in the East African nation of Tanzania. Tanzania is a particularly appropriate place for such a study because the state's pursuit of traditional carbon energy development has been coupled with a notable rise in alternative, renewable energy investment by public and private sources. It provides an appropriate laboratory for investigating energy consumption at the household level, where 90% of energy consumption takes place). The researchers have each worked for over a decade in Tanzania, and their in-country research background is geographically diverse, providing the opportunity to consider different approaches to energy use in rural, urban, peri-urban, and island contexts. Because the existing literature tends to overlook the role of women in energy production and consumption, gendered energy labor and use is an important focus of this research. With gender and geographic range in mind, the core of the research for this project will be conducted through critical case studies in domestic settings in three diverse sites. The researchers will use purposive sampling to identify socioeconomically diverse households who are using a range of energy technologies. Using the methods of observation, interviews, and focus groups, they will investigate the socioeconomic dimensions of renewable energy development. The researchers will also conduct interviews with energy experts, advocates, suppliers, policymakers, investors, and technicians in the public and private sector. Findings from the project will make important contributions to scientific discussions about the optimization of energy extraction, theories of inequality, and debates about infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not much is known of how personality, intelligence, and other variables are related, and we do not know how they arise from brain activity.  The overarching, high-risk goal of this NSF-EAGER project is to use neuroscience data to discover the architecture of the mind: can we build a new psychology from knowledge about the brain?  The starting point of this work is the notion that instead of personality, intelligence, positive mood, attention and other current psychological constructs, none of which were derived based on neuroscience data, one might end up with a very different inventory if these psychological variables were derived in a data-driven fashion from neuroimaging data.  This project is exploratory, since there are no extant paths for approaching this issue.  The project will use approaches from the field of causal discovery, essentially asking if we can identify features in neuroimaging data that best explain new, revised psychological variables.  The results will be a proof-of-principle that such an approach could yield new psychological constructs, and if successful will provide an initial direction in which this new field could evolve. The project will also use open science practices throughout its activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project investigates individual differences in psychology and brain function to address a high-risk, high-payoff question: can we use neuroscience to revise psychology?  It will focus on probing two domains of utmost importance to functioning in the real world: personality and intelligence.  There has been success in predicting classical derivations of personality dimensions and intelligence from neuroimaging data, but this approach is inherently limited by the particular psychological constructs used in the first place.  The further step taken here is to optimally combine test results in light of neural predictability, based on causal graphs that are estimated from resting-state fMRI data.  The project will also use a novel, entirely data-driven approach, Causal Feature Learning (CFL), to automatically derive candidate causal variables from the fMRI measurements that may explain the behavioral and psychometric measures used to determine personality and intelligence.  CFL has been used successfully in this fashion to analyze climate data, but it has never been applied to neuroscience. The project intends to make substantial contributions to philosophical and psychological conceptualizations of mental variables and cognitive architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ambiguous populations can appear to fall through the cracks. This creates problems for policy makers who need to protect a nation's sovereignty and also be responsive to economic and humanitarian demands. It can also be an obstacle for social scientists seeking to develop new understandings of the dynamics of changing relationships between people and places.

Current methods used to analyze the general effects of policy changes on relationships among large-scale economic variables, such as total output, inflation, and interest rate are either not able to capture the effects of some extreme events, such as decreasing interest to zero, or are too slow and costly to implement.  This research project will develop new, faster, cheaper, and better methods to analyze the effects of policy changes on large-scale variables in the economy.  The results of this research project will therefore contribute to economic science, and more important, allow for a better understanding of how policy changes or external influences are transmitted throughout the larger economy.  This will allow economist to provide more informed advice to police makers and in so doing, enhance economic growth and improve the living standards of Americans.  The tools developed in this project can also be applied anywhere in the world, thus establishing the U.S. as the global leader in the development of economic analytical tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the Great Recession, models of linear relationship among macro variables used by the Fed and other regulatory agencies were able to capture the most important features of aggregate time series and generate accurate predictions. However, during and after the Great Recession, nonlinearities generated by occasionally-binding constraints such as an effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, have become the norm.  This research project will develop new techniques to construct nonlinear solutions to macroeconomic models in which occasionally-binding constraints play an important role.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop and apply a piecewise-linear solution method that trades off a little of accuracy against computational speed and is scalable to large models used by central banks. The project will also develop a class of flexible models that can be used to assess whether models that impose strong theoretical restrictions are well specified.

For example, city councils and county sheriffs are deciding whether local law enforcement agents check immigration status in the course of regular policing; whether and for how long people are detained in custody for suspected immigration violations; and who enters the federal deportation pipeline. This research examines how local officials wield their authority. Do partisan politics play a role in their decision-making? Do the specific policy preferences of their constituencies? These questions are studied by collecting the first comprehensive dataset on sheriff electoral returns and on the institutional rules that constrain sheriffs, which vary dramatically across the nation and over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work advances several research agendas in political science, law, sociology, criminology, and public policy. First, variation in local immigration enforcement is only recently being documented and explained, and the electoral motivations behind it have yet to be studied at all. Second, the project is relevant to a large academic literature on local politics and representation. For a long time, scholars in this field have argued that there is a limited role for partisan or issue-specific responsiveness in the local electoral context, though recent empirical work has produced new evidence that voters' ideological positions affect municipal governments' fiscal policy decisions. The study is the first of its kind to examine both policy preferences and partisanship in the same framework; and by doing so in a domain that is simultaneously politically charged at the national level and under jurisdictions' immediate control, it will help resolve ongoing debates about the degree and type of responsiveness that prevails in local government. Finally, the project speaks to important normative questions raised by contemporary American federalism, namely how much cross-jurisdictional variation, democratic responsiveness, and partisan politics operate in the enforcement of national laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The choice of residential location is a critical economic decision for households in the United States. Renters search for housing that best meets their needs given their budget. This includes considering affordability, the specifics of the apartment or house as well as desired neighborhood features. However, some renters may face discrimination from landlords and property managers. Housing market discrimination could steer renters into specific neighborhoods and distort the housing search process. This project seeks to understand how possible discrimination affects the search process. The team will conduct an innovative field experiment to see how discrimination affects housing searchers. The team will use the results to develop estimates of the social costs of discrimination in rental housing markets. The project will yield new insights to improve fair housing policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental research on discrimination on housing markets has ignored the role of housing search, making it difficult to disentangle the effect of discrimination behavior on household sorting from the effects of location characteristics. This project integrates a field experiment with an online rental housing platform with a welfare-theoretic framework that takes housing search into account. The field experiment will make use of an innovative use of supercomputing infrastructure to send inquiries to rental housing listings. By examining how landlords and property managers respond to rental inquiries, they will be able to evaluate the impacts of possible discrimination on the choice sets faced by some renters. The welfare-theoretic approach accounts for impacts of discrimination on multiple neighborhood characteristics. It is currently unclear whether discrimination disproportionately hinders the location decisions of households who have preferences for certain attributes of housing or neighborhoods: affordable housing, school quality, safe neighborhoods, or harmful pollution exposures. This project will examine whether certain types of renters are disproportionately affected by discriminatory behavior in the housing market.

Previous research on both of these processes has tried to understand how the communities created through either coalescence or colonialism maintained social cohesion, both within pluralistic communities and between communities in a diverse social landscape. At large scales, one of the primary impacts of both coalescence and colonialism was to draw communities together in a web of economic interdependence, whether on equal footing or in unequal relationships. In many parts of the world, and particularly in North America, coalescence was a key process shaping the social landscape into which European colonists inserted themselves. The organization of economic relationships in these coalescent societies may have served as a pattern for the economic relationships created by the subsequent colonial encounter. However, the relationship between these processes has been understudied. How much did economic organization under European colonialism rely on existing relationships among Native American communities created through coalescence? To what degree did European colonialism reconfigure these existing relationships? Understanding the functioning of these processes is broadly relevant to understanding the history of modern Native American communities in the United States, particularly in the U.S. Southwest, Great Lakes, and Southeastern regions. The results of this research are also applicable more generally to understanding how economic interdependence can foster cooperation between communities and help manage some of the social challenges encountered in highly diverse communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will explore the relationship between pre-colonial coalescence and early colonialism in the Americas, particularly the impact of both processes on economic organization.

Data will be collected from archaeological sites dating to this period throughout the Rio Grande valley of central New Mexico. This data collection is necessary to fill geographic gaps in the existing archaeological literature and therefore give a more complete picture of economic relationships between communities throughout the Rio Grande in New Mexico. The researchers will compile existing data from three lines of evidence to evaluate different scales and types of economic interaction related to the production of ceramics. The researchers will collect new data through petrographic analysis of ceramic tempers and isotopic analysis of lead glaze paints to help fill geographic gaps in the coverage of the existing data. Network analysis will be use used to analyze the data and will both facilitate comparison between the lines of evidence and provide a methodology for understanding complex sets of relationships at larger scales.

Community Geography is a growing subfield that draws from geographical techniques and theories to generate inclusive, mutually beneficial research and action that empowers communities and works toward positive social change.  Unlike traditional research models, community geography emphasizes active partnerships at each stage of the research process, with academics working side by side with policymakers and community groups to address issues with real world relevance such as: local and regional food systems, economic development, access to affordable housing, and environmental or health problems.  Through instruction that emphasizes action-based learning outside the traditional classroom, academic courses in Community Geography provide relevant and meaningful classroom experiences for students.  This award catalyzes a broader, more diverse network of community geographers to gather and further these efforts.  Workshop presentations will also be shared through an online web repository and both academic and non-academic publications.

Although how experience is encoded into memory, how such memory is then consolidated and later retrived have been extensively studied by psychologists and neuroscientists, a critical context in which memory processing taking place has been understudied.  That is the natural rise and fall of the neurochemicals that are known to influence a wide range of brain functions through the sleep and wake cycles.  Here Dr. Sara Mednick of the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and Dr. Michael Silver of the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and their colleagues will investigate how acetylcholine (Ach), a major neuromodulator known to play a critical role in learning and memory, might differentially affect neural processing at the stages of encoding, consolidation, and retrieval.  Rivastigmine a drug for treating Alzheimer's Disease, will be given to human subjects to increase Ach just before training (encoding), just after training (consolidation in the waking state), just before bedtime (sleep-dependent consolidation), and just before testing (retrieval). Brain electrical activity will be monitored using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize how different cortical regions are affected by both natural variations in ACH associated with sleep-wake cycles and by pharmacological treatment. Together, these experiments will provide the critical empirical data to test theories of learning and memory that take into consideration of dynamic changes in neuromodulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acetylcholine has been associated with Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease that affects over 5 million Americans. Better understanding of ACh's role in mechanisms of memory will help treat patients with the disease and also develop tools for enhancing healthy memory as well. A better understanding of neurochemical mechanisms of learning and memory will also help improve educational practice and applied training regimes, and investigations of the role of sleep in this project will help emphasize the importance of sleep in a society that has record low levels of sleep and impaired functioning due to poor sleep habits. Dr. Mednick and Dr. Silver will develop teaching modules and courses on the roles of sleep and acetylcholine and learning and memory as well as a course on sleep methods that will help train students to conduct research in this area. Finally, Dr. Mednick will present public lectures on the health benefits of sleep at local Hispanic-serving public hospitals and will work with the UCR Health Center to promote napping and healthy sleep habits in college students through Nap-Ins and other university-wide events."

Understanding the various aspects of this capacity lies at the core of all linguistic research. What researchers learn about one language provides insight upon comparison with the larger language family and this, in turn, provides further insight on human language. The Linguistic Symposium on the Romance Languages is the largest international meeting of linguistics focused on Romance languages. National Science Foundation funding will provide partial support for the 49th annual meeting (LSRL 49), to be held at the University of Georgia in May, 2019. LSRL has consistently been at the forefront of linguistic research, introducing innovative methods to the study of this particular language family, and enriching our broader understanding of language and linguistics based on studies of these languages. LSRL 49 seeks to bring together linguists working on diverse aspects of Romance languages from a multiplicity of theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and linguistic subfields, thus fostering interaction and the potential for collaboration among researchers investigating different languages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LSRL 49 highlights the importance of documenting lesser-known languages and dialects by including an invited speaker who studies endangered varieties of Romanian. Multilingualism is common among speakers of minority languages. Research is increasingly focusing on how language processing and representation in the multilingual mind. The theme of LSRL49, 'Expanding Horizons in Romance Linguistics', represents the increasingly diverse range of theories and methods used to analyze natural language phenomena. Researchers in linguistics, as in many other disciplines, have taken an interest in Big Data approaches to new and old problems, and LSRL 49 will host a day-long workshop on Corpora and Big Data Analysis for Romance, focusing on the representation of Romance Languages in the context of computational techniques in linguistic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And yet evaluation as a profession has been little studied to date. This project will study of how evaluators shape development policy and practice.  Results from the project will be useful for government and private funding agencies that require evaluations in their grants, the implementing organizations that commission evaluations of their work, and evaluators themselves as they further define their professional standards and practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs qualitative methods to shed light on the processes that shape evaluators' practice on the ground, and the wider consequences of their work.

This fieldwork will reveal how members of this relatively solitary profession create and contest the norms governing their growing field.  The resulting analysis of evaluators as an emerging professional community gives vital institutional context to the larger study of how evaluators engage with other stakeholders as they carry out project evaluations.

Tim,,Dennehy,tdennehy@asu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,08/15/2018,07/31/2020,12981.00,"Under the direction of Dr. Michael E. Smith of Arizona State University, Mr. Timothy Dennehy, will conduct research to address a central anthropological question: how do human societies change as they transition from foraging to agriculture? The origin of agriculture is one of the most heavily researched topics in the study of human prehistory, and much is known about the first people to independently adopt farming in each area of the world. Yet comparatively little is known about the pre-agricultural groups that occupied these same landscapes before farming arose. This hampers understanding of both domestication processes as well as the changes to human society that accompanied them. By analyzing multiple lines of evidence derived from the stone artifacts (lithics) from three sites in the Lowland Maya region of Mesoamerica, this project will contribute greatly to understanding of how human groups transition from a mobile hunting and gathering lifestyle to a more sedentary one focused on food production. This project also works cooperatively with descendant Maya communities in Belize, thus contributing to the training and education of an ethnic group underrepresented in the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Dennehy will examine how tropical forest foragers changed their mobility strategies over time in response to an environment that they themselves were altering through their manipulation of forest resources. The term ""mobility strategy"" here refers to the number of moves made by a group in a given year. On one end of the spectrum, a Residential Mobility Strategy entails many small moves in which the entire group sets up a new camp every few days. On the other end, a Logistical Mobility Strategy entails fewer residential moves but a greater number of small task-oriented (i.e. logistical) moves, wherein specialized groups of foragers undertake long-range trips to bring vital resources back to a central camp. Modern-day tropical forest groups that rely solely on wild resources tend to practice the former strategy; other modern-day groups who more extensively manipulate their environments and cultivate resources tend practice the latter. These two mobility strategies affect the amount of raw material available for stone tool production; in turn, raw material availability impacts several lithic traits, making this project's lithic analysis one of the only ways to indirectly assess mobility strategies. The rockshelters that are the focus of this study contain deposits that date from 8000-900 B.C., and cover the late Paleoindian/Early Archaic transition through the Late Archaic/Middle Preclassic transition, a record whose time-depth and completeness is unparalleled in the Maya world. This record is anchored at one end by the early hunter-gatherer societies who preceded domestication, and on the other by fully agricultural Maya groups; thus, it will provide evidence of the full spectrum of subsistence strategies utilized during the transition from foraging to agriculture. By examining mobility and subsistence throughout this long time period and at three different locations, this study offers a unique spatio-temporal perspective on changing Mesoamerican foraging societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central fovea comprises only 1.7 degrees of the visual field, leaving 99.99% of the visual input to fall on the peripheral retina. Peripheral vision differs from central vision in complex and interesting ways, most importantly due to 'crowding', in which identifying a peripheral stimulus can be substantially impaired by the presence of other, nearby stimuli. Crowding is a critical bottleneck in vision; substantial behavioral evidence demonstrates that crowding greatly limits our ability to perform most real-world visual tasks. The research team will pit a dominant class of models, known as pooling models, against a rich corpus of recent experimental work which has seemed to suggest that visual mechanisms might be more complicated and dynamic than previously thought. This work could enable development of improved materials and tools for those with age-related macular degeneration, in which patients lose central vision. It could also aid design of heads-up displays, user interfaces, and information visualizations such as situation maps for military decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pooling models posit that crowding arises from averaging of features over large local regions, fixed in size, which grow linearly with distance from the point of fixation. The PI has spent the last decade developing the computational and behavioral methodologies that allow one to derive quantitative, testable predictions from a state-of-the-art pooling model. Using these tools, the PI will examine a definitive set of crowding phenomena that have appeared to challenge a unifying account in terms of a pooling mechanism. She will take a three-pronged approach: 1) using modeling and behavioral experiments to examine the assumptions underlying the model challenges; 2) using behavioral experiments to eliminate possible confounds; and 3) designing new experiments to directly test alternative theories. The expected overall impact is to fundamentally advance mechanistic understanding of a key bottleneck in peripheral processing, and thus in visual processing more generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers who study science are also interested in explaining how and why some research is particularly influential, and how scientific research evolves over time. Meeting these goals requires detailed yet scalable measures of scientific influence. Building on recent developments in network science, this project will develop and evaluate a novel measure of scientific influence -- the CD index. The CD index characterizes how scientific works (e.g., published journal articles) alter the use of the knowledge upon which they build.  Some articles build on and therefore consolidate (C) previously published research, whereas other articles depart from and therefore destabilize (D) existing knowledge. This measure offers a new, systematic way of identifying breakthrough scientific discoveries that open up novel fields, and differentiating them from more incremental, but also important, contributions that develop established areas. Results from this project should be useful to individuals involved in research policy development and implementation. For example, university administrators are moving away from a focus on sheer quantity of scientific output toward a greater appreciation for quality and impact. Results from this project will allow administrators to not only identify research that is influential in different (consolidating or destabilizing) ways, but to foster the conditions (e.g., an optimal team composition, or interdisciplinary approaches to scholarship) that promote such output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prominent theories in the economics, philosophy, and sociology of science suggest that scientific influence is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon, with different types of works potentially having different types of effects on the course of science. However, despite growing availability of data and computing power, efforts to incorporate these important theoretical insights into empirical work have been scarce. Most large-scale studies rely on quantitative bibliometrics, using journal impact factors and citation counts to proxy the amount of scientific influence exerted by a given paper or patent. But such proxies are crude and are unable to distinguish between qualitatively different types of influence. Methodologically, the measurement approach developed and evaluated in this project will more closely align empirical and theoretical work on scientific influence. Substantively, the project argues that better, more nuanced measures of scientific influence will help provide clearer and more robust answers to pressing science policy questions. To date, much of the scholarship on scientific influence is quite conflicted. Are women or women dominant teams more likely to produce influential science? Do interdisciplinary efforts facilitate transformative, influential research? The literature is rife with contradictory answers to these important questions. Applying the novel CD index to two entire corpora (JSTOR and the Web of Science)-- as this project will do -- should help resolve them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, imitation can rely on visual observations of an expert's actions, as when a child learns to use a spoon. Imitation with the voice, used when learning to produce the sounds of an unfamiliar language or when learning to sing a song, poses a different problem because one cannot see many of the movements that are involved. Indeed, many people find vocal imitation difficult. However, because the mechanisms underlying this ability are poorly understood, instructors have few resources with which to help such individuals.  The research program focuses on vocal imitation of pitch, a feature that is central to both music and speech production. The hypothesis guiding these experiments is that formation of a mental image of the to-be-achieved goal mediates and stimulates neural associations between auditory and motor networks that allow the actual production to be accurate. By contrast, a less skilled speaker or singer will not have formed as strong auditory-motor associations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three studies will examine participants imitating pitch patterns associated with song or speech. Spoken pitch samples will be based on English, where pitch is mostly used to convey emphasis, and Mandarin, where pitch is associated with word meanings. Participants in this research will include singers and non-singers, as well as individuals who speak Mandarin and those who do not. Planned studies will 1) assess basic cognitive processes (mental imagery, working memory, and perception) that contribute to imitation accuracy; 2) use electromyography to address whether auditory mental images are associated with sub-vocal muscle movements; and 3) explore the role that specific learning experience has on individuals' capacity to imitate. Results from these studies will be used to improve instruction for learning to speak a tone language and for singing.

While the number of women in elected positions has been slowly increasing over time in many countries, there is limited understanding of the unique challenges that often make it more difficult for women to become candidates when compared to men.  To explain why women may be less likely to be selected as candidates, this study focuses on the role played by party gatekeepers in party-controlled candidate nominations. Drawing on insights from interviews with party officials and candidates, the PI examines how barriers in candidate selection are magnified for women through the informal selection criteria used by the party gatekeepers who assess and rank candidates. Although both male and female candidates are subjected to informal selection criteria at local and national levels, only women must visibly demonstrate that they satisfy the financial and mobilizing expectations of party gatekeepers. These gendered expectations entail greater costs for women seeking party nominations because they must demonstrate their wealth and their connections during the candidate selection process in ways that are not demanded from men. This study provides new insights into the organizational impediments to women's inclusion in politics. It shows how biases can arise and be replicated within a party's candidate selection process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study contributes to new knowledge in the study of women in politics in developing countries where democratic institutions remain weak.

These glass ceilings are studied by investigating the factors that affect whether over 1.2 million US doctoral recipients (1977-2015) become professors, and whether they become professors with long lineages of subsequent students who go on to become faculty themselves.  Also studied is whether diverse individuals bring new concepts and new conceptual relations and expand the body of research in new directions.

Historical sources, which are few in number, describe how these communities fought or fled slave raiders, but a key question remains unanswered - how did these strategies transform political, economic, and cultural relations among societies on the edge of the Atlantic world? Archaeology is well-placed to answer this question by examining evidence for changing social relations within and between village communities before, during, and after the rise of the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. Most broadly, this research will cast new light on the historical causes and consequences of a violent social rupture shared by both Africans and the African Diaspora in the Americas. More specifically, it will foster innovative research opportunities for university students and public outreach collaborations with local communities, including the installation of  a museum exhibit at a UNESCO world heritage cultural center in the region. By exploring local responses to global processes over the long-term, this research can also inform forward-looking approaches to US political and economic engagement in rural Africa and other regions on the periphery of the modern world system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gokee and his research team will examine how the Atlantic slave trade impacted social life in a West African ""hatter zone"" - a region where people fought, fled, and/or joined the predatory political economies of neighboring states. Focusing on the Bandafassi region of eastern Senegal, this project will identify the social rules of of inclusion and exclusion that defined who could be enslaved by whom, and under what conditions, over the past several centuries. Researchers will identify these patterns through landscape survey and detailed mapping of past village sites, including riverside locales associated with merchants and militias and highland settlements associated with the people avoiding them. Analyses of the artifacts from these sites, including a microscopic study of pottery, will document how economic processes of production and exchange also shaped the social relations within and between different village communities. The specialized collection and luminescence dating of pottery samples will then reveal how the village societies of Bandafassi did or did not change over time, particularly in response to the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. These methods will generate new data for better modelling how global forces impact local communities in shatter zones past and present, while also providing novel opportunities for public outreach and student education and research in the US and Senegal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impact of trauma may be caused by changes to our genome that alter the way in which genes are expressed and proteins are produced. This project will test the hypothesis that violence experienced by a pregnant woman may produce changes in the genomes of the mother, her child, and her grandchild. This study is a global, interdiscriplinary collaboration that will provide a better understanding of how humans adapt to adversity, and how these adaptations may persist far into the future, long after the adverse conditions have ended. The results of this research will be communicated to the public and scientific community through presentations and publications, student exchanges, and outreach activities to local communities and policymakers. This project will train one postdoctoral assistant and 3-4 undergraduate students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, a unique set of biological samples have been collected and will be assayed for changes to the genome, specifically the addition of DNA methyl groups that can change the expression of a gene. Three generation families have been recruited who have been exposed to violence in different generations; specifically, grandmothers in group 1 were exposed while pregnant, mothers in group 2 were exposed while pregnant, and group 3 are control familes who were not exposed. Biological samples from the mothers and two children (one child was exposed in utero and one child will serve as a control) will be analyzed using cutting-edge methods to assay for DNA methylation changes.

There is preliminary evidence suggesting there is also a gender wage gap in the gig economy. If so, it poses a puzzle to the extent that neither the motherhood penalty nor flexibility preference explanations are readily applicable to the online gig economy. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant research seeks to confirm the existence of the gender wage gap in the online gig economy and explore a potential supply side explanation: that the gap arises due to differences in job application strategies between men and women resulting from differences in expectations. If differences in expectations are responsible for the gap, a possible solution is to provide bidders with accurate information. This project will ascertain whether this is the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gender differences in job application strategies will be studied using proprietary data from a major online labor market platform. Two differences in beliefs will be explored: one arising from a difference in beliefs regarding expected wages or costs and the other arising from a difference in the perceived uncertainty of expected wages or costs. To identify which difference in beliefs is at work, the research will combine results from a large-scale survey of labor market expectations with an information experiment in which expectations will be systematically manipulated. Overall, this project can provide insights on how information policy may reduce or eliminate expectation biases and therefore narrow the gender wage gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines the origins of American leadership in science and innovation in the 20th century, starting with three major questions: 1) How has socioeconomic inequality influenced participation in American science? 2) What are the benefits of public investments in education, reaching from pre-K to the university level? 3) How has social mobility influenced science and innovation in the United States? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major challenge for empirical analyses of science lies in the absence of systematic long-rung data on successful scientists, including their socioeconomic background, education, work histories, inventions, and publications. This research constructs such data for more than 100,000 American scientists who were born between 1817 and 1933. Machine-learning algorithms link each scientist with their census records, patents, and publications. Empirical analyses examine the effects of ethnicity-based restrictions on immigration in the 1920s to investigate the effects of such policies on US science and innovation. Tests for inequality examine the changing influence of a person's socioeconomic background on their success as a scientist.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. James Gross at Stanford University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of emotion regulation in caregiving for cancer patients. Caregivers play a critical role in cancer care and treatment by providing emotional, financial, and medical support on a daily basis. With the growing rise in cancer cases and movement towards cancer care in outpatient and home settings, cancer caregivers' demands only continue to increase. Substantial research suggests that the ways in which caregivers manage the demands of caregiving can profoundly impact their health and patient's health. This project seeks to improve cancer caregiver and patient health by enhancing healthier emotion regulation in caregivers. In doing so, it will use a nationally representative sample, which will increase the generalizability of its findings to a wide range of caregivers and patients. It will also use a well-established and low-cost emotion regulation intervention, Expressive Writing (EW), which will ultimately pave the way for more accessible cancer caregiver interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the important implications of emotion regulation for the health of cancer caregivers and patients, its role in cancer caregiving remains largely unstudied. This project seeks to elucidate the role of emotion regulation in cancer caregiving and to enhance healthy emotion regulation in caregivers to improve caregiver and patient health. It will test three aims: Aim 1 will assess the association between caregiver emotion regulation and caregiver patient health; Aim 2 will assess the impact of an emotion regulation intervention (Expressive Writing; EW) on caregiver and patient health; and Aim 3 determine whether changes in caregiver emotion regulation explain EW's health impacts post-intervention, and 3 months later. These aims will be tested in a nationally representative sample of 500 male and female breast cancer caregivers and their (non-metastatic) patients from three large online panels. The methods used will include online survey measures of emotion regulation, health, and health-relevant covariates, as well as an online 2-group randomized controlled trial (EW vs. matched controlled condition). Findings will inform our understanding of (1) the potentially critical role of emotion regulation in cancer caregiving, whether EW with cancer caregivers improves the health of (2) caregivers and (3) patients, and whether (4) emotion regulation explains why EW may improve health. This research also holds broader insights for social psychology and affective science by informing our understanding of how emotion regulation operates within caregiving contexts and what the most effective ways for changing emotion regulation are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, much scholarship combines these two social structures under the notion of hierarchy, making it difficult to detect how each might be unique. We also do not know how each structure may change over time. This project addresses these gaps by asking how organizational status and authority hierarchies co-evolve. The project investigates whether higher status is associated with exercising authority; whether exercising authority changes a person's relative status; and what the temporal patterns of these changes tell us about the mechanisms linking them. The project studies user actions from over 90,000 workers in 1700 organizations over nearly three years.  These findings help us understand the evolution of inequality at work, with a focus on how authority operates in smaller organizations, where two thirds of net new jobs in the United States are created.  In doing so it will provide policy guidance regarding how smaller workplaces can be organized to reduce social inequality.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes hierarchies in motion by asking how status and authority hierarchies co-evolve in small organizations.  To measure these hierarchies, the project uses uniquely detailed anonymized metadata from five billion user actions taken in a project-and-task-management software system.  These data make it possible to separate the exercise of authority from other actions for 90,000 individuals in 1700 organizations over nearly three years. These data are combined with three months of participant observation at one of these organizations and interviews with managers and employees at it and eight other organizations.  The project provides insights into expectation states theory as well as organizational theory regarding status, authority, hierarchy and their evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, while the FAO estimates that global food production demands will rise 60% by 2050, they also predict that plant genetic resources for crop improvement will shrink by a third. In the face of such endangered food security, the United States, like many countries, must strive to breed, domesticate, and conserve crop genetic resources to help satisfy such increased agricultural demands. The evolutionary relatives and progenitors of domesticated crops (i.e., crop wild relatives) play invaluable roles in plant domestication and diversification, often acting as sources of valuable traits (e.g., pest resistance, increased nutrition, drought tolerance, increased yield) or as potential domesticates themselves. Importantly, crop and crop wild relative diversity have historically and contemporarily been modified by indigenous peoples, who play key roles in crop domestication and diversification through their conscious and unconscious forms of environmental modification. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the data produced by this study will facilitate the growing number of participatory crop breeding, domestication, and conservation projects in the United States and abroad, which depend upon effective cross-communication between indigenous farmers and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John White, under the supervision of Dr. William Balee of Tulane University, will explore the relationship between indigenous practices and perspectives concerning domestication and diversification, and collaborative crop domestication, conservation, and diversification projects. The project will take place among Amazonian Runa, a self-designation of a cultural group in Ecuador known as the Amazonian Quechua or Kichwa. Many indigenous territories (e.g., that of the Runa in the Ecuadorian Amazon) overlap with major global biodiversity hotspots for crop genetic resources. However, despite widespread indigenous involvement in crop domestication and diversification, and the growing number of conservationists and plant breeders working with indigenous peoples in hotspots of crop genetic diversity, indigenous knowledge and practices concerning domestication and diversification remain critically understudied. Specifically, this research consists of one year of ethnographic study composed of daily participant observation and semi-structured interviewing. The data resulting from this investigation will contribute to environmental anthropological theory by illustrating: (1) how indigenous peoples conceptualize and modulate critical biological processes (e.g., domestication and diversification); and (2) how and why the form, function, and value of environmental modifications, like plant domestication and diversification, can change within and across sociocultural contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research on prehistoric trade relations has centered on the analysis of prestige commodities at political and religious centers, demonstrating long-distance economic interaction. But what does it mean when small communities gain access to new goods and how does this affect wider social distinction and authority? How do small-scale social entities contribute to shifting political economies? Archaeology is well positioned to examine these questions because of its emphasis on studying material remains from a chronological perspective. Although this research centers upon one case study, findings will be compared to regional datasets to contextualize site-level findings within a broader political economy. As a collaborative effort between colleagues in the US and Peru, this project has already had significant broader impacts through the employment of rural community members living near the archaeological site of focus as well as the education of undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, the researchers will co-curate a temporary museum exhibit in Peru to display findings to the public. This research also supports US and Peruvian women in science and leadership roles. This research will result in one Ph.D. dissertation as well as multiple conference papers and academic publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravalos and her team will evaluate the material remains of food consumption from every day eating and specialized feasts to identify differences in local authority, economic access, and cultural traditions through the lens of cuisine.

Established during the Early Intermediate Period (1-700 CE) near several intersecting trade routes within the valley, this community was likely engaged in new politico-economic networks that developed during the subsequent Middle Horizon (700-1000 CE). Researchers will examine various datasets to understand changes in cuisine and access across these time periods, including 1) macro- and micro-botanical, 2) faunal, 3) ceramic geochemical and mineralogical, and 4) architectural.

While there have been many studies on political identity and conservation, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the intersection of complex identities and conservation. Some traditional groups in the Americas, for instance, claim both Black and indigenous political identities simultaneously. Such communities often predate the countries in which they now exist, many occupying areas historically assumed to be uninhabitable. Such groups also face land insecurity, while at the same time playing an important role in conservation. Understanding the political identities, territorial claims, and ecological knowledge of these distinct communities has important implications for the creation and management of protected natural areas. The research findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, academic publications, and stakeholder meetings. Results will be communicated through written policy statements and recommendations to government offices, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and local stakeholders. As a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research uses a comparative case study approach, analyzing and comparing the experiences of two Maroon settlements, African-descended peoples who also claim indigenous status. Both communities are located in forested areas of Jamaica, with different levels of environmental protection and state governance. This research has three objectives: 1) identify how Maroons describe and interpret their identity to negotiate claims on territory and protected area management; 2) identify how state officials describe and interpret Maroon identity, claims on territory, and protected area management; and 3) identify ways tensions between diverse stakeholders are resolved. The doctoral student will employ a range of qualitative methods, including: semi-structured key informant interviews; participant observation; and collection and analysis of archival documents (survey reports, environmental management plans, policy papers, and maps). These methods will be complemented by collaboration and affiliation with local communities and environmental non-governmental organizations. Although this research project will focus on Maroons in Jamaica, the findings will provide insights into Afro-Indigeneity and protected area management elsewhere in the Americas, including in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The human capacity to produce and manipulate symbols likely evolved during the Pleistocene and can be seen as a watershed development for the species. While past symbols themselves generally do not preserve into the modern day, the archaeological record can preserve traces of technologies that were used to produce symbolic information. Archaeological deposits dating to the Late Pleistocene produce some of the earliest evidence for these technologies in the form of ochres: iron-rich rocks and earth capable of producing vibrant pigments. Archaeologists are well situated to study this preserved material culture and to place these behaviors within a social and ecological context. While the relationship between the use of symbolic technologies and modern levels of intelligence has been well investigated, the capacity for these early technologies to communicate social information and what that might imply about the social group in which they were used have received relatively limited attention. This project investigates how human populations reacted to changing environmental conditions during the Late Pleistocene through shifting demographics, with archaeological evidence for greater use of symbolic technologies indicating increased population interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of this project involves the examination and comparison of ochre assemblages from three Late Pleistocene archaeological sites located in the Western Cape province of South Africa: Pinnacle Point 5-6, Knysna Eastern Head 1, and Boomplaas Cave. This phase will generate data on how hunter-gatherer groups reacted to changing environmental conditions through population aggregations and dispersals through time. An increased use of symbolic technologies is likely to occur during periods characterized by highly productive environments and population growth. Archaeological deposits dating to these periods are expected to have a relative increased ochre nodule weight, size, count, and evidence of human modifications. Unproductive environments favor lower population densities, resulting in a reduction in symbolic behaviors and the opposite pattern in the ochre assemblages. The second phase of this project will involve the geochemical fingerprinting analysis of the ochres from Pinnacle Point 5-6 via neutron activation analysis. Data generated from this phase will be used to explore changes in territorial range sizes and land use accompanying these expected demographic shifts. Results from the overall study will contribute to the growing body of knowledge concerning population size and structure for early modern humans, the origins of symbolic behaviors, and archaeological approaches to signaling identity. This project has significant broader impacts by engaging with students and the local research community in Cape Town, South Africa through the Human Evolution Research Institute seminar series and training workshops at the University of Cape Town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Thomas,,Graf,mail@thomasgraf.net,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,04/01/2019,03/31/2024,423833.00,"Language technology permeates the daily life of all Americans: from spam filters and spellcheckers to Google translate and digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. But not all language communities benefit equally. In order to perform well, current language technology requires enormous amounts of data, which are not available for smaller languages and dialects such as Navajo or African American Vernacular English. This requirement stands in stark contrast to the learning needs of children, who do not require much to acquire their native language perfectly. Linguists have attributed the ease of language acquisition to innate learning biases--all languages share universal properties, and a learning algorithm that is aware of these universals requires less data. But linguistic models of language universals are couched in terms that make them hard to incorporate into current learning algorithms. Bridging the gap between linguistic theory and language technology requires a mathematically and computationally grounded understanding of universals, both of which are incorporated in this project to inform language science and language technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a computational model of universals in the domain of sentence structure and how it interacts with the shape of words. It adopts a framework that is built on techniques from theoretical computer science, mathematical logic, and abstract algebra. This makes it possible to characterize universals in a manner that is both rigorous and sufficiently flexible to easily accommodate the rich diversity of languages. The researcher will generalize this formal machinery from sounds to words and sentences. The project draws from from the linguistic literature on universals, and feeds it by deriving new universals from the computational analysis. The results  will allow for new machine learning algorithms that incorporate linguistic universals as a strong learning bias. In addition, this award supports the development of an interactive, online learning platform. This resource will enable linguistics students across the country to master the skills they need to study language through a computational lens. Both the research and the education component of this project thus serve the purpose of bridging the gap between language science and language technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines the causes and consequences of women’s exclusion from, and appointment to, three of the most powerful cabinet posts: defense, interior/home affairs, and foreign affairs. These prominent positions policy influence and it is thus vital to explain when, why, and how women access these portfolios, as well as to understand how women’s inclusion shapes policies that are central to the functioning of the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central claim of this project is that women’s presence in political office shapes, and is shaped by, beliefs about the policy responsibilities of the position. Though each of the portfolios studied has distinct responsibilities, they share a focus on security (i.e., protecting the state from domestic and international threats). The first set of hypotheses posits that women access the inner cabinet when the portfolios’ focus expands beyond traditionally masculine policy arenas (such as terrorism and war) to emphasize issues like peacekeeping and human rights. The second set of hypotheses suggests that male and female ministers’ policy priorities are largely explained by the conditions that bring women into (or keep them out of) office, rather than innate gender differences. The third set of hypotheses posits that the appointment of female ministers affects citizens’ beliefs about the aims and prestige of these positions and informs their levels of trust and confidence in the minister, the ministry, and the state. This project thus advances the scientific study of women’s political representation by collecting original data to test these hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project offers the first worldwide study of women in the inner cabinet and a framework for assessing the causes and consequences of women’s access to male-dominated posts in other realms. In doing so, the project develops a new framework for explaining when women access traditionally masculine domains and how their pathways to power affect policy outcomes and citizens’ relationship to the state, we well as compiles a global database on women’s cabinet appointments and policy outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To conserve the existing variety of species, it is important to understand past and present drivers of biodiversity loss. Archaeology and paleoecology provide relevant, long term perspectives on interactions among humans, other organisms, and climate that contribute to extinctions. This project will answer several longstanding questions regarding how a drying climate and the early colonization of Madagascar by humans and associated introduced species may have contributed to past extinctions of large animals on the island. For example, to what extent did humans hunt the now extinct animals? Did introduced animals compete with now-extinct natives, and were introduced animals drought-tolerant relative to natives? Recognizing feedbacks among sources of regional change is a challenge, but this case study of datasets from Madagascar is broadly applicable to the study of past interactions among organisms in the face of aridification. Given the relevance of this research to present environmental concerns and the ongoing development of drought-related policy in arid southwest Madagascar, community and local government outreach is a project priority. This interdisciplinary work involves students and faculty at Malagasy universities, and the students trained through the field component of this research will gain skills applicable to data gathering and natural resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates some of the many ways in which the arrival of humans and introduced species in a novel environment may have contributed to past and ongoing biodiversity loss. The field component of this project focuses on the coast of southwest Madagascar. This region is ideal for studies of environmental changes associated with human activity, because humans and human-introduced animals (e.g. goats, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, and rats) arrived on the island several thousand years ago, and the bones of extinct endemic animals (e.g. pygmy hippos, giant tortoises, elephant birds, and giant lemurs) are abundant along this coastline. Survey and excavation of a series of coastal ponds with traces of past human presence serve to recover the material record of past human activity and biodiversity loss. Radiocarbon dating of bone recovered from fieldwork and museum collections provides the chronological control that is necessary to infer past interactions among humans, other organisms, and environmental change. A series of chemical analyses of radiocarbon-dated bone protein is used to trace aspects of organisms' diets and environments through time. These analyses, coupled with a separately-funded effort to reconstruct the past climate of the region through the chemical analysis of ancient lake sediments, make it possible to examine potential synergies between past human activity and the changing climate that may have driven past extinctions on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While it is evident that primate crania (skulls) have evolved to accommodate larger brain sizes, the mechanistic underpinnings of these modifications are not fully understood. In this project, the investigators will test long-held assumptions about the mechanical role of brain growth on cranial morphology (shape). Using a novel tissue engineering approach to simulate static tensile loads during brain expansion, the osteogenic (bone producing) potential of calvarial, basicranial and mandibular non-sutural bone cells will be examined in a murine model. The research will advance knowledge about the developmental and cellular underpinnings of cranial morphology, provide comparative mammalian data that will inform studies in primate and hominin evolution, and potentially inform clinical research in regenerative medicine. The project will foster interdisciplinary approaches to research and education involving members of under-represented groups in STEM. It will benefit a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students and undergraduates as well as STEM teachers and students, all of whom will participate in presentations and outreach at public and local institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its location at the interface of neural and facial skulls, elevated flexion of the mammalian cranial base is depicted as the mechanical consequence of an increasingly globular brain. However, most experimental evidence indicates that calvarial bony tissues are largely buffered against variation in mechanical stimuli. In contrast, the dura mater is known to be affected by tensile forces during brain expansion and induces growth of overlying sutural bone. Surprisingly, there is little evidence about the extent to which neural forces and pro-osteogenic signaling by the dura affect the development of non-sutural bone in the cranial base and vault. A major goal of this project is to detail site-specific and age-related variation in the osteogenic potential and mechanosensitivity of connective tissues in the growing skull, using the responses of mandibular bone cells as a baseline to evaluate calvarial and basicranial cells. The investigators will assess if bone formation in the cranial vault and base is affected by pro-osteogenic signaling in the underlying dura mater. This research is transformative in its integrative perspective and novel use of tissue engineering methods. Experimental data on how the dura mater modulates bone formation in the skull is key for understanding important questions, including the adaptive nature of cranial vault thickness and circumorbital form in primates. The presence of site-specific variation in craniomandibular mechanosensitivity would also emphasize that variation in intrinsic mechanisms of bone formation should be incorporated into future work on hard-tissue adaptations in diverse mammals, including cranial and limb elements with more marked bony responses. The project outcomes will therefore contribute to both theoretical and analytical advances in biological anthropology, organismal biology, mechanobiology and pathobiology.

The goal of this study is to understand perpetration and victimization of aggression among BCS by testing a social psychologically grounded conceptual model. The research will make important theoretical and empirical contributions by providing a glimpse into the psychological and social processes related to incidence and prevalence of aggression among students.

This remarkable skill has led to the hypothesis that children come to this task with an innate ability to learn certain types of grammatical patterns, namely those manifested in the languages of the world. Through exposure, they learn which patterns are relevant to their language. For example, children learning English initially produce a type of complex questions not grammatical in English, but resembling grammatical German questions. Over time, they learn this pattern is not English and no longer use it. An alternative explanation for these errors is that limited general cognitive capacities, specifically memory, attention, and sentence planning result in productions which only superficially resemble German questions. The goal of the project is to tease apart these possible explanations through controlled experimentation comparing elicited questions and answers by English speaking children and by German speaking children. The two hypotheses predict different error types. If the errors are the result of an innate predisposition, German speaking children should produce some questions resembling English. If the errors are the result of limited cognitive abilities, children learning each language should produce questions which are not consistent with such a predisposition. This research holds the potential to be used as a clinical diagnostic for investigating children's linguistic and cognitive development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research comprises novel experiments designed to test production and comprehension of multiclausal questions.

But to the contrary, moments of inattention to our surroundings may be essential to the formation of memory. This project will test the hypothesis that even when we seem to be sitting still and doing nothing, the mind and brain are continuously switching between two distinct states - one in which we are focused on processing our immediate external environment (an 'online' state), and another during which we ignore our immediate surroundings and turn our attention toward internally generated activity, including thinking of the past and planning for the future (an 'offline' state). This project tests the hypothesis that the early stages of memory processing occur specifically during moments of this offline state, interspersed throughout our day. By developing new methods of measuring these waking states and their function, this work will help to move us toward a more accurate understanding of wakefulness as an oscillation between distinct processing modes that are essential for the formation and retention of long-term memories. As a part of NSF's RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program, this project will also provide high-quality research training for approximately 12 undergraduate students across the course of 3 years, including members of underrepresented minority groups and students from underserved public high schools in South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of human memory have typically treated wakefulness as a homogenous state. But to the contrary, moment-to-moment alternation between online attention to the current environment and offline attention to internally generated thought and imagery may be a fundamental feature of the waking state, occurring even in the absence of a directed cognitive task. Although we all experience such attentional fluctuations throughout the day, the structure and function of these short bouts of offline time remain almost entirely unknown. The objective of the current project is to model this temporal microstructure of wakefulness in human subjects, assessing the functional relevance of fluctuation between online and offline attentional states to memory processing. The central hypothesis is that the early stages of memory consolidation occur specifically during these offline moments interspersed throughout the day. This hypothesis is based in part on the researcher's preliminary data describing features of these proposed states of wakefulness using simultaneous high-density EEG, pupillometry, behavioral, and subjective report measures. To test the hypotheses, the research team will pursue two specific aims. Aim 1 will model the transition between online and offline waking states at seconds-level temporal resolution, using simultaneous high-density EEG, pupillometry, behavioral, and subjective report measures. Aim 2 will assess the contribution of spontaneous offline time to memory consolidation. Together, these studies will test the novel hypothesis that a fast-timescale alternation between online and offline attentional states is essential for memory consolidation to occur. This work thus challenges the traditional view of wakefulness as a unified state, instead describing wake as an oscillation between statistically discriminable cortical states, each with different cognitive functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We anticipate that this work will lead to two main scientific advances. First, this project will develop a new, data-driven model of the alternation between waking states in human subjects. The classification algorithms to be developed will allow future investigators to more easily and objectively detect and measure offline time, while providing a uniquely comprehensive description of the heterogeneous structure of wakefulness. Second, the project will test the relevance of fluctuation between waking states to memory consolidation, resolving a continued uncertainty in the field of memory research regarding the brain state(s) during which consolidation occurs, and the timescale(s) on which it operates. Finally, as a part of NSF's RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program, this project will also strengthen the undergraduate STEM pipeline in an underserved region of the country, providing high-quality research training to approximately 12 undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented minorities and local high school students in South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Perception Action &amp; Cognition Program, the Cognitive Neuroscience Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cryptocurrency-backed initial coin offerings (ICOs) represent a novel form of venture financing that changes the scale and scope of investment as well as encouraging firm structures that maximize hospitable regulatory locations. The outcomes of these processes have important implications for the location of economic growth and wealth formation, particularly within the finance sector.  The project seeks to clarify how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector.  Findings will be disseminated via a variety of publications (academic and more general and using open access publishing), the distribution of  tools, code, and datasets developed for this project for gathering, cleaning and analyzing data via open-source tools and data such as GitHub, and through educational activities such as student training and classroom modules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contribution of this research is to demonstrate how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector. The research will advance theory and understanding within economic geography by looking specifically at financialization and the ways financial institutions and logics exert power in economic systems within these new spaces of finance.  The project has three specific objectives. The first is to determine the geographies of core cryptocurrency functions by asking: what factors contribute to the geographies of different cryptocurrency operations?  How are locations integrated with downstream operations such as ICOs? These questions will be answered using data-scraping and geolocation methods drawn from geospatial science and digital geographies. The second objective is to assesses how cryptocurrencies' uses and networks contribute to value. This will be addressed by using social network analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural nets from computational sociology and computer science to ask: how do networks of cryptocurrencies differ between use types? How does network interaction contribute to value? The third objective focuses on how cryptocurrencies affect financing and entrepreneurial practices within tech-based startups. The investigator will use interviews to gather data to answer: What are the motivations of investors/entrepreneurs in ICOs? and What additional functions are folded into the financing process?  Together these objectives will fundamentally advance basic knowledge in economic geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits and integrates research with education. The collaborative Research Experience for Undergraduates: Past, Present and Human-Environment Dynamics program builds on the success of the Koobi Fora Research and Training Program (KFRTP) and will develop a new framework for integrated training and research in anthropology, archaeology, geology, human biology and ethnoarchaeology. Humans have been interacting with changing environments for thousands of years. For communities that live in remote and resource poor ecosystems, environmental changes present life-threatening challenges. Changes in subsistence practices in the past have allowed humans to adapt to environmental changes. These subsistence changes have also had a dramatic impact on the ecosystems that humans lived in with consequences for the health of communities that live in remote habitats. This project will train 3 cohorts of 8 students from diverse backgrounds (including in service teachers) that will learn a variety of transferable STEM skills to investigate the intersection of human behavior and environmental change. Multiple mentorship contexts will allow students to learn skills in a supportive and collaborative environment. This project will focus on student support and the development of cohorts who will investigate critical components of the interaction of humans and their environments. Each student will: 1) generate new knowledge by designing and conducting an original research project with leading international human biologists and archaeologists, 2) collect and analyze data using state-of-the-art methods, 3) synthesize and present the findings at follow-up workshops and professional development seminars in the U.S., and 4) engage in training on the public understanding of science with outreach coordinators at the American Museum of Natural History (New York). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU project will recruit at least 24 US-undergraduate students nationwide- focusing on students underrepresented in STEM fields. A portion of our students will be involved in a Research Experience for Teachers and use this experience to develop school curricula. Our project will focus the interaction between humans and shifting ecosystem dynamics in the past and present. Specifically, we will investigate the following questions: How do present and past populations react to changing ecological pressures? 2)What was the impact of different subsistence strategies on the ecosystem? 3) How do current communities interact with their environment to meet their water and food needs and what are the impacts of this on nutritional status, hydration status, and health outcomes? 4) How have different populations used shifting patterns of mobility and land use to address these ecological and subsistence challenges? Investigating these questions will form the basis of interdisciplinary training. Trainees will gain a series of widely applicable skills as they gain a holistic perspective on the interface between changing environmental parameters and human adaptations in a tropical arid region. Student research will be incorporated into ongoing public outreach and youth initiative programs at the AMNH. The associated RET component will help develop learning modules for K-12 students that emphasize the time transgressive nature of behavioral and biological adaptations to rapidly changing habitats. This project will help document the health and water issues of ~12,000 community members who are currently under-served and present results to county and national level organizations.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Jennifer Richeson at Yale University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating how attributing discrimination to implicit bias rather than explicit bias affects responses to acts of discrimination. Implicit biases are negative attitudes that can affect behavior outside of conscious awareness and explicit biases are negative attitudes that can affect behavior under full conscious awareness. Implicit bias is argued to be one explanation for the persistence of disparities despite the drop in explicitly negative attitudes toward many societal groups. As a result, a herculean effort has been exerted to raise awareness about implicit bias and claim it as the source of discriminatory outcomes across a variety of contexts. However, preliminary research suggests that attributing discrimination to implicit bias might undermine concerned responses to it. Understanding the consequences of attributing discrimination to implicit bias will be particularly useful for improving interventions designed to addressed societal inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research offers a multi-method approach to the study of the effects of implicit bias attribution on responses to discrimination. The overarching aim is to integrate insights from moral and intergroup psychology to examine the consequences of attributing group-based discrimination to implicit bias rather than to explicit bias and identify whether the consequences differ based on group membership. Specifically, this research (1) compares the effect of implicit bias attribution to explicit bias framing on dominant and subordinate group members' responses to discrimination that has already occurred; (2) extends the examination to vigilance for bias in recorded interactions, that is, as alleged discrimination unfolds, using eye-tracking; and (3) tests a potential intervention for the implicit bias attribution effect. The results of this research will add to our understanding of how people incorporate information about social psychological phenomena into the situations they encounter every day. In addition, the findings highlight the imperative to examine the way scientific findings are understood by the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project compares the trajectories of two mega-cities that in began in the 1980s and early 1990s from roughly equivalent situations, including a relatively high level of local governance and commitment to delivery of urban public goods such as housing, sanitation, and public transportation.  Yet despite similar goals and strategies, while state interventions have reduced urban inequalities in one of these cities, they have reproduced these inequalities in the other one.  This project promises to generate new insights into the relationship between states, democracy, and urban inequalities.  Findings will be useful for urban policymaking in the midst of social change.  They will inform understanding of how cities can coordinate politics and institutional change to deliver public goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use multiple methods to compare public goods provision in São Paulo, Brazil and Johannesburg, South Africa.  The methods are: a) field-based participant observation and interviews with key public and private actors; b) archival research of legislation, newspapers, trade publications, and internal government and NGO documents; and c) spatial analysis of 25 years of quantitative data on housing, sanitation and transportation.  The research design and comparative-historical methods of analysis make it possible to disaggregate changes in interactions between social coalitions and state institutions over time, and to specify the mechanisms of these changes.

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This REU Site Program, ""Spatial Models and Electoral Districting"", supported by the University of Puget Sound and the University of Washington Tacoma, produces cutting-edge research and the next generation of experts on the socially and politically urgent issue of electoral districting. Bringing together work in geography, mathematics, data science, and computer science, the REU Site both advances scientific knowledge and furthers the national interest. The REU Site produces unique, timely, and important research on redistricting in the years immediately prior to decennial redistricting. It emphasizes the participation of students from traditionally underrepresented gender, economic, and racial identities within the academy and STEM fields. This REU engages these students through research-driven approaches to civic participation and produces both an interdisciplinary research agenda and policy-relevant results. Further, through the support of students less likely to otherwise participate in research opportunities, the REU's impact is not simply on those who participate, but also on the disciplines and career paths the participants diversify and improve throughout their careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By taking a synergistic approach to the computational, geographic, and political aspects of electoral redistricting, the REU Site encourages unique and new ideas to emerge at the center of an important, timely societal question. Each summer the program supports two research teams, each consisting of two research mentors and six students over an eight week program. Training will include GIS, the python programming language, and other technical skills. During the first three weeks, REU participants will interact with invited experts from political science and public policy, among other fields, to help ground their projects in existing scholarship and public concerns. The REU Site's primary goals are to: (1)  provide a high-quality research experience to non-traditional REU students, specifically focusing on underrepresented gender, economic, and racial identities as well as students from smaller colleges with fewer research opportunities; (2) train students and researchers in interdisciplinary approaches with broad real-world implications, preparing students for potential graduate research or careers in the burgeoning fields surrounding data science and geospatial technologies; (3) help researchers gain experience in producing collaborative, pertinent research with undergraduate students.

The SPARK Society has been created to overcome two of the root causes of this underrepresentation: an insufficient pipeline and a lack of role models. Members of these underrepresented groups who do enter the field also may have reduced access to effective mentorship. The result is that graduate students and junior faculty who are African-American, Latinx, or Native American may be less successful moving through the complex and often obscure academic track. Through satellite conference panels and workshops, online forums, social media outreach, and a state-of-the-art online presence, the SPARK Society will facilitate mentorship and support of scholars from these underrepresented groups. Society goals will be achieved (1) by fostering an environment that welcomes and nurtures junior African-American, Latinx, and Native American scholars, (2) by contributing to the professional development of these scholars throughout their career, (3) by creating a network that will provide contacts and connections to other scholars from underrepresented groups in psychological science, and (4) by implementing an innovative model of mentorship, whereby faculty members of the society will invite and mentor undergraduate students who attend institutions located in the vicinity of conference locations. This novel approach to mentorship brings mentorship to students, instead of students' having to identify mentorship needs independently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SPARK Society will establish panel discussions, in-person mentoring sessions, and group networking meetings in the context of existing conferences for psychological scientists.

This research will explore the impacts of drought in order to improve management efforts to mitigate conifer die-back and wildfire risk. Since 2010, over 52 million hectares of trees have died in California's forests due to climate change, drought, and drought-induced disturbances such as wildfire. Forest loss and wildfire trends have important implications for the health, safety, and well-being of communities in both urban and rural areas throughout the American West. The effects of how competition, species, and habitat interact geographically to influence tree responses to drought will be studied across six conifer species. This research will benefit society by providing valuable input data for potential fire risk modeling. The project will also mentor young scientists at an undergraduate institution. It will provide knowledge to land managers and regional tribes through public and educational outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use the recent drought as a natural experiment to investigate conifer responses within diverse species' biogeographic distributions.

Even though about 13 percent of public school students in the US are in SE and large amounts of money is spent on it, very little is known about the long-term impact of SE.  This research project fills the gap.  In 2005, the Texas legislature introduced a district level SE enrollment cap of 8.5% at a time when the average district had SE enrolment rate was 13%.  To be compliant, school districts sharply reduced SE enrollment. The proposed research will use this policy change to identify the short- and long-term effects of participation in SE.  The results of this research will shed light on the benefits and costs of SE as well as provide policy inputs into the design and implementation of SE programs.  The results of this research project will therefore improve the development of US human capital, and as a result, increase economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will use an exogenous change in policy to identify the causal impact of SE on short-term and long-term student outcomes. The study will exploit a 2005 policy change that mandated SE enrolment in Texas school districts to not exceed 8.5% at a time when the average SE enrolment rate was 13%. This resulted in several districts sharply cutting back SE enrolment.   Utilizing across district variation in distance from this enrolment cap and students' years of policy exposure, the PIs will construct an instrument that captures the strength of policy pressure to reduce SE enrollment. The IV estimates reflect a local average treatment effect (LATE) for students whose diagnosis could be altered by school district change, thus providing the causal impact for students on the margin of SE placement. The results of this research project will provide guidance on policies to improve special education and human capital formation in the US.  In addition to the estimates, the research project will create a large data set on SE that will be used as other researchers will use it to study the effects of special education in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process undergoes important development during early childhood, and is shaped by family socioeconomic status (SES). WM, in turn, shapes children's progress in school, and has been shown to mediate the association between SES and academic achievement. Traditional laboratory assessments may fail to capture the complexity of WM behavior and conditions under which WM operates most optimally; thereby, limiting opportunity for evidence-based recommendations for education. In order to address this gap in the literature, the research team will measure the impact of SES on WM development in children 3.5 to 6 years old using parallel computerized and naturalistic play-based settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use a rule-based WM task, where children are instructed to match a door to a house (or a beak to a bird) based on either one (e.g, color) or two (e.g. shape and color) visual feature dimensions. In daily life, WM does not function in isolation, but is paired with motivation to succeed.  Thus, in order to increase the ecological and construct validity of WM assessment in both computerized and play-based testing settings, researchers included three conditions designed to assess how engaging motivational mechanisms impacts WM performance. The Choice condition is identical to the Standard condition, but children choose the houses that they want to play with; the Reward condition is identical to the Standard except the children earn a sticker after correct trials. The Reward+Choice condition combines the Reward and Choice manipulations. A central component of the study involves determining whether the impact of SES on WM is constant across computerized and play-based settings, or whether the impact diminishes as WM tasks increase in ecological and construct validity.  To address this issue, the researchers will collect data on experiences in children's lives that may mirror the computerized and play-based testing environments. SES impact on WM performance in computerized and standard assessments may be mediated by formal instruction opportunities in and outside the home (art or music classes) as well as digital device use and skill. The researchers will also collect data on experiences in children's lives that may support WM development but be independent of SES. For example, individual differences in pretend play engagement may be related to WM performance in play-based settings, independent of SES. These predictions will be tested using structural equation modeling. Findings will provide novel insights regarding optimal WM performance in young children across various levels of SES. Findings will also have implications for shaping early childhood curricula in ways that will benefit children across various levels of SES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Andrea,,Torvinen,atorvine@asu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,07/15/2018,06/30/2020,21254.00,"Throughout history, human societies have cycled through periods of coalescence and fragmentation and processes of social identification play an important role in their long-term success. When people identify strongly with others in their community, the potential for collective action is high and the community as a whole tends to thrive. However, the archaeological record illustrates the development and decline of villages, states, and empires over time and across space. Widespread and long-lasting collective action, therefore, occurs most frequently when groups of individuals (1) recognize membership in the same social categories (e.g., nationality or religious affiliation) and (2) engage in repeated, face-to-face interactions (e.g., neighbors or colleagues). When one of these modes of social identification is weak or breaks down, the potential for collective action decreases and the community is at risk for failure. While this theoretical framework was developed for regional-scale, comparative research involving cases of modern nation-states and social movements, this project adapts it into a methodology that can be applied at the community scale within a frontier context. Traditional frontier studies treat these peripheral regions as whole entities and focus on how they engage with or in reaction to processes occurring within the core, rather than examining the agency frontier inhabitants have in shaping, maintaining, and altering their social identities. By examining how people expressed their identity through material culture, this project will shed new light on how collective identities form and change in frontier regions. Furthermore, this project involves long-term collaboration among American and Mexican researchers working in the northern frontier of Mesoamerica and will result in rapid advances in the characterization of social dynamics within northern frontier communities and across the region as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine the interplay of the two modes of identification to establish the potential for collective action through time and across spatial scales within the Epiclassic (600-900 CE) site of La Quemada, Zacatecas, Mexico. The material culture of the northern frontier region suggests both the existence of shared social categories and direct interaction among frontier communities, yet these communities persisted for varying lengths of time. La Quemada, for example, was abandoned around 900 CE, while other sites persisted. It is hypothesized that either a change in how La Quemada residents identified with one another weakened its collective identity, or the conditions for sustained collective action never existed at the site scale. Ceramic data collected via chronological, stylistic, and petrographic analysis will be used to assess each mode of social identification: (1) shared styles of ceramic decoration are assumed to represent similar social categories; and (2) the raw materials used to produce pottery are interpreted as evidence of direct interaction. The characterization of social identification within La Quemada and how changes in identification may have impacted the potential for collective action will provide a model that can continue to be tested in the future through comparison with more persistent communities in the northern frontier and in other frontier settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an interdisciplinary, two-day, public conference that addresses an important scientific question: How we determine that something is unknowable rather than merely not yet known? Experts across a range of academic disciplines (including mathematics, cosmology, biology, medicine, economics, psychology, history, and philosophy) will discuss the criteria used to determine that a deep question cannot be answered and whether these criteria differ across fields. The conference is to occur in March 2019 at the campus of The New School for Social Research in New York City. The conference is likely to attract a large audience, from 300 to 400 people, that will include members of the public, the media, and policy makers as well as students and academics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions that are to be addressed by conference participants are fundamental and of perennial importance; they require revisiting from time to time. A similar conference on this specific topic occurred at Columbia University in October 2000; it was a workshop on the known, the unknown, and the unknowable; and it was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. A generation has passed, and it is both timely and important to address these questions again. It is likely that the conference will attract a large and broad audience, and that it will foster dialogue within and beyond the academy and serve to enhance public understanding of important social, intellectual, and political issues. Papers from the conference will constitute a special issue of Social Research: An International Quarterly. The conference proceedings will have a good chance of inspiring and affecting the discussion of the criteria that define the limits of knowledge, perhaps even leading to changes in those criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multitasking is a complex cognitive process that is prevalent in everyday life, from texting while walking to driving while reading a street sign. It is well established that during multitasking, both tasks are associated with performance declines, as compared to when the tasks are independently performed. Fortunately, through practice and learning, multitasking costs may be reduced. Yet, how the brain enables us to enhance multitasking performance remains elusive. This project investigates these questions by studying whether training can improve multitasking performance, as well as the changes in brain responses that accompany such improvement. It will also use interventions that impact brain activity and that may themselves produce multitasking improvement. The importance of the current project is in advancing the limited scientific knowledge in this domain, and in enabling multiple activities and outcomes that will be relevant to society more broadly. Apart from the scientific work, this project will offer several volunteer opportunities for high school and college students. For all these positions, women, persons with disabilities and minorities in STEM education will be highly encouraged to apply. Second, the knowledge generated by this research will be disseminated to the public through open-source publications, public lectures, and media outlets. These findings will enhance our understanding of multitasking ability, and developing therapeutics to target populations who suffer from this cognitive decline or learning disorders. <br/>    <br/>The overall aim of this project is to address the hypothesis that regions within prefrontal cortex rely on theta band (4-7 Hz) oscillations to enhance and optimize multitasking ability. To achieve this, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) will be applied in the theta band above prefrontal cortex while participants are engaged in multitasking: visual discrimination with a concurrent visuomotor tracking task. Transcranial stimulation will be applied on three consecutive days while participants are engaged in multitasking. Participants will be assessed one day and one month after tACS to assess whether theta stimulation above the prefrontal cortex facilitates learned improvements in multitasking. Additionally, electroencephalography (EEG) data will be used to assess changes in oscillatory activity that supports learned multitasking improvements. It is hypothesized that tACS stimulations that impact theta oscillations will be particularly effective in improving multitasking performance, potentially impacting frontal theta EEG oscillatory power. To evaluate whether these learned multitasking improvements arise from alterations within the prefrontal cortex, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data will be collected from each participant and used to form individualized models of the tACS-induced electric fields in the brain. It is hypothesized that due to anatomical differences that impede tACS current flow to the brain, participants with greater modeled electric fields in the medial prefrontal cortex will exhibit the greatest increases in prefrontal theta oscillations and the largest improvements in multitasking ability. The proposed research will provide a direct assessment of mechanisms by which brain networks give rise to learned improvements in multitasking ability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers have hypothesized that early modern human consumption of marine protein (e.g., shellfish) aided the rapid dispersal of hominins from Africa, and that early stone tools enabled greater access to animal protein and fat that fueled the energetic demands of brain growth and cognition. Testing hypotheses about the importance of marine protein for early human population movements and biological adaptations has been difficult given the dearth of suitable model primate systems. However, this project has identified one such model system, a unique population of macaques that use stones to extract and eat shellfish, with individual monkeys differing in tool-use abilities. The investigators will measure relationships among shellfish consumption, protein levels in individual monkeys, and tool use, to determine how variation in technical competence with stone tools may influence protein intake. The project has broader impacts at the local, national, and international levels, including training and professional development for underrepresented students, international research collaborations with Chulalongkorn University, educational outreach in K-12 settings, and the dissemination of research findings beyond academia through various media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will begin to explore the fitness consequences of individual variation in stone tool use and shellfish exploitation. The investigators will use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to measure the contribution of protein from shellfish consumption to the hair protein of individual monkeys within a stone-tool using population of long-tailed macaques in Koram Island, Thailand, and quantify the benefit of tool use to protein assimilation. These objectives will be achieved by 1) measuring the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of macaque hair and all food sources, and 2) combining isotopic data with behavioral data on foraging (as informative priors) in a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportional contributions of protein sources to hair as a direct function of stone tool use and technical proficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to fill this gap through bioarchaeological and genetic studies of these Neolithic communities. This study marks a new approach to exploring archaeological questions through a robust integration of genetics, archaeology, and osteology. The project will support student training, international research collaborations, and public science outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will investigate human skeletal remains to explore the creation, maintenance, and mobility of Neolithic communities in central Anatolia. Specifically, data on ancient DNA (aDNA) and dental morphology and metrics will be integrated from multiple archaeological sites that span the Epipaleolithic (~12,500 to 11,500 cal BCE) to the late Neolithic (5550 cal BCE). These localities cover a large span of time within a defined geographic area, contain excellent contextual information, and have produced a large set of human remains that are amenable to dental and genetic analyses. These biological data will then be used to test regional questions and hypotheses about population development and movement as well as social structure to understand this process of ""Neolithization.""  This study moves the emphasis from grand-scale analyses to regional questions about the Neolithic, to include population interaction, social structure, and regional development.

As iconicity is prevalent in sign languages, one might think that deaf children would have an advantage in learning new iconic signs. However, this does not appear to be the case, at least for some iconic signs. For example, depicting constructions (DCs) in sign language are iconic, yet children acquire these signs at a prolonged timescale relative to other signs. This research asks why, and thus has implications for early intervention in deaf children with language delays. There is a great need for sign language tests to assess children's sign language knowledge, and this project can inform the development of these tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depicting constructions (DCs) have non-discrete, gradient properties, which may be difficult for children to understand. One hypothesis is that young learners are biased to interpret all movements within a linguistic system as categorical, resulting in difficulty in interpreting gradient mappings in sign, which leads to errors in DCs. Children might not apply this same linguistic bias to non-linguistic stimuli (such as gesture, which has no linguistic categories) and, and if so, should be able to interpret gradience within gesture. The alternative hypothesis is that young learners can interpret gradient mappings in both sign and gesture, but do not know the phonological constraints on forming DCs and thus overuse gradience, which leads to errors in DCs. This research has three aims: (1) examine the types of errors native signing children form when producing DCs; (2) understand how these learners interpret iconic, gradient movements within linguistic (sign) and non-linguistic domains (e.g., gesture); and (3) understand how specific language experiences shape children's assumptions about gesture and sign by testing children exposed to sign language and those not exposed to sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project considers two of the ecologically hardiest of cereal crops: broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Today, these two minor cereals are consumed less frequently, thereby attracting little scientific attention, however they were once among the most expansive food crops in geographical terms, with a center of origin in northern China and spreading to India and Europe in prehistory. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we seek answers to two questions: (1) when did millet first become a staple food for human consumption? and (2)  when and how did millet cultivation expand from its place of origin in north China to Central and South Asia? The ecological merits of the two millets under investigation make them particularly important in the context of food security in modern systems in their capacity to grow in marginal areas. Understanding the history of these two drought hardy species can also raise awareness of their capacity for future utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to test hypotheses about the consumption and spread of millet, Dr Liu and the research team will undertake three types of analyses: (1) bulk carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of archaeological animal bone collagen and plant materials; (2) compound specific carbon isotope analyses of archaeological human and animal bone collagen; and (3) direct radiocarbon measurements of archaeological millet grains from across Central and South Asia. These data are built on significant improvements in sample preparation and methodological refinements in the recent decade. In taking a multidisciplinary approach, this project provides insight into not only the two specific crops, but the communities who utilize them. Why were these crops chosen as primary targets of food production? Why are communities situated in a recurrent landscape (foothills / edges of the mountains) seemingly always interested in these plants? Why do people seemingly consume a lot of crops but not a lot of meat? Early discussions on East-West contacts have primarily focused on the inter-continental exchange of material goods. This project will however shift the focus to emphasize the role played by the primary agents of agricultural production, the ordinary farming communities themselves, who do not always own much material goods, but pioneered the globalization process in the ancient world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Ken,A,Paller,kap@northwestern.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,08/31/2021,335730.00,"Sleep is crucial to the body's ability to function but scientists have yet to uncover all the reasons for why we sleep. Recent evidence shows that sleep contributes to memory, although how that happens is not yet well understood. This project explores the idea that the ability to remember depends on sleep-based changes in how memories are stored. The investigators have the special opportunity to obtain recordings of brain activity from sensors placed inside the human brain. In some patients with frequent epileptic seizures, when pharmacological treatments are ineffective, a surgical treatment can greatly enhance quality-of-life. Sensors placed in selected brain locations can isolate the source of abnormal activity, after which this brain tissue can be removed. These patients are usually willing and able to help the investigators understand what happens during sleep to preserve memories. The investigators will explore how the reactivation of new memories during sleep improves the ability to remember the information. This type of memory processing during sleep could constitute an essential ingredient for learning. Results from this project may have implications for educational advances and for approaches to improving memory across the lifespan. The investigator plans activities to increase public understanding of science and to bolster recognition of the vital benefits of sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key hypothesis in the field is that a brain region known as the hippocampus functions during sleep to help consolidate memories. This can entail linking anatomically disparate components of a memory, gradually integrating new knowledge with prior knowledge, securing memory storage, and potentially transforming what is stored. The investigators will analyze recordings of brain activity from functional brain tissue to determine how memory storage is altered when audio input during sleep promotes memory reactivation. Brain oscillations identified previously (so-called slow oscillations, sleep spindles, and hippocampal ripples), and their precise temporal interrelationships, are hypothesized to be critical. Analyses of these signals obtained during memory reactivation are thus positioned to provide new knowledge about neural mechanisms of sleep-based memory improvement, thus advancing fundamental understanding of what allows a small subset of the massive number of memories people acquire each day to survive for the long term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this, researchers change factors affecting a task in an experiment and observe responses. One way to learn from such an experiment is to build and test a computational model of stimulus-response relationships. However, the level of detail with which a model describes a task requires as much detail in supporting data. As observations from experiments are often expensive (e.g., child subject), this is a rather significant barrier. The method of optimal experiments can be a solution. It can optimize the selection of stimuli to maximize inference from responses. Nonetheless, the difficulty in applying the method to each new experiment has been a stumbling block. This project proposes to lay the foundation for a general framework for optimal experiments. The goal is to make it applicable to a wide range of modeling problems in cognitive science. This will help cognitive scientists to develop quantitative accounts of cognitive tasks effectively. Further, the method has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery broadly in social and behavioral research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conducting cognitive science experiments guided by optimal interaction with subjects toward a clear, quantified inference goal is a powerful idea. Such a method is particularly enticing for behavioral experiments in which the amount of noise in response is so great as to require many repeated measurements. Despite its groundbreaking potential for cognitive modeling research, the method of optimal experimentation is out of reach for most researchers in the field. The formidable task of implementing it for each unique experimental paradigm has been an obstacle to the realization of the methodology's promising power. The project focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of optimal experiments in arbitrary cognitive modeling contexts. The proposed research will define the need for the methodology in the field clearly, identify suitable computational strategies, and test alternative algorithms in simulation studies. The performance of algorithms under consideration will be evaluated on a testbed of modeling paradigms whose successful treatment would transfer to a wide range of similar problems. The project aims to create a tangible blueprint for a general-purpose methodology for optimal experimentation in computational cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the researchers will examine behavioral, demographic and genetic factors that may contribute to the ability of an individual to establish successful social relationships. Focusing on a non-human primate model in which both father and mother provide care to their young, the researchers will study interactions between reproducing pair-bonded adults and solitary non-reproducing ones. This research will contribute to a better understanding of social relationships, including mating and parenting relationships, in pair-living, monogamous groups. The team will train nine undergraduate students, two Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral researcher from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. International collaborations with researchers in Argentina will be strengthened, and the investigators will expand efforts to foster the development of the biological anthropology discipline in Latin America. At the national level, outreach activities will include working with programs involving underrepresented minority high-school and undergraduate students in research (STARS program at the Yale Peabody Museum) and creating a public series of presentations based on their work for topics regularly covered in animal behavior and biological anthropology courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project occurs within the Owl Monkey Project of Argentina, an international research program to advance knowledge and theory about the evolution of pair-bonding, monogamy, and paternal care.

The investigators will study solitary individuals who have left their natal group but have not yet pair-bonded, as well as pair-bonded adults. The solitary individuals need to enter a group to reproduce, which generates intense competition between solitary and pair-bonded adults. Data collected as part of this project will be used to evaluate how competition between solitary floaters and pair-bonded adults influences infant development and survival, natal dispersal patterns, pair-bond formation and stability, and mating patterns. In addition, because this primate species shows very little physical difference between males and females, but intense competition in both sexes, these data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of sex-specific morphologies and behaviors. The project will therefore make theoretical and empirical contributions to a number of concepts that are central to biological anthropology and evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teams constitute the social engines that drive new developments with an increasing dominance in science and technology. Nevertheless, little is known about the process through which teams succeed and fail as the vast majority of studies are based on observation and analysis of successful teams alone. For example, most team research is restricted to teams that successfully formed in the first place, resulting in a joint publication or patent. In reality, most teams fail, sometimes in a spectacular manner. This fact suggests that our current understanding of teams suffers from systematic selection bias where failed teams have largely been ignored because the data that trace them are much less abundant. Prior investigations have documented the career advantages teams confer on their members, but not how they influence scientific discovery and technological invention. Here by analyzing teams that fail alongside their successful counterparts across many domains and outcome metrics, this project will uncover empirically-grounded insights regarding why, how, and when teams fail. Without analyzing the many ways in which teams fail, researchers remain unable to identify robust factors associated with success. This project examines team success and failure across a broad array of science and technology-related contexts, ranging from biological, social and natural science and scholarship to technology, software, and entrepreneurship. Teams can be large or small, more or less structurally integrated, and involve distinct combinations of member roles or mixtures of prior experience. The project involves a two-stage research program to understand how successful teams of different sizes and shapes ""think differently"" and can be designed to accelerate scientific and technological development. First, the project evaluates success and failure outcomes for than 100 million R&amp;D teams over 100 years in terms of team size, network structure, role composition and experience. Second, insights developed from this investigation will enable the launch of large-scale online team experiments to isolate the causal mechanisms driving these effects. These experiments will bring certainty about critical team mechanisms and facilitate recommendations for policy that can be used to design teams optimized for specific purposes in advancing science and technology. Overall, this research promises to dramatically improve our ability to trace, assess, predict, nurture and design high-impact and highly disruptive teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, our project first involves (1) massive data cleaning and linkage between data on teams from a variety of domains in science, invention, and entrepreneurship. Then (2) team success and failure is measured at many stages, including the failure to secure funding, publish papers and prosecute patents, inject the frontier with novelty, attract scientific and technical attention, remain robust to replication, and achieve persistent influence. Next, the research (3) analyzes the impact of team size and complexity on success and failure by examining the size, complexity, role structure and diversity of experiences within teams. The project uses insights from this investigation to (4) deploy online team experiments to causally identify the influence of team characteristics on success and failure outcomes. Finally, (5) optimal teams are recommended, as also optimal team alterations or adjustments based on desired science and technology outcomes. Results from this work could influence global science and technology policy by increasing appreciation for the benefits of distinct types of teams -- small and large, simple and complex, diverse and similar -- relative to the science and technology outcomes they support, including disruption and collective advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ancient monsoon and its effect on African ecosystems is thought to be responsible for a number of significant turning points in the evolution of early humans. Nevertheless, there is a lack of high-resolution and long-term information about the amount of rain that fell over East Africa during the interval between 4.0 and 1.0 million years ago. This has obscured understanding of how climate changes may have influenced early human anatomy, the development of stone tools, and dietary habits. To address this problem, the prehistoric rainfall of northwest Kenya will be reconstructed by using geological fieldwork and laboratory analyses of ancient soils.  These ancient soils directly encase important fossils and archaeological sites that document the oldest stone tools in the world that are currently known, in addition to the evolutionary history of such species as Homo erectus and Homo habilis.  Further objectives of the project are to train Kenyan professionals in laboratory research methods and develop a mobile teaching project through the Rutgers Geology Museum that provides schools in the United States and Kenya with hands-on opportunities for learning about fossils, archaeology, and geology.The research project will provide the scientific community with an advanced understanding of Earth's ancient climate and methods of reconstruction, highlight the importance of Kenya for interpreting the human past, and strengthen the collaborations between the National Museums of Kenya and the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of Dr. Lepre concentrates on the longstanding questions: Why was there such a diversity of human evolutionary events during the timeframe of 4.0-1.0 million years ago, and how did the environment contribute to these events?  He will address these questions by analyzing the iron-bearing minerals preserved in ancient soils.  Such minerals, like hematite and goethite, are formed under certain temperature conditions and specific quantities of yearly rainfall.  Through assessing the ratio of hematite to goethite in ancient soils, past environmental changes due to climate can be reconstructed and compared with events of human evolution. Dr. Lepre's laboratory at Rutgers University is equipped with a spectrophotometer that can detect hematite and goethite in soil samples through measuring the diffuse reflectance of light.  As these minerals contain iron, additional measurements of the magnetic properties of the samples will help elucidate the environmental conditions under which the ancient soils formed.  Geologic fieldwork will be conducted at the Lake Turkana Basin, a geographically remote but world-renowned fossil and archaeological locality in northwest Kenya.

Farming methods that focus on supporting biodiversity to produce essential ecosystem services may play an important role in addressing this challenge while lessening the harmful effects of intensive farming methods that rely heavily on non-renewable inputs.  The investigators will focus their research on lettuce farmers who vary in their use of practices that support biodiversity along the central coast of California, one of the nation's most productive agricultural regions.  The researchers will employ in-depth interviews and focus groups with these farmers to discover how and why they do or do not adopt diversification practices.  Ecological studies of their farms will assess bird and soil microbial biodiversity and will quantify key ecosystem services provided by these organisms including the maintenance of soil fertility, enhancement of water conservation, and reduction of the spread of foodborne pathogens.  A range of socioeconomic methods including a quantitative survey and a farm-level cost-and-return study will examine how biodiversity and ecosystem services affect farm profits, regulatory compliance, and decisions about whether to use diversification practices in the future.  These data will be integrated to construct a Markov decision-process model of the coupled natural-human system and to assess policy scenarios that may influence adoption rates of specific farming practices.  Although focused on the central coast of California, where the ecological and social costs of historically intensive agricultural production can be readily observed, findings and insights obtained through this research will have important implications in the U.S. and other nations for regions facing similar challenges related to intensive agricultural production.

Deprived of the limb's sensory feedback, roughly 80% of amputees experience intense, mysterious phantom limb pain. Scientists are developing brain-controlled prosthetics that enable patients to move their prosthetic limbs through thought, while also receiving sensory feedback (touch) from the environment back into the body. Yet touch, pain, and sensation are difficult to quantify, deeply subjective experiences, requiring a delicate process of communication, collaboration, and translation among patients, scientists, and engineers. How do patients' sensory experience, their sense of being in a body in space, and their awareness of their phantom limb, influence the development of such biotechnologies? How do patients actively participate, and even intervene, in the design of human-machine interfaces? These are the questions addressed in this project, to inform the development of biotechnologies. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project will broadly disseminate its data and findings to aid organizations in developing more effective biotechnology design and clinical practice to improve the lives of disabled individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate student, Alexandra Middleton, under the supervision of Dr. Joao Biehl of Princeton University, will investigate the role of patients as simultaneously experimental subjects and active co-innovators in human-machine interface design. To understand how the brain-machine interface is engineered, the project examines the role of patient experience and feedback in the development of biotechnology. This ethnographic research will be conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, a global epicenter of engineering brain-machine interface prosthetic technologies. The researcher will follow two clinical trials, accompanying patients as they engage with experimental neuroprosthetics in the laboratory, clinic, and their homes. These devices are the first in the world of their kind to travel outside the laboratory for home use in everyday life. Ethnographic focus will be placed on the home as a key site of science-in-the-making. Through participant observation in patients' homes and interviews with both patients and family members, the researcher will investigate how everyday experiences constitute a particular type of expertise about the use and possibilities of these devices. Circling back to the clinic and laboratory, the researcher will trace how these forms of expertise inform decisions in design as well as therapeutic communication. Archival research will examine the particular economic and social contexts that make such experimentation and development possible. Findings from this research will offer insight into the ways that human perspective and technology use can inform laboratory development and clinical communication, as well as highlighting the importance of involving disabled individuals in the design of technologies aimed at enhancing their lives. These insights will inform clinical trial design and practice among scientists, clinicians, and patients, as well as human-machine relations generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last three decades, cities across the United States have adopted strategies involving strict enforcement against low-level crimes and extensive use of pedestrian stops.  As a consequence of these changes in strategies and tactics, an increasing number of youth have involuntary contact with the criminal justice system.  The primary objective of this project is to examine the consequences of neighborhood and school-level exposure to these strategies and tactics for the educational outcomes of youth as a function of a number of factors, such as neighborhood and individual characteristics.  Findings will contribute to our understanding of the link between the criminal justice system and social opportunity.

This project aims to fabricate neuroelectric sensors and experimental protocols that would enable studying visual and higher level cognitive processes in the octopus while they are engaged in natural behaviors in an underwater environment. This will necessitate development of new engineering solutions for crafting electroencephalography (EEG) sensors that can record signal underwater, new solutions for removing noise artifacts from these highly complicated recordings, as well as careful design of experiments that could study such behaviors in a virtual-reality environment. While the brain of the octopus is very different from that of the human, it does support well-defined cognitive functions. Therefore, understanding whether and how octopuses' brains implement processes such as learning, attention, habituation, and surprise can produce new and important understandings of how neurobiological systems can support function.  This research might reveal that the neural substrates of cognitive function in the octopus are organized according to principles that differ drastically from those found in in humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project has several aims. It will develop the first underwater EEG, first testing well-validated paradigms on humans performing task underwater and benchmarking against known waveforms. The electrodes will be constructed so that they do not corrode in salt water. It will also develop high-quality virtual reality stimulation that could impact octopuses' behavior in an underwater environment. It will utilize EEG frequency-tagging techniques to determine processing of environmental stimulus by the octopus. This will allow studying whether octopuses present characteristic responses that are analogous to surprise, adaptation, working memory and attention effects (in primates and other vertebrates). The study will also allow answering how and in what manner do octopuses sleep. All data, artifacts and modeling software will be made publicly available and constitute an important resource for the community.

Matthew,,Weinberg,weinberg.133@osu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,09/15/2018,08/31/2022,98255.00,"This research studies the magnitude and determinants of prices and price-cost margins, with lessons for merger enforcement and the detection of cartels. Most empirical research assumes prices are determined by firms' product portfolios, the extent to which consumers view products as differentiated, and, importantly, competition based solely on current market conditions. However, when firms expect to compete in the future and have sufficiently low discount rates, threats of future price wars can support higher prices than predicted by static pricing models. This project explores this theory in two ways. First, the investigators develop and estimate a repeated game model of oligopoly price leadership. The assumptions in the model are motivated by an industry practice where one firm proposes a markup to a coalition. The model is then used to understand how mergers change pricing incentives. Second, the investigators develop a test of static competition that is robust to how exactly firms set prices under the alternative hypothesis. This research illustrates both methodologies with empirical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research characterizes equilibrium in the price leadership model, state conditions under which marginal costs can be recovered given data on prices, quantities, and demand estimates, and characterize conditions under which firms' implied time preferences can be identified. The investigators apply the model to the U.S. brewing industry and study how the Miller/Coors joint venture changed pricing incentives. The test for static Nash competition takes into account product differentiation and multi-product ownership by individual firms. This test is applied to the U.S. canned tuna market, where two of the three largest firms recently plead guilty to price fixing. This research shows how the framework can be used to i) date cartel operations, ii) distinguish cartel participants from firms that are simply pricing optimally given its competitors are colluding and iii) study the effectiveness of the cartel by comparing observed prices and variable profits to those that arise in Nash-Bertrand equilibrium and under joint profit maximization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monetary policy is enacted through operations of  central banks such as the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States. The operations of the Federal Reserve impacts bank decisions and therefore the credit markets. This research project develops a model to examine how monetary policy affects bank lending decisions.  The model looks at how the difference between lending and borrowing rates can be influenced by monetary policies, which in turn impacts borrowers and lenders differently. The main insight is that monetary policy can in general control credit spreads and inflation independently.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The contribution to the frontier of economics is to integrate recent frameworks that study the implementation of monetary policy through banks, into an incomplete-markets economy.  Once we conceive that monetary policy operations can control spreads and affect inflation independently, we begin to challenge many preconceived views. For example, although some monetary policy operations are long-run neutral, others are not. It is often thought that monetary policy cannot set monetary aggregates independently from policy rates. Here, monetary aggregates and rates are independent instruments that grant independent control over spreads and inflation. The model can also rationalize several empirical regularities: the presence of a liquidity effect in monetary policy expansion and a higher elasticity for loan rates than deposit rates, to policy changes. Finally, the model highlights a trade-off between the depth of a crisis and the amount of risk-insurance ex-ante, if we think of monetary policy as a macroprudential tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is of concern because of the potential public health consequences. To date issues of air pollution and soil contamination in UCGs have been understudied, yet UCGs proliferate, and have been lauded as a means of addressing questions of food access and urban sustainability. This investigation advances the understanding of human-environmental interactions and urban political ecology theory as the relationship between air pollution, soils, and gardening in cities needs to be critically evaluated for it to have the positive outcomes generally associated with it. If airborne or soil trace element sources are significant in UCG contamination, then there are potential repercussions in scholarship, policy, and the promotion of urban gardens.  As well as generating new knowledge with public health ramifications about the degree to which there is atmospheric and soil contamination in UCGs, and the contamination pathways, the project includes educational and training opportunities for gardeners, especially participants from under-represented groups. The research also broadens scholarly diversity in urban garden contamination research, and derives societal benefits in raising awareness constructively, spreading effective preventive strategies, and providing data typically beyond gardeners' reach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's aim is to evaluate the importance of bulk atmospheric deposition compared to other proximate contaminant sources, trace elements in the soil (arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel, and lead) and gardening inputs, in urban community gardens. The project systematically assesses the role of atmospheric deposition in relation to trace element contamination in urban community gardens. The investigation takes place in a sample of UCGs in New York City, where the PIs will conduct archival research about the site of each of the UCGs to develop a land-use history. In tandem they will conduct soil surveys to assess the spatial variability of trace element and determine representative soil and crop sampling points. Gardening inputs, vegetables, and soils will be sampled and analyzed for trace element concentrations. Soils will be sampled at multiple depths and analyzed for variables affecting trace element mobility. Part of the vegetables sampled will be grown under row cover to discern variables other than atmospheric deposition. Frisbee-type funnel-bottle bulk collectors will be set up and sampled monthly for a year to gather atmospheric influx data which will be compared to city air quality information. Findings are expected to be transferable to UCGs in other large cities with manufacturing histories and with decades of reliance on fossil-fuel based transport. The techniques developed through this project are also generally applicable to rural areas and small cities. Therefore, although this research project will focus on atmospheric deposition in urban community gardens, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with food production and contamination problems in urban areas in the United States and many other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Music forms an important part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and it is one of the few universals shared by all known human cultures. Yet its utility and potential evolutionary advantages remain a mystery. This project will test the hypothesis that early musical exposure has benefits that extend beyond music to critical aspects of human communication, such as speech perception in noise. In addition, the investigators will test whether early musical training is associated with less severe effects of aging on the ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. Degraded ability to understand speech in noise is a common complaint among older listeners and hearing loss has been shown to be associated with social isolation and more rapid cognitive and health declines. If formal musical training is shown to affect improved perception and speech communication in later life, the outcomes could have a potentially major impact on quality of life,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier studies have suggested relationships between early musical training and improved auditory neural processing and perception, but the studies' impact has been limited by small sample numbers and inconsistent methods between different studies.

Measures will include the neural frequency following response (FFR) to speech sounds, behavioral frequency selectivity, speech perception in noise, speech perception against a background of competing talkers, pitch discrimination, and auditory masking. The participants will also complete other assessments, including a personality inventory questionnaire, a profile of musical perception skills, a spatial reasoning test to assess general cognitive ability, as well as a background questionnaire to determine socio-economic status, education, and musical background. Participants will be selected to span a wide range of ages and musical experience. The neural data and the speech perception measures will be related to factors of musical training, such as the number of years of musical training and the age at which musical training began.

Specifically, the researcher proposes to interview 30 persons with chronic pain who are over 18 and have experienced pain persistently or intermittently for at least three months prior to recruitment. She will conduct 30-60 minute phone interviews, asking open-ended questions about the pain experiences of participants including being in pain, living with pain, and communicating about pain. She will then conduct a rhetorical analysis of interview transcripts for references to quantified information, such as quantified time, quantified medicine, and quantified expenses. The researchers will also identify and analyze other potential trends in how persons with chronic pain describe rhetorical tactics when communicating about their chronic pain. Using rhetorical analysis will allow the researchers to identify persuasive or argumentative strategies or tactics in language use about chronic pain, as described by the people living with and experiencing chronic pain. The researcher will work with regional and national patient advocacy groups and national and international professional associations dedicated to pain treatment. She will develop and disseminate a list of actionable recommendations in a variety of forms, including an accessible one-page overview, invited presentations, and peer-reviewed publication in medical journals. Her overarching goal is to help both persons with chronic pain and the people who communicate with them (including health care providers, caregivers, and loved ones) understand the rhetorical tools and strategies available to persons with chronic pain to articulate their experiences, so that this enhanced understanding might mitigate instances of stigmatization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an ethnographic study of persons with chronic pain. Between 10% and 30% of the U.S. population lives with chronic pain, and the vast majority of this population reports suffering from undertreated pain, which is further exacerbated by the stigmatization of using drugs and living with physical disability. Given the prevalence, undertreatment, and stigmatization associated with chronic pain, this project seeks to determine whether there is a rhetorical tool or strategy available to persons with chronic pain to help articulate and legitimize their pain experiences for different audiences and stakeholders (health care providers, caregivers, etc.). Anthropologists, philosophers, and bioethicists argue that this stigmatization exists, in part, because pain experience is inherently subjective and cannot be quantitatively measured. Yet, both patients and physicians are accustomed to associating medical practice with objectivity, which is in turn associated with numerical quantification. Although quantifiable information is subject to interpretation, it is because of the overwhelming persuasiveness of quantification in medical and scientific contexts in the United States that the researchers propose to investigate whether a rhetoric of quantification can benefit chronic pain patients seeking legitimization and trust in their articulations of their pain experiences. The findings of this research can advance knowledge about the persuasiveness of quantification as a rhetorical device and further enhance understanding of how objective and subjective knowledge is created, valued, and communicated in U.S. culture, particularly in the context of human health and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Description and analysis of hurricane-induced present-day coastal and inland sediment deposits are vital for deciphering the origins of storm deposits and understanding the relative contribution of a variety of sedimentary processes in different environmental settings. By using multiple proxies, this study provides accurate descriptions of the storm deposits generated by a recent intense hurricane in both the coastal and inland environments. Results from this study provide critical information for identifying ancient storm deposits in the geological record, which advances the study of past hurricane activity in the context of environmental variability at timescales of centuries and millennia.  From this analysis of hurricane impacts in deeper time societal benefits are derived because long-term records of hurricane activity are vital for accurate risk assessment for present and future coastal communities. The project also provides educational and professional development opportunities for students and faculty at a minority-serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to assess key coastal and terrestrial environments along the path of a recent hurricane, Hurricane Maria in 2017, and to identify and characterize its coastal storm surge and inland river flood deposits.

For many years, researchers argued that providing individuals and communities with open access to natural resources would inevitably lead to overuse and ultimately to destruction through deforestation, overfishing, overgrazing, and other environmentally detrimental activities. However, subsequent research by political scientist and Nobel laureate Dr. Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues found that this ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario is not universal. Instead, some small communities do effectively manage local lands without external oversight. This appears to occur most often when communities have enduring, well-developed social norms for maintaining the natural environment and for sanctioning individuals who violate community standards. But these findings raise another question: If some communities can do it, why not all? Why are some communities effective at preserving their natural resources while others are not? The research supported by this award seeks to answer that question. Anthropologist Dr. Sean S. Downey (University of Maryland) will test the theory effective land management rests on more than just having the right social norms; in addition, he suggests, the social norms, the particular characteristics of the local environment, and the ecosystem services the environment provides to local users must work together to produce ecological sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few communities in the United States are both free of external oversight and also dependent primarily on the local natural environment for subsistence. Therefore, Dr. Downey and his team will travel to two forest-based villages located in a remote area in southern Belize to test the theory. The communities have a demonstrated history of local ecological knowledge and environmental stewardship but there has historically been little top-down environmental management: an ideal location for understanding how local community norms and natural ecosystem dynamics interact and create a sustainable forestry system. The researchers will collect data through multiple methods: household surveys; farmer land use interviews; and close monitoring of how the communities affect their forests. The monitoring will be accomplished through piecing together high-resolution photographs of the usage areas around each village using a GPS-linked multi-spectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. These photos will subsequently be stitched together into geo-referenced two-dimensional photo-mosaics, ground-truthed through farm plots surveys, and analyzed to understand how these environments provide for the local communities, how they are affected by human farming activity, and also how these forests recover to sustain future generations. The research team will also conduct behavioral economics experiments to assess how cooperation and punishment in the communities relate to natural resource use, and use computational analysis to determine the most important social and natural factors for effective long-term natural resource management. The project also has several integrated educational goals, including training the next generation of American scientists, educators, and policy-makers in the science of complexity; developing coursework and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Maryland; and offering a service learning project for American students in Belize. Ultimately, findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that promote effective local management of natural resources and this could lead to better and more efficient management of public lands at a significant cost savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important research, because these patterns are important for many research questions in macroeconomics and labor economics. Measuring how American families have experienced changes in earnings and income is important for understanding how income shocks like unemployment will affect aggregate consumption. These measurements are also used by many experts in government to evaluate how government policies can affect the overall growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will combine PSID data with administrative data records to test possible explanations for observed differences between the two sets of households. Standard measures of consumption insurance obtained using PSID data imply excess insurance of permanent income shocks relative to the predictions of a standard incomplete markets model. Preliminary results suggest that once these measures are made conditional on the income dynamics of each group, the degree of insurance in each subsample is consistent with the predictions of the workhorse model. This has important implications for work that combines the two samples to get aggregate measures of the amount of insurance available to U.S. households. The project therefore contributes to labor economics and macroeconomics and may uncover the need for new and better ways to measure income and earning dynamics at the household level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Diana,,Tamir,dtamir@princeton.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,05/01/2019,04/30/2023,570800.00,"A hallmark of human experience is a sense of self.  People develop and maintain a unique set of personal memories and personality traits that define the essence of who they are.  Important lines of psychological theory and research have shown that self-knowledge is distinct from other forms of knowledge.  As an example, self-knowledge is more deeply and tightly stored in memory than other forms of knowledge.  At the same time, it is known that self-knowledge is not rigid or fixed in memory; like other forms of knowledge, it can be malleable and change over time.  An important focus of past research has considered the conditions under which a person's self-knowledge might change.  This project focuses on one such potential condition: the act of thinking about or simulating other people.  This focus recognizes that one's sense of self develops in and is influenced by social life.  A child's sense of self develops partly as a result of imaginary companions and learning how to take the perspective of others.  Comparing ourselves to others is also known to have a strong influence on one's own sense of self.  This project integrates insights from basic memory research, social psychology, and neuroscience to gain insight into how it is that simulating other minds changes the content of self-knowledge.  Because one's self-concept can be a powerful predictor of behaviors and life outcomes, this research offers important practical implications.  One such application concerns the barriers to female participation and advancement in STEM education and occupations.  Relative to their male counterparts, females see fewer successful role models (others) who are ""like them.""  As a result, females have fewer opportunities to accumulate self-knowledge that encourages the valuing and pursuit of a career in STEM.  This project offers a novel solution -- simulating successful others -- that may help diminish this barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis that imagination can change self-knowledge derives naturally from two well-established research literatures.  Social cognition research has found that people retrieve self-knowledge when imagining, or ""simulating,"" how another person is thinking or feeling.  Memory research has found that when information is retrieved, it enters a labile state and can be contaminated with newly presented information.  Together, these two lines of research suggest that when simulating another person, retrieved self-knowledge may become temporarily labile.  In this state, self-knowledge may blend together with information about the other person.  As a result of simulation, self-knowledge may then incorporate information about the person one is simulating.  The outcome is a change in the self to become more similar to the other.  This phenomenon is Simulation-Induced Malleability (SIM).  Preliminary studies offer evidence for SIM: people's personal episodic memories, personality traits, and physical traits become more similar to how they imagined another person's experiences and traits, and these changes are long-lasting.  This project leverages diverse approaches to test specific predictions regarding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie how SIM changes the self.  It also considers the consequences and social applications of SIM.  The research integrates insights from online, in-lab, and longitudinal behavioral methods, along with advanced multivariate neuroimaging techniques, to develop a comprehensive assessment of Simulation-Induced Malleability.  It will inform the longstanding and widespread problem of gender disparities in STEM fields, thereby helping to advance the science of broadening participation.  Open source data and analysis tools will be shared with research communities in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to facilitate applications and future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, understanding how people use these multiple sources of information is fundamental to understanding and predicting choices.  Established approaches within psychology allow examination these processes in some situations. For example, to explore decision stages, a decision-maker may be asked to describe her thought process when making a choice, and that description is used to inform the researcher. In many situations, direct information about the choice processes is not accessible. For example, a decision maker may search her memory to find the information that could be used for choosing between options. When memory search is fast, people rarely have clear insight into how the memories were accessed and used. To allow for investigating decisions based on multiple sources of information across the widest range of situations, the principal investigators will integrate a powerful methodology based on mathematical cognitive modelling with standard decision-making research methodologies. The research will accomplish three objectives: (1) to gain an important understanding how multiple sources of information are combined during decision making, (2) conduct new empirical tests of the fundamental process across different decision making tasks, and (3) rigorously compare among the top decision making theories based on the new empirical findings.  These results will inform decision makers, allow assessment of decision making efficiency, and enable better models of choice behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, several decision making models were proposed that can account for many of the typical findings in human decision making, using both choice accuracy and response time output measures. However, no clear agreement about the underlying cognitive mechanism has been reached. These models can often be distinguished by strong implications about the processes that lead to a decision. Specifically, these models imply (a) how information is searched for, (b) when this information search is stopped, and (c) how the acquired information is integrated to reach the decision. Nonetheless, the disagreement remains.  In part this is due to model mimicking:  Without appropriate experimental design and analysis, different theories can make equivalent predictions. For example, inferences based on traditional mean response time (RT) analysis are limited due to model mimicking, as different decision-making models can imply exactly the same mean response time patterns. To overcome this limitation, we will integrate the powerful systems factorial technology (SFT) with traditional decision-making methods. SFT has been successfully applied in a wide range of perceptual and cognitive tasks to identify processing order, stopping rule and process dependency (a, b, and c from above), but has only been applied to decision making in very limited way.  Our research will link SFT to the classical methods in judgment and decision making to improve our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying decision-making.  Our project will also contribute to improving the professional academic development of undergraduate and graduate students at two state universities that traditionally have fewer research opportunities for students.  All aspects of this research project, from methodology to theoretical development, will be communicated at national and international professional Furthermore, the research will be submitted for publication in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals. One of the aims of the proposed research is to disseminate the findings to a broader audience through our respective university press offices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concomitant with the creation of these new roles, however, has been the rise of high-profile controversies around the potential abusive use of big data and of the algorithms whose creation they enable. This project thus focuses on 'data science ethics' and works to understand how to best cultivate a culture of ethics in data science. It will assess the state, structure, and substance of data ethics in both educational and industrial contexts. Within the academic sector, the project will conduct interviews with faculty and undergraduates and analyze relevant syllabi to develop an account of what constitutes data ethics in the academy. Comparing these data across faculty and disciplines will show major areas of agreement and disagreement over what data ethics education should entail. Within the industrial sector, the project will research how data ethics are beginning to figure into corporate practice and study how companies define data ethics and attempt to integrate ethical considerations into everyday work. Data will come from in-depth interviews with those in industry and analyses of corporate documents from companies that have made public commitments to addressing data ethics. The PIs would then compare data and findings from across these two contexts to identify commonalities, differences, and useful strategies for advancing data ethics across social contexts and professional sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will draw together a diverse group of researchers who in collaboration with educators and data science practitioners will: (1) document and assess barriers and opportunities for integrating ethics into data science practice; (2) assess the continuities and discontinuities emerging between industrial and academic contexts; and (3) develop a foundation for cohesive, comprehensive, integrative data ethics education. The investigators will use a range of complementary methods to do so, including qualitative interviews, expert judgement, and quantitative computational analyses of the latent thematic and topical structure of documents from academia and industry. Project outcomes and findings will be disseminated through conferences, journals, and through holding a synthetic workshop after the completion of data collection and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, studying campaigns and their effects is difficult. This is particularly true when it comes to situations where numerous elections are taking place in a single country at one time. In this project, the PIs build on data that have been collected since 2002, analyzing large samples of candidate websites and conducting surveys of candidate campaigns. These data provide a holistic picture of a wide range of campaigns-both winners and losers-and offer scholars and citizens the ability to assess what campaigns do, why they do it, and how it might relate to subsequent governing. The intellectual merit to the project is that the data will allow scholars and citizens access to unprecedented data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ.  The broader impact is that the enhanced understanding of campaigns that these data will provide will enable practitioners to identify sources of political change and discuss reforms that could ultimately improve campaign quality. The project also will involve students who will learn how to conduct research and be able to use the data in their own work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States, citizens choose their representatives in part based on campaigns. Yet, campaigns are difficult to study as they involve so many candidates, many of whom run relatively low-cost, small campaigns. One way to obtain a representative sample of campaign discourse is to rely on candidate websites since virtually all candidates have websites. Websites also are ideal insofar as campaigns view them as holistic portraits of messages aimed at voters. Since 2002, the PIs have coded campaign websites and conducted surveys of campaigns. The result is an unprecedented data set of campaign behavior over-time. In this project, the PIs will extend that data into the upcoming election, which is of particular interest given increased affective polarization and incivility, and the nationalization of elections. The intellectual merit to the project is that it will allow scholars and citizens access to data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ.

The researchers will examine what factors make small enterprises successful, including the organization and composition of labor and the identification of markets, as well as factors that contribute to failure. Archaeology is particularly useful in addressing these issues due to the material evidence of production, distribution of goods, and the ability to investigate changes over time. The research is important to the United States economy, which includes both large corporations, as well as small businesses, including family-run enterprises. Why do certain factors allow some enterprises to succeed and other's fail? Students, many who are first-generation college students, will be trained in the use of technologies such as Global Positioning Systems, Geographic Information Systems, and 3D digital imaging, all marketable skills in addition to participating in interdisciplinary research in archaeology.  Descendant communities as well as other interested people will be involved in workshops to share findings from the project as well as 3D printed replicas for exhibits.

As a basic daily necessity, salt was scarce at inland cities so its production on the coast figures into supply and demand of a good distributed at inland marketplaces in cities, towns, and smaller communities. Previous archaeological survey, mapping, and transect excavations indicated massive salt production. However, there were unanswered questions about the workforce, including if they lived near the salt works or elsewhere, if production was organized by households who worked individual salt kitchens or by day or seasonal workers from elsewhere. The researchers will carry out aerial excavations inside multiple buildings and in the adjacent yards at two large archaeological sites to identify residential, production, and other uses. In addition, excavations will be carried out at smaller sites in five different areas of the salt works. Interdisciplinary collaboration includes study of mineralogy of pottery to identify the sources of manufacture as a proxy for the locations of inland markets and consumers. The study incorporates soil chemistry to identify chemical residues of activities, along with quantitative and spatial evaluation of salt production tools.

High courts are called on to be final arbiters of constitutional meaning. The Kenyan Supreme Court's invalidation of the August 2017 presidential election and directive for a new election in late October 2017 presents a crucial test of the Court's institutional legitimacy, or rightful authority to render constitutional and legal rulings for the polity. This project examines how the public has responded to this landmark ruling, as well as to the new election that the Court has ordered. Do citizens' ethnic and partisan affiliations drive their assessments of the Supreme Court's legitimacy in light of this landmark ruling? Or can perceptions of procedural fairness and other non-policy factors overcome ethnic or partisan bias and build a reservoir of legitimacy for the Court? These questions are incredibly important in an emerging democracy like Kenya with a high court that has a short institutional history. Mass and elite responses to the Court's actions will set a strong precedent for the future of the rule of law and democratic governance, not only in Kenya but in Africa writ large. Moreover, a history of mass public protests and violence in response to controversial elections makes understanding the public's response to this episode extremely important for theoretical, empirical, and normative reasons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will test theoretical hypotheses centered on process-based (procedural fairness, subscription to democratic values) versus outcome-based (ethnic or partisan disagreement with Court outcomes) models of institutional legitimacy. These hypotheses with a two-wave national panel survey, which includes a survey experiment, of Kenyan citizens. Using an oversample of control group respondents from the first wave, descriptive statistics related to legitimacy and other Court-related assessments and examine the effects of process and outcome-based factors on legitimacy and other evaluations will be generated. A field experiment will also be conducted to allow identification of the causal effects of procedural fairness and elite cues, both countervailing and aligning with ethnopartisan preferences' on Supreme Court legitimacy. The experiment will also examine whether procedural fairness and countervailing elite cues can attenuate ethnopartisan bias in legitimacy judgments. Finally, the second wave survey will allow the identification of how different ethno-partisans' attitudes toward the Supreme Court change in light of the outcome of the new election.  Examining these changes will provide an additional test of the outcome-based model and examine how and whether reactions (both positive and negative) to the court?s decision persist into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, flood, drought, and contamination mark several ways that water can also pose a threat to life. Human activity -- such as mismanagement, travel, pollution, conflict, and widening social disparities -- can also contribute to water's potential danger, including the spread of deadly waterborne diseases. Sudden or otherwise dramatic disruptions in drinking-water quality expose important ways that humans value such an invaluable resource. To develop programs, policies, and infrastructure that ensure all Americans access to safe water, it is critical to understand not only the interacting human and environmental factors that lead to drinking-water contamination, but also the ways that individuals and societies adjust to water crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new presence of cholera in Haiti provides an exemplary case through which to study the dynamic relationship between humans and water. Cholera is a waterborne disease that causes profuse diarrhea and possible death from rapid fluid loss. The investigators, who started traveling to Haiti in 2008, have been researching the cholera epidemic there since it began in 2010, nine months after the earthquake. The investigators' extensive understanding of the local context, robust network of contacts, and previous data with which to make comparisons will foster the successful implementation and impact of forthcoming research. The research will be conducted in the coastal city and surrounding rural areas of Saint-Marc, Haiti, near the mouth of the Artibonite River, which was contaminated with cholera bacteria in October 2010, sparking one of the largest cholera epidemics in recent history. Though preventable by drinking clean water and treatable with timely rehydration, and despite significant national and international investment in relief efforts, many Haitians remain vulnerable to infection. With the disease now endemic, the presence of cholera has likely prompted substantial changes in the political economy, management, and consumption of water in Haiti. Investigators will assess the extent to which drinking-water for many Haitians has gone from a trusted common resource to a market commodity, industrialized product, or privately administered good. They will also evaluate whether these changes, driven by local and international actors, are resulting in improved access to safe water, particularly among the poor. Based in Saint-Marc, investigators will conduct interviews, archival, and participant-based research, observe and participate in everyday life, shadow clinicians, water engineers, and water entrepreneurs, and collect quantitative data about water quality and household water use. Research findings about the ways disease, the environment, and human society influence one another will illuminate factors that promote, perpetuate, or protect against water insecurity, poverty, and illness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The result will be a better understanding of which groups get invited, how and when committee hearings are used to investigate social movement mobilization, and a map of the relationships between the different social movements that are represented at hearings. One benefit of this project is a new dataset of broad interest to social scientists studying politics that also builds bridges between existing NSF datasets.

NCSES conducts a large number of surveys to measure these characteristics; however, social and technological changes, such as declining survey response rates, constrained budget and staff resources, and alternative sources of data from non-government sources, are making surveys more expensive to conduct and less useful. The Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will conduct two projects for NCSES to improve the relevance and usefulness of its statistical programs and help it address a changing world.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project is focused on better measurement of scientific work.  Because many of the most pressing questions confronting science and society today -- in fields ranging from cell research and nanotechnology to environmental studies and beyond -- are large and complex problems which are inherently interdisciplinary in character, they require collaborative research using multiple methods and approaches from different disciplines. This has been referred to as convergent research, and it is vital that NCSES be able to accurately measure convergent research to inform science policy about the patterns of this research and how it links to scientific advances.  However, measurement of this work is difficult because there is no single accepted definition. To assist NCSES in being able to gather useful data on the extent of convergence in scientific training and research, CNSTAT will convene a workshop to identify and discuss issues in measuring convergence and its implications for the science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce and the S&amp;E enterprise more broadly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second project is focused on expanding the kinds of data NCSES uses for its statistical program, to potentially incorporate the use of administrative records and other data sets to produce statistics that are relevant, timely, and of high quality for the science policy and research communities. However, using these data sources requires transparency in the sources, quality of data, and methods used so users are able to assess whether the statistics produced are fit for their intended purposes, and for comparison with results from other agencies and countries. In June, 2017, NSF supported a CNSTAT workshop that examined various aspects of transparency and reproducibility of data products from federal statistical agencies, and it was clear that the current approaches to transparency and reproducibility could be improved.  Presentations from other countries highlighted the development of a variety of tools, which could be useful for achieving greater transparency and supporting greater use and reuse of statistical data in the United States.

Moreover, what does their success tell us about the micro-level workings of state power and its capacities to shape the lives of marginalized groups?  This research studies the significance of street-level bureaucracy, i.e. frontline workers, in negotiating state power, and the inter-relationship of intimate labor with inequities of gender, class, and ethnicity. Findings will show how community health workers negotiate, and often overcome, social and symbolic boundaries in their communities. This has implications for global health. Community health worker programs are critical for the effective delivery of health services in low- and middle-income countries, especially for marginalized populations. By emphasizing the experiences of these workers in negotiating the dynamics of their communities, this research will generate policy recommendations about how to better support community health workers in their role. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will study a) the reasons why women continue to work as community health volunteers; b) the meaning that this work has for them, beyond their formal tasks; and c) how caste affects their experiences with their community on the one hand, and with the health system on the other. The project will conduct a relational ethnography of Dalit, formerly untouchable, and dominant caste community health volunteers in the two districts of Muktsar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar in Punjab, India. The North Indian state of Punjab presents a privileged case in terms of overall prosperity and social mobility for Dalits relative to the rest of India. Within Punjab, Muktsar and SBS Nagar are two districts that have similar percentages of Dalits in the population, but differ on key indices of economic mobility, such as literacy. The community health volunteers are pre-dominantly lower caste, working class women. The project expects that while gender and caste act to subsidize the state, the state also provides opportunities for these women to mitigate their marginalization by according them status and access otherwise unavailable to them. Comparing Muktsar and SBS Nagar will allow for a nuanced understanding of caste not as static social identity, but rather as reproduced dynamically in the context of the local political economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Perception uses similarity: when viewing a person's face, we (unconsciously) calculate its similarity to the faces of people we know in order to recognize who we are looking at. Categorization uses similarity: when judging whether a building was designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, we calculate its similarity to buildings known to have been designed by Wright in order to make our best estimate. Reasoning and problem solving use similarity: when attempting to solve a calculus problem, we calculate its similarity to previous problems that we have encountered in order to determine a good solution strategy. However, how people calculate the similarity of two items is not yet understood. Which features of items do people use to calculate similarity? And how are the feature values of items compared in order to calculate similarity? This research project will use human experimentation and computational modeling to address these questions when items are viewed or grasped. A long-term benefit of the project is that a greater understanding of people's perceptual similarity judgments will provide a foundation for understanding how people calculate and use similarity in other areas of cognition. While conducting the research, undergraduate and graduate students will be mentored in the cross-disciplinary approach embodied in our investigation through participation in both experimental and computational aspects of the research project. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing a new empirical and theoretical foundation for understanding people's notions of similarity, particularly in the domain of perceptual similarity.  The field of cognitive science is well aware that understanding similarity is essential to understanding human cognition. Despite this, the primary motivation for this project is the belief that, to date, cognitive science's approach to the study of similarity judgments is much too simple---the restricted class of similarity metrics considered by cognitive scientists is unlikely to scale to large, realistic settings. The primary hypothesis of this project is that the field of machine learning---especially the study of metric learning---can supply cognitive science with a rich array of complex and sophisticated models, models that will be necessary to accurately characterize people's similarity notions in large, realistic domains. Machine learning has pioneered the study of mathematically rigorous linear and nonlinear similarity metrics. We believe that the time is ripe for the field of cognitive science to make use of machine learning's recent advances. Machine learning's metric learning framework extends and elaborates the cognitive science approach in principled and innovative new directions. Indeed, this framework presents an unparalleled opportunity for cognitive science with the potential for transforming this field. Using the empirical and theoretical findings from machine learning, cognitive scientists can now begin to explore human notions of similarity in more complex and sophisticated ways---and in more realistic domains---than has ever been possible. We regard the research project as an early step for cognitive science towards a more sophisticated understanding of people's notions of similarity. Because the project cannot study similarity in all domains of human cognition, it concentrates on perception. Future work will need to develop further the models proposed and evaluated here. If successful, the program will establish an empirical and theoretical foundation that can subsequently be extended to many other areas of human cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordinary documents, such as driver's licenses and ID cards, can be critically important in the lives of modern citizens. However, governments everywhere regularly undertake reforms that create new documents and alter or eliminate old ones.  Previous research has assessed the functionality of reforms, but less attention has been paid to how the very repetitiveness of reforms affects the state-citizen relationship. Filling this gap is important because changes made with the goal of improving technologies or streamlining bureaucracies may have unintended, negative consequences that could be avoided if they were better understood before the changes were made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by University of Chicago anthropology doctoral student, Do Dom Kim, with the oversight of Dr. Julie Y. Chu. The researchers have sited the project in Shenzhen, China, where documentation reforms have been occurring frequently and urban redevelopment and impending mass relocation have made the stakes of documentation practices high. This heightened importance of documentation will make the object of analysis easier to isolate for research purposes than in might be in a less documentation-rich and documentation-centric environment.  The researchers will collect data on how people facing critical life decisions such as eviction, employment, marriage, and family planning, mobilize documentation in this quickly changing political, legal, and technological environment. They will employ a combination of ethnographic methodologies including interviews, discourse analysis of policy documents, and archival research.  Findings from the research will contribute to scholarship on the state-citizen relationship, internal displacement, and socialist law. In addition, findings will be shared policymakers concerned to understand how people adapt to documentation reforms as well as the long-term sociocultural consequences of constant policy changes, particularly in the context of migration and urban redevelopment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent studies in both the social and evolutionary sciences have taken a more pronounced focus on cooperation, seeking to understand how unrelated groups work together and form formal communities. These investigations often focus on groups that follow hunting and gathering and limited agricultural economies. Archaeology has the ability to inform on the history of practices that belie such cooperation though an analysis of the built environment, particularly through the study of the form of monuments and constructed civic-ceremonial spaces. Reconstructing the building and occupational sequences, as well as the intensity of use, at such places is one measure of how cooperation and co-residence became entrenched among these communities. The primary contribution of this research will be to advance understanding of institutional development among hunter-gatherer-fishers, and the degree and context in which such groups managed to cooperate in large-scale labor projects over extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To conduct this research the project will investigate the site of Fort Center, a multi-mound ceremonial complex in the southern Florida interior that exhibited periods of monument construction and co-residence among hunter-gatherer-fishers for over 2000 years. This research will address two interrelated trajectories: (1) Identify the intensity of activity change over time (e.g., shifts from a periodic usage to more continual activity). (2) Determine if shifts in the intensity of activities in other areas correspond with novel types of monumental architecture. Following the identification and extent of both domestic and communal middens, the investigators will conduct excavations within identified middens at the site. These excavations will provide samples to create a robust radiocarbon chronology, identify rates of accumulation both spatially and through time, and also determine the distribution of middens to interpret related activities.

The focus is on health care services provision and it is intended to find out whether the proposed approach to the research will work.  The project will implement two experiments.  The first experiment will involve a quarterly meeting in which local political leaders report on healthcare delivery at local government healthcare facilities to the general population.  This experiment is designed as a test of how effectively local politicians are playing their supervisory roles in the health sector.  The second experiment involves training of local political leaders on skills in monitoring local government health centers.  The results of this research will help to address widespread management accountability failures that lead to inability to provide public services in many parts of the world.   The results could also help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of US external assistance programs to low income countries.  It will also provide ways of improving the delivery of public goods and democratic governance through sustained citizen engagement in many parts of the world.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a feasibility study and pilot randomized controlled trial of two governance interventions designed to address constraints on health service provision.  The objective of the pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention and data collection activities.  Centering on the role of politicians' performance in delivering healthcare, the study will implement wo interventions: (a) increased citizen participation through quarterly reporting meetings with local politicians on the quality of health service delivery and (b) local leader skills training in monitoring local government health centers. Data collection will consist of pre- and post-intervention household surveys and health facility audits, along with observational surveys during the citizen-politician meetings.  Despite the attention given to the role of governance in service delivery and development, relatively little rigorous evidence exists on interventions to strengthen local institutions. In contrast to studies that focus on interventions in laboratory settings, this study will evaluate a governance intervention targeting inefficiencies in the political economy.  It also investigates supply-side barriers to healthcare delivery, which are likely another essential side of health care issues in many countries. Altogether, the study will shed light on institutional dynamics in low-resource health systems.

Thus, understanding how people use these multiple sources of information is fundamental to understanding and predicting choices.  Established approaches within psychology allow examination these processes in some situations. For example, to explore decision stages, a decision-maker may be asked to describe her thought process when making a choice, and that description is used to inform the researcher. In many situations, direct information about the choice processes is not accessible. For example, a decision maker may search her memory to find the information that could be used for choosing between options. When memory search is fast, people rarely have clear insight into how the memories were accessed and used. To allow for investigating decisions based on multiple sources of information across the widest range of situations, the principal investigators will integrate a powerful methodology based on mathematical cognitive modelling with standard decision-making research methodologies. The research will accomplish three objectives: (1) to gain an important understanding how multiple sources of information are combined during decision making, (2) conduct new empirical tests of the fundamental process across different decision making tasks, and (3) rigorously compare among the top decision making theories based on the new empirical findings.  These results will inform decision makers, allow assessment of decision making efficiency, and enable better models of choice behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, several decision-making models were proposed that can account for many of the typical findings in human decision making, using both choice accuracy and response time output measures. However, no clear agreement about the underlying cognitive mechanism has been reached. These models can often be distinguished by strong implications about the processes that lead to a decision. Specifically, these models imply (a) how information is searched for, (b) when this information search is stopped, and (c) how the acquired information is integrated to reach the decision. Nonetheless, the disagreement remains.  In part this is due to model mimicking:  Without appropriate experimental design and analysis, different theories can make equivalent predictions. For example, inferences based on traditional mean response time (RT) analysis are limited due to model mimicking, as different decision-making models can imply exactly the same mean response time patterns. To overcome this limitation, we will integrate the powerful systems factorial technology (SFT) with traditional decision-making methods. SFT has been successfully applied in a wide range of perceptual and cognitive tasks to identify processing order, stopping rule and process dependency (a, b, and c from above), but has only been applied to decision making in very limited way.  Our research will link SFT to the classical methods in judgment and decision making to improve our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying decision making.  Our project will also contribute to improving the professional academic development of undergraduate and graduate students at two state universities that traditionally have fewer research opportunities for students.  All aspects of this research project, from methodology to theoretical development, will be communicated at national and international professional Furthermore, the research will be submitted for publication in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Kelly Knudson at Arizona State University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating how spatial variation in stable and radiogenic isotopes throughout complex hydrological systems can be used to ""geo-locate"" or assign human or animal individuals of unknown geographic origin to specific places of origin along an isotopic landscape or ""isoscape"" Mammalian tissues record the signature of oxygen and strontium isotopes from the food, water, and air consumed during the period of development. Comparing oxygen and strontium tissue values enables the identification of outlier individuals, or first-generation migrant. However, to match migrants to their places of origin, it is first necessary to develop predictive, spatially-explicit isotope models of oxygen and strontium values throughout a study region. This project will systematically collect samples of water, soil, plants, and animals from ten major river valleys, analyze these materials to establish isotopic baseline values, and generate predictive dual-isotope and single-isotope models. Human archaeological values will then be matched to their most likely place of origin using probabilistic statistical methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, conducted with the Archaeological Chemistry Laboratory of the Center for Bioarchaeological Research and the W. M. Keck Foundation Laboratory for Environmental Biogeochemistry at Arizona State University, analyzes biogeochemical variation in order to generate predictive isotope models for the probabilistic determination of provenience and isotopic life histories. The Fellow will carry out dry and wet season sampling campaigns, systematically collecting environmental samples of water, soil, plants, and fauna from regular altitudinal intervals. Samples from 100 control points will be re-sampled in the wet and dry season to understand the impact of seasonal weather patterns on isotope values. Archaeological applications of these methods can be used to trace ancient migration and trade networks between specific locations, or to identify the isotopic provenience of important people or artifacts. Importantly, this project will also establish a database, which will be a collaborative, cloud-based application for collecting and sharing isotope baseline data before and after publication. The field collection side of the database will be critical in standardizing the collection of baseline data, which will allow the scientific community to explore the relationships between landscape conditions and isotope values. The data-sharing side of the database will allow professionals and scientists access to isotope data and isoscape models, which will provide a tool for helping forensic and other researchers to pinpoint likely origins for individuals. These data and methods will serve as the foundation for geostatistically robust baseline maps, which can be used by anthropologists to understand human responses to environmental and cultural change, by ecologists or biologists working with these species, or by researchers investigating similar questions throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How these processes relate to environmental and ecological factors, however, is poorly understood and this limits understanding of societal evolution. This project seeks to shed insight into the socio-ecological factors underlying the emergence of monument construction.These processes will be investigated through archaeological and environmental investigations on the island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), famous for its elaborate religious monumental architecture. The famous monuments of Rapa Nui are at great risk of being destroyed by erosion, storm surges, and development. This research will result in the creation of high-resolution 3D models to be used as digital documentation and preservation tools to help conserve Rapa Nui's monument sites. This is an urgent need and a goal that will be achieved through an on-going collaborative partnership with Rapanui archaeologists and stakeholders. This project also involves several education, training, and outreach initiatives, including training of American and Rapanui students in archaeological survey and geospatial field techniques, training and dissertation completion for Co-PI DiNapoli, and dissemination of results in both academic and public media. These initiatives will directly contribute to enhancing collaborative relationships, training for underrepresented groups, and public engagement in archaeological science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test predictions of an evolutionary ecology model known as costly-signaling theory for the origins of monument construction using Rapa Nui as a case study. Given Rapa Nui's small size, isolation, and plethora of religious monuments, it offers an ideal model system to investigate the evolutionary ecology of monument construction. The central hypothesis is that, in addition to their well-known religious roles, monuments functioned within Rapa Nui society as conspicuous displays (i.e., costly signals) of communities' competitive ability to control and defend their limited critical resources, which resulted in limited violent conflict or interaction between groups. This hypothesis will be tested through archaeological and environmental investigations of:  1) the energetic costs of building monuments; 2) their visibility on the landscape; 3) relationships between the costs of building monuments, their visibility, and contested subsistence resources; and 4) the degree of interaction between prehistoric communities. These objectives will be approached through a series of geospatial field techniques, quantitative analyses, and geochemical sampling. All data and analyses will be made fully open-access, which is crucial for reproducible research in archaeological science. This project has the potential to advance anthropological theory and a broader understanding of societal change by illuminating the social and ecological influences behind why cooperation, competition, and religiosity were so frequently manifested as monumental architecture in the human past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will begin by assuming that individual consumers, workers, and firms can be modeled as making their decisions according to a particular type of machine learning algorithm (a boosting algorithm). The project seeks to understand the conditions under which a machine learning algorithm can emulate the decision-making process of a rational individual. The team will also analyze likely long run economic outcomes when these algorithms are used under various institutional and informational assumptions. The project, therefore, may develop a valuable new technique for modeling individual decisions in the context of an entire economic system. It could also help us understand how future economic outcomes may be affected by the increased use of machine learning methods to aid or even substitute for human decision making. The project could therefore help guide efforts to improve the competitiveness of the US economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will exploit one of the central components of the machine learning algorithm, called the boosting algorithm, to build a highly accurate forecasting rule from a collection of rudimentary and possibly inaccurate forecasting rules. The usual approach in economic models is to assume that the agents (individuals, firms, etc.) are typically endowed with misspecified models. When this is the case, an individual or firm's decision-making process typically relies on simple, yet well fit, forecasting rules, which can differ from the true data generating process. The team aim to understand whether an agent endowed with flawed but well fit models can behave as if she knows the true data generating process.  The team plans to pursue this objective in two steps. In the first part of the project, the team will examine learning dynamics under misspecified models.  As an example, it examines a new class of learning models in which the agent has to learn the growth rate instead of the level of a variable of interest. In many macroeconomic models, the growth rate (e.g., inflation rate) rather than the level of a variable (e.g., price) is the main focus of the investigation.  Assuming that the agent learns the growth rate through a recursive learning process rather than rational expectations may result in better explanations of important macroeconomic dynamics, such as recurrent hyperinflation and stock price volatility. The second step in the research plan investigates the dynamics of a specific machine learning algorithm with two research objectives:  [1] if an agent is endowed with misspecified models, how the decision maker can test and build a new model to improve the forecast, and [2] what are the asymptotic properties of the processes of constructing new models, in particular whether the agent can emulate the rational agent in the long run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current core mathematical models are well-understood for simple environments but difficult to extend to more complicated environments. This project will develop new basic modeling tools, with the aim of broadening the scope of the theory. The tools will allow researchers to better design incentive schemes for complex environments, including incentive schemes that guarantee performance despite uncertainties about the economic environment. The integrated education plan includes an interdisciplinary conference to connect theorists in mechanism design with experts in potential application areas; and outreach activities with high school students and educators interested in advanced mathematical problem solving to build awareness of this fruitful area of study. This research promotes the national interest because it will guide the design of better incentive mechanisms. Existing theory in this area has historically had many applications, including taxation, regulation, procurement, and corporate finance. New theory will allow further improvements and better efficiency in these and other areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall project has three main components. (1) Multidimensional mechanism design. Major workhorse models typically assume agents' preferences are summarized by a one-dimensional parameter; extending these models to multiple dimensions is widely viewed as challenging, yet important. This research will adapt a new modeling approach, based on uncertainty about the correlation across dimensions of preference, to study several questions concerning when and why simple mechanisms can deliver good guarantees. (2) Mechanism design when agents' information is endogenous. In many situations, agents can take costly actions to either acquire relevant information or influence others' information before an economic interaction, and a planner designing the interaction may be concerned that this gaming is socially wasteful. This project characterizes mechanisms that give robust guarantees when such ""information games"" are considered. (3) Design of incentives in situations of moral hazard, when it is unknown exactly what actions agents can take. This project considers several theoretical questions on this theme, focusing on understanding when simple incentive structures can be optimally robust in complex situations.

Researchers will examine whether the presence of certain sleep patterns and features, exhibited by children prior to Hurricane Harvey, decreases or increases risk of poor social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning. The primary hypothesis is that pre-disaster sleep characterized by (a) less total and more fragmented REM (rapid eye movement) sleep periods; (b) less slow wave sleep; (c) less sleep spindle activity; and (d) longer sleep onset latency, will amplify the negative effects of hurricane exposure on social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning. Emotional functioning will be assessed using subjective reports as well as psychophysiology (electrodermal activity, respiratory sinus arrhythmia). Families will also complete a semi-structured diagnostic clinical interview to assess for psychiatric diagnoses.  This study has the potential to inform models of trauma. This study will help the general public better understand the impact natural disasters have on children. This proposal is appropriate for the NSF RAPID mechanism because the ephemeral nature of the data to be collected means there is an urgency to the project. The ability to begin collecting data as soon as possible is crucial."

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience. This project will establish new multidisciplinary approaches to tackle such complex problems as climate change adaptation, and train graduate students from the partner institutions and countries in international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vining and his team will examine how prehispanic agriculturalists developed and switched between various productive strategies as the el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) changed in frequency and severity.  The study region, north coastal Peru, hosted a series of civilizations between approximately 2000 BC - 1450 AD, including the Moche, Lambayeque, and Chimu societies.  However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.  The researchers will use this multidisplinary methodological background to improve historic reconstructions of past ENSO variations, record archaeological examples of agricultural technologies in their environmental context, and reconstruct how different strategies were employed as ENSO effected climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite considerable advances by women in education and the labor market, gender gaps in earnings, particularly among the highly-skilled, continue to persist. This project focuses on less traditional explanations, such as the role of systematic differences in preferences and beliefs between men and women in the job search process in explaining the observed gender wage gaps.  The proposed research will be based on a survey of recent business school graduates of Boston University.  This is the first study that uses this unique approach to explain the gender wage gap at the beginning of careers.  The insights from this research can help individuals make informed decisions in the job search process and enable policymakers to design more effective policy interventions to tackle gender disparities in the labor market. The findings also have implications for how to improve the job search process, such as design of effective recruiting policies and informational interventions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, consisting of two projects, investigates the effects of willingness to negotiate, overconfidence, and risk aversion on the observed gender wage gap.  It is based on a large-scale survey of negotiation and job behavior that the researchers conducted among recent undergraduate alumni from Boston University?s Questrom school of Business. The first project is motivated by the empirical observation that women are less likely to negotiate in a variety of settings. The PIs will use a randomized field experiment to assess whether providing information about gender differences in negotiation rates and the efficacy of negotiation is effective in closing the gender gap in negotiation and starting pay among current Questrom business graduates. The PIs will also collect experimentally measured traits to reveal channels through which information impacts graduates. The second project utilizes information on job offers and acceptances from the alumni survey to study the interactions among risk preferences, overconfidence, and job search behavior, and the resulting impact on the gender earnings gap. Because job search is a dynamic process that involves uncertainty, gender differences in preferences and beliefs are likely to lead to gender differences in job search behavior and starting salaries. This project will establish basic facts about gender differences in the job search process, and explore how these relate to gender differences in risk preferences and overconfidence. The PIs will also conduct sequential job search experiments in the laboratory to understand how gender gaps in labor market outcomes evolve under different mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many real-world decisions, which of the available alternatives is chosen is influenced by many different attributes. Such multi-attribute decisions are complex because they require the integration and comparison of many pieces of information. For instance, selecting the bundle of goods that maximizes value given a budget constraint in a supermarket that only stocks 100 different goods requires checking approximately 10^30 possible combinations. For this reason, humans do not use rational choice theory in all their decisions. In addition to having to combine the influence of all the different attributes, another complexity is that one alternative is often preferable on one set of attributes, but another is preferred on others. Making a choice then requires a trade-off, which further complicates the decision process. However, the cognitive and neural processes that are at the heart of preference formation are still poorly understood.  This complexity is thought to tax limited cognitive resources in humans who therefore can pay attention only to a limited set of information, on which the decision is then based. In addition, task history often systematically changes decision biases. This research program takes advantage of the opportunity to obtain direct recordings from individual's brains while they perform such complex decision. It will study these activity patterns to determine whether they can be explained via mathematical models of decision making. Understanding which attributes are considered during decision making, and how they are weighted could explain decision making in typical and a-typical populations. Furthermore this integrative research program forms an opportunity to expose engineering students to dynamical systems and control theories in an interdisciplinary context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines behavioral data, neural recordings in humans (patients undergoing epilepsy evaluation) implanted with multiple depth electrodes covering many cortical and subcortical brain areas, and computational approaches to develop a new theory of the neural mechanisms underlying multi-attribute decision-making in complex environments. This is a unique opportunity to study brain circuits simultaneously across multiple brain areas while humans make these decisions.  The overall goal of the present proposal is to understand the neural circuit involved in (1) representing the relevant decision variables, (2) integrating these variables to form subjective values, and (3) selecting one of the options in multi-attribute decisions. Participants, with implanted electrodes, will work in a novel behavioral task that makes it possible to observe their focus of attention while they evaluate the offers and select one of them.  Data will constrain cutting edge computational models of multi-attribute decision making that will combine: (i) a procedural model of the decision in each trial, and (ii) a latent variable model of biasing influence on decision-making resulting from past trial history. The computational models will make it possible to identify neuronal activity that represents task-relevant variables and the dynamic flow of information across the different elements of the identified neural circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when we hear the first sound in 'toe' and in 'tall', we must identify them as two instances of the same sound, /t/, that are distinct from other sounds such as /d/ at the beginning of 'doe'. This is a remarkable feat given that each speech sound is characterized by a host of acoustic properties. Thus, one question that has interested researchers in speech perception is how listeners decide what acoustic properties to pay attention to and what acoustic properties to ignore. Listeners may learn this purely based on experience. That is, based on exposure to the speech sounds in their native language, they come to know that the difference between /t/ vs /d/ is signaled by a specific set of acoustic properties that are most informative to the contrast. Listeners may also attend to cues based on the relationship the cues have with each other. For example, if two cues are perceptually inseparable, then attending to one means necessarily attending to the other.This dissertation research may lead to insights in how to improve second language instruction and may inform work for technologies on speech synthesis in minority languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand how listener's language experience and the inherent relation between acoustic properties affect speech perception. With perception experiments the researchers propose to compare how listeners use two pairs of acoustic properties when categorizing speech sounds. One pair has been shown to be perceptually inseparable, and another pair is perceptually independent. Two groups of listeners will be tested: English listeners who have no language experience with either pair of properties, and Hani (Tibeto-Burman - Yunnan, China) listeners who have language experience with both pairs of properties. Manipulating experience as well as the relation between pairs will enable the researchers to disambiguate the role of experience from that of perceptual separability. Additionally, as part of the proposed project an undergraduate student will be trained in linguistic fieldwork and experimental research methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interdisciplinary approach combines cognitive and visual neuroscience methods, aimed towards understanding how the human brain processes spatial navigation information. The studies incorporate behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimaging techniques to examine how the human brain codes for distance, heading direction, speed, and time, which may contribute to higher-level navigation mechanisms, such as planning a route to a known destination or finding one's way home. The results have the potential to impact other fields, including robotics and spatial sciences.  In robotics, autonomous systems have difficulty determining whether they have successfully returned back to their origin after an outbound journey, which robotics researchers call the loop closure problem.  In contrast, humans and animals can readily solve this problem.  Understanding how visual information is used to localize and orient will provide knowledge that could potentially facilitate innovation in mobile robots and self-driving cars or training for more efficient navigation in humans.  Greater knowledge of the basic properties of navigation in humans could also lead to improved electronic navigation systems, emergency response training, and more effective transportation signage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals harness the strengths of cognitive neuroscience, visual neuroscience, and spatial sciences to examine navigation in humans.  While much is known about the navigation system in rodents, the rat and primate have fundamentally different visual systems. Contributions from the visual system provide critical information necessary for self-motion guided navigation, and the theoretical basis for this proposal stems from computational models that posit that perceptual information, including optic flow, speed, and direction signals, are necessary for successful navigation. The researchers propose a framework in which spatial representations transform from a retinotopic to a spatiotopic organization. This framework posits testable hypotheses about the nature of self-motion guided navigational representations in the brain. A series of experiments will examine how the human brain codes lower-level representations, such as distance, heading direction, speed, and time, which may serve as basis functions for generating higher-level level navigational representations. The studies will examine how these selective properties are spatially organized in the brain, as well as the higher-level computations that bring this information together to compute path integration. To do so, the proposed studies employ innovative functional MRI paradigms adapted from visual neuroscience, including population receptive-field mapping, phase-encoded analyses, and model-based time-series analyses.

Research shows that IPV affects young adults at rates higher than other age groups. It is also associated with many negative outcomes, including psychological distress and school drop-out. The costs to society and to individuals is enormous. Among all people who experience IPV, sexual minorities show rates higher than heterosexual individuals. Higher rates of IPV among individuals in this minority group can be explained by the concept of sexual stigma, that is negative attitudes and discrimination directed toward this group. This project develops a model of stigma that identifies two distinct forms: institutional stigma and individual stigma. Institutional stigma refers to the discriminatory practices and policies of an organization or institution. Individual stigma refers to experiencing prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behavior from other people, as well as accepting negative beliefs about this minority group as true. Young adults attending a wide variety of colleges and universities will be surveyed to learn how attending a college that is less supportive toward this minority group (institutional stigma) can lead to feelings of shame and fears of being discriminated against (individual stigma). This project examines the extent to which these stigma experiences increase risk for IPV in this group, and considers multiple pathways for such increased risk, including lower levels of social support, increased drinking, difficulties with managing emotions, and increases in depression. The alarming rates of IPV in this group on college campuses makes it a high public health priority to identify factors that contribute to these increased rates and to ultimately develop effective prevention efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and tests the multi-level sexual stigma model of intimate partner violence (MLSSM-IPV). A longitudinal survey will be conducted of over 20,000 sexual minority and heterosexual students and more than 7,500 faculty, staff, and administrators across 15 large residential colleges and universities. The institutions will vary in the extent to which they have made efforts to establish a supportive climate for students in the minority group. Several hypotheses derived from the MLSSM-IPV model will be tested. One is that universities with higher levels of institutional sexual stigma (as evidenced by discriminatory practices and policies) will have higher rates of individual-level stigma (prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors) among heterosexual staff, faculty, administrators and students, and also higher rates of IPV victimization and perpetration among minority group members. A second hypothesis is that individual-level stigma among this minority group (feelings of shame regarding one's identity, anticipating discrimination from others) will be predicted by both institutional stigma and by individual level-stigma among heterosexual staff, faculty, administrators and students. It is expected that the relationship between stigma and IPV experiences in the minority group will be mediated by emotion regulation difficulties, poor social support, hazardous drinking, and psychological distress. A 6-month follow-up survey with students will examine how stigma and mediators predict IPV experiences. This research will establish the extent to which stigma at the institutional and individual levels relates to increased risk of IPV, and identify mechanisms by which this occurs. The project is an important step in developing comprehensive and effective approaches to the prevention of intimate partner violence associated with a key vulnerable population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first concerns the sample selection problem in which data are not representative of the population of interest. Not dealing with this problem can lead to incorrect conclusions. The investigator provides a better understanding of this problem and develops methods to avoid strong assumptions that are typically imposed by traditional approaches. The second topic is related to panel data that contain a large number of individuals or firms with more than one-time period. The investigator examines more general versions of existing nonlinear models for panel data by asking whether it is possible to exactly learn the object of interest even with infinite amounts of data. If the answer is negative, this project further constructs bounds for the parameters of interest. The third topic is concerned with how researchers calculate the statistical uncertainty associated with the analysis of a data set. The investigator develops tools that can be used when existing tools are computationally infeasible, as opposed to tools that are better from a theoretical point of view. The tools developed in this research can be used in many areas of economics and social sciences. To facilitate this, the investigator also produces computer programs for other researchers to utilize in their own work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops new tools and insights that will be useful to empirical microeconomists.

To estimate sample selection models, previous studies often assumed exclusion restrictions, in that some variables influence the selection into the sample, but do not have an effect on the outcome of interest. This project provides a better understanding of this issue and develops methods to alleviate it. The second part of the project investigates panel data. The investigator focuses on models where the variable of interest is binary and investigates the extent to which it is possible to estimate the parameters of such models.

Linguists have long been aware that speakers' awareness of what information is available in the broad context of utterance affects how they use and interpret language, but the exact effects of this knowledge on certain parts of the linguistic system have not been fully identified. The constructions under investigation in this dissertation are verb phrase ellipsis, in which a silent ""gap"" after an auxiliary verb is interpreted as containing full verbal content, and deaccenting, in which the pronunciation of a sentential constituent is de-emphasized to indicate that it is redundant. Previous analyses have suggested that both phenomena are licit only when they can be construed as identical to an overt antecedent that appears earlier in the linguistic discourse. This dissertation investigates evidence that previous formulations of identity for these phenomena have been too strict, and that they can be licensed and interpreted with respect to a broader range of linguistic antecedents, as well as with respect to information available in the nonlinguistic context. In addition to advancing the scientific understanding of these phenomena, this research may have technological and clinical applications. A more complete understanding of how listeners integrate linguistic and nonlinguistic information to interpret these constructions may lead to the development of artificial language systems that produce and interpret language more similarly to human speakers, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies for speakers whose use of these constructions is impaired.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The dissertation project focuses on three main research questions: (1) Is salient information from the nonlinguistic context considered during the interpretation of verb phrase ellipsis when there is a linguistic antecedent that could provide a reasonable interpretation? (2) Can deaccenting of a particular constituent be licensed by linguistic relations other than repetition, i.e., entailment, bridging, or world knowledge inferences? (3) Can deaccenting be licensed, in whole or in part, by information made salient in the nonlinguistic context? The two phenomena will be investigated using production, perception, and eye-tracking methodologies that examine the use and interpretation of verb phrase ellipsis and deaccenting both offline and in real time. The results will enhance models of how these constructions are licensed and interpreted in a more comprehensive discourse context than has previously been considered, by taking into account linguistically evoked information, inferrable information, and salient nonlinguistic information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on the Late Neolithic prehistoric period (roughly 7,000-6,500 years ago) on the Great Hungarian Plain, but its findings have direct relevance to contemporary issues of social interaction, boundaries, and the definition and demarcation of borders. Previous studies on these issues have focused on how regional cultural variation is shaped by environmental and economic changes, but these studies underestimate the active role that people play in the creation of their own social identities. By focusing on household-scale interactions, the project will examine how daily interactions between people influence larger regional socio-cultural boundaries. In this way it will contribute to a better understanding of how connectivity impacts and structures concepts of self and identity - issues that are especially relevant in the extremely globalized world that exists today. From a research perspective the project will advance the well-established consortium of collaborative Hungarian-American archaeological research projects that has been active in the region for the past 40 years.

In this next phase Hungarian and American researchers will work together to investigate a Herply tell site, Csokmo-Kaposztas Domb, that is located near the perceived Herpalay and Tisza cultural boundary. Preliminary magnetometric survey at the site identified subsurface features, including houses, fortification ditches, wells, and storage pits. Guided by the magnetometric and surface survey data, the team will excavate selected households and collect materials that will grant insight into past interactive behaviors, including the ceramics that people made, the tools that they used, and the food that they ate. From these materials, the team will be able to reconstruct past interactions at multiple scales and determine the degree of connectivity between households within the settlement of Caokmo-Kaposztas Domb. Innovative techniques, including laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), portable X-ray fluorescence (p-XRF) and social network analysis (SNA) will be used to model these multi-scalar interactions. The results from the survey and excavation will be compared with information from neighboring excavated Tisza sites that were previously excavated in order to assess how inter-site interactions and access to exchange networks at the household level resulted in the formation and maintenance of regional cultural boundaries during the Late Neolithic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intelligent machines can use massive data to learn to identify patterns that are similar to learned examples, but people can use very small amounts of data to discover deep similarities between situations that are superficially very different (e.g., engineers have devised a cooling system for buildings using principles adapted from termite mounds). This type of creative thinking depends on analogy: the ability to find and exploit resemblances based on relations among entities, rather than solely on superficial appearances. The present investigation aims to show how relations can be learned from examples (in the form of either texts or pictures) and then used to reason by analogy. The work integrates recent advances in machine learning with more human-like learning mechanisms. Improved analogy models will increase the power of computer-based information retrieval, allowing both text and pictures to serve as retrieval cues to search large databases for items that are analogous in relational structure. The large analogy datasets generated for the project will be made publically available. More flexible search engines will help to automate creative tasks such as engineering design. Identifying the computational basis for relation learning and analogical reasoning will guide development of artificial intelligence systems by providing more efficient learning mechanisms. The research team is integrating research and education activities by using this project as a training opportunity in interdisciplinary research, encompassing psychology, statistics, computer science and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will integrate advanced computational approaches with behavioral experiments on human relation learning and analogical reasoning, using both texts and pictures as inputs. The work is guided by cognitive theory on learning and reasoning, and exploits recent advances in the field of machine vision. The project includes the creation and validation of multiple databases of analogy problems. Experiments will be performed to establish human performance levels in a variety of tasks. Computational models will be developed by synergizing big-data learning through deep networks with small-data learning through Bayesian modeling. Models will be evaluated by comparison with human benchmarks. By addressing issues that arise in reasoning from natural inputs such as texts and pictures, the models to be developed will generalize to situations that people encounter in their daily life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cannot detain all 1.8 million immigrants simultaneously, mostly because ICE's budget only funds 34,000 detention beds on a given day. Therefore, immigrants who do not qualify for mandatory detention are enrolled in the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), which enforces the use of a Global Position System (GPS) ankle monitor. We know that some U.S. immigration policies are associated with immigrant ill health, but scant research exists on how being visually marked and placed under constant surveillance affects physical and mental health as well as health care access. This research will show the impact of the GPS ankle monitoring on the mental and physical health of immigrants.  Project findings will help inform immigration and public health policies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the U.S. today, immigrants who do not qualify for mandatory detention are enrolled in Alternative to Detention Programs (ATDP) and must wear a GPS ankle monitor. The project uses ethnographic observations in multiple settings and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with immigrants wearing the GPS ankle monitor. Although these people are no longer in detention, they are still under surveillance via the ankle monitors. The project will document the social, material, mental, and physical effects of the GPS ankle monitors, such as anxiety and difficulty finding housing. This research project makes a theoretical contribution to studies of Latino immigrant populations, while also documenting the effects of surveillance on individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ancient Maya urbanism is characterized by large low-density cities covering up to two hundred square kilometers; some had populations of up to (and sometimes over) 100,000 people; all had a reliance on seasonal tropical rainfall for both agriculture and subsistence. While Maya rulers, mostly known from texts recorded on stone monument, reigned over Classic Period (550 CE - 900 CE) Maya cities and states, court officials and support staff likely handled day-to-day administrative tasks within these cities. The ancient Maya provide an excellent case study to review the role that both top-down (elite) and bottom-up (household) processes can impact the day-to-day governance of ancient cities. This research incorporates excavation at the Maya city of Caracol, Belize, one of the most well documented Maya cities, with data analyses to determine governance patterns. Maya cities, like Caracol, were designed to harvest rainfall for both sustenance and agriculture, but these aspects alone did not provide for the longevity of these ancient cities. Caracol itself also thrived for over one thousand years because of its social and political organization. Additional understanding of governance at Caracol will help elucidate how this city functioned, shed light on its longevity, and provide data appropriate for theoretical formulations and cross-cultural comparisons. Research at Caracol also involves cooperation between United States and Belizean citizens, as well as building and reinforcing positive international ties between both countries on a variety of levels that include hands-on undergraduate archaeological training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, Adrian Chase assesses the degree to which aspects of the physical layout of a city (including the location of infrastructure, standardization of residential features, and neighborhood identity) provide practical proxies for identifying governance with Caracol, Belize as the test site location. Three datasets are used: 1) the distribution of urban service facility features around the city as a proxy for the degree of infrastructural power; 2) the degree of standardization of garden city features as a proxy for residential autonomy; and, 3) the patterning and distribution of ritual artifacts and their correlation with proposed neighborhoods as a proxy for the potential for collective action through neighborhood level identity. Through this research, concepts from more general urban theory in a variety of disciplines will be integrated with archaeological research through the operationalization of infrastructural power, household autonomy, and collective action at multiple scales of analysis: citywide, district, neighborhood, and plazuela household. Analysis of the built environment and archaeological material will augment the hieroglyphic narrative and provide a better understanding of the governance of a Late Classic Period Maya city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They engage and inspire millions of Americans through exhibits and programs, serving as an important educational resource for communicating knowledge to a wide audience. The objects: artifacts, art work, film and photography - that museums preserve also constitute an invaluable scientific record of cultural practices, past and present. They are a databank of physical and visual material that can be examined, analyzed, and reassessed again and again as questions and methods change over time. Objects document dynamic aspects of cultural behavior that are not recorded in written sources; they are one of the few ways to gain information directly from past societies that did not have writing. However, these collections are not being used to their full potential. Many interested researchers cannot effectively utilize museum collections because they lack the skills and methods to approach or evaluate this type of data, which presents distinct challenges. There are few graduate-level courses in museum-based research in the United States. Few of these programs can offer the hands-on learning that is essential for the study of collections. Students wishing to tap into the research potential of American museums either have had to study abroad or to train themselves. The result is that we are not fully capitalizing on the investment the nation has made in the assembly and maintenance of museum collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA) was created in response to this need. Based in the Smithsonian Institution's Department of Anthropology, it is an intensive four-week residential program providing training in museum research methods. Each year it accepts 12 graduate students from across the country who show promise to contribute to development of the field of cultural anthropology through object research. It also accepts two faculty fellows who come to learn how to teach with collections at their home institution. SIMA is a rigorous program that includes a mix of formal class time, individual research work, and extensive mentoring. Support from the National Science Foundation covers student and faculty fellows participant costs and the bringing together of a specialized faculty of visiting experts with Smithsonian scholars whose time is contributed to SIMA. The Smithsonian offers its extensive collections as a laboratory for learning, giving students an opportunity for in-depth work with one of the greatest anthropological research collections in the world. Over the period of 2009 to 2017, SIMA has provided training for 103 students, 34 collection interns and 7 university professors, and engaged 18 academics as guest faculty from 66 universities and 22 states. SIMA has a solid model in place for training, and former student participants are gaining university positions where they are using SIMA as a model for their own teaching. This grant will broaden the scope of the SIMA model by (1) expanding the type of collections examined with a particular focus on film and photography, (2) expanding the methods taught to understand the range of materials encountered in collections (Ancient DNA, flora and fauna), and (3) by recruiting and training a more diverse set of students and faculty. The goal of all these activities is to create a new generation of American scholars who are able to use anthropological collections effectively in their research. These new scholars will revitalize museums as sites where knowledge is produced as well as disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The answer to this question is unclear. For example, some research has suggested that meditation changes human attention and alters the body's immune response, blood pressure, and other physiological markers. Other research has found that active church going may improve one's health. Weekly church attendance has been found in some studies to add two years on average to the length of the congregant's life. However, critics point out that the reported improved health could result simply from relaxation (in the case of meditation) and social support (in the case of church going), and have nothing to do with the religious contexts in which these practices take place. To help resolve this debate, anthropologist Tanya Marie Luhrmann will use scientific measures to examine the effects of religion-based training on cognitive performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Luhrmann and her team will focus on one group of religious practitioners who train for intensive prayer practice. The researchers will collect data from this population by combining intensive and repeated interviewing with a neuroscience evaluation using a tested EEG neurophysiological protocol. They will collect data from both highly experienced practitioners and novices to see whether those who are more experienced perform differently. Findings from the research will help health researchers better understand if there is a neurophysiological basis to reported experiences of mental cultivation and whether training affects these experiences.

Mass violence takes many forms: family massacres, terrorist attacks, shootings related to other crimes (like robbery), gang violence, and other incidents in which offenders attack targeted individuals and/or random strangers. The phenomenon of indiscriminate mass public violence, often directed at strangers, particularly has generated the most public alarm in recent years. Mass public attacks appear to have increased in regularity and severity, leading to a heightened sense of national fear in our communities, schools and colleges, and so on. While such events are seemingly random, they are likely not, and therefore possibly preventable in many instances. Indeed, these events are linked by numerous themes: mental illness, domestic violence, grudges, bigotry, political polarization, copycat behaviors, and the rise and more open behavior of fringe groups, to name a few. Mass violence has become an urgent problem that needs an updated and contemporary research evidence-base, translation activities to turn that research into effective interventions, and improved social services to ensure the interventions are implemented well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the two day conference will be to: 1) review research that has been conducted on mass violence; 2) determine points of consensus in the available research; 3) identify gaps in research knowledge and points of substantial disagreement; 4) identify policy implications stemming from established research knowledge; and 5) develop research recommendations to address knowledge gaps and controversies in the field.

Previous scholarship emphasized rich burial evidence as the primary means for understanding broader scale social processes. In contrast, this program of research will identify how populations were organized across the landscape at regional and local community scales and how these trends changed through time. This will be one of the first major studies to use regional scale survey and data analysis of spatial patterning and demographic dynamics in the Republic of Serbia. This research, therefore, provides a crucial opportunity for important academic exchange in methods and theory with Serbian academic institutions and in training students who will have the opportunity to participate in new developments in archaeological research design, field methods and data analysis. At completion, the study will provide an important new comparative case study, available as an open source dataset, on late prehistoric European societies that indexes the emergence of new forms of social, economic and political organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to anthropological studies of social, economic and political processes in a way seldom utilized for this region and produce and interpret datasets at multiple scales (household, settlement and regional) allowing for a more robust and empirically supported model of diachronic social change. This will contribute to regional scholarship but also to broader studies on trajectories of developing social complexity in early human societies. Archaeological field research will be undertaken in the Banat region of Northern Serbia, located in the Carpathian Basin of Europe, where it appears that egalitarian communities gave way to completely new forms of hierarchical social organization by the early second millennium BCE. Research questions include: (1) What is the spatial and demographic scale of late prehistoric communities and how does this change over time? (2) Can settlements be identified with evidence of centralization of resources, craft production, and supra local exchange? (3) Do such settlements exhibit substantial demographic growth or are populations still dispersed in smaller farmsteads at the local and regional scales? (4) Is there evidence of settlement enclosure and fortification and how does this co-vary with more centralized sites? (5) Does regional scale settlement patterning indicate settlement proximity to important natural resources and regional river waterways associated with long-distance exchange? Planned fieldwork activities include: (i) a regional scale pedestrian survey of 80 sq. km, (ii) surface collection of artifacts and statistical analysis, (iii) targeted near surface geophysical surveys (soil magnetic susceptibility and fluxgate gradiometry), (iv) targeted test pit excavations and, (v) spatial analysis of topographic, environmental and survey data using ArcGIS software.

This project will investigate the local interactions between individuals in a crowd that trigger collective motion and whether the same mechanisms yield collective decisions, such as which 'leaders' to follow.  The results will contribute to a mathematical model of pedestrian and crowd behavior, with the aim of explaining and predicting crowd dynamics in real-world environments.  An interactive crowd simulator will be posted on the Web.  The research has many societal benefits, including applications to evacuation planning, safe building design, real-time monitoring and forecasting of crowd disasters, and the design of social robots. The results will also contribute to research on evacuation behavior and navigation systems for the blind. Moreover, an understanding of human behavior in virtual environments has implications for the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, one of NSF's 'Big Ideas,' as well as for the design of immersive social media.  The project will also contribute to educating the next generation of scientists by training undergraduate and graduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, in experimental research and the use of virtual reality technology and computational modeling methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is generally believed that collective behavior emerges from local interactions between individuals.  Thus, the key to explaining collective motion lies in understanding the rules of engagement that govern these interactions and the neighborhood of interaction over which they operate. There are many different models of collective motion and collective decision-making in fields as disparate as mathematical biology, computer animation, physics, and robotics. However, few of them are based on experimental evidence about the rules that actually govern local interactions and how they generate global patterns of collective motion.  This project tests whether competing models can explain (a) the onset and propagation of collective motion, the crux of self-organization, and (b) collective decision-making by a crowd, such as whether to turn right or left or which subgroup to follow.  In particular, the research will determine the role of leadership in collective decisions and whether strategically positioned leaders can control a crowd's motion.  Researchers will answer these questions using a combination of experiments on 1) a human participant walking in a virtual crowd to decipher the local recruitment and decision rules; 2) agent-based simulations of the data to test competing models; 3) analysis of real crowd data using methods of network reconstruction to determine the causal networks in a crowd; and 4) use of pinning control to predict the influence of leaders (confederates) in real crowd experiments, using large-scale motion capture techniques.  The result of this project will be an empirically-grounded model that accounts for the self-organization of collective motion and the emergence of collective decisions in human crowds, a significant step toward a general kinetic theory of collective behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems participated in co-funding this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include ratings surveys found on sites like Amazon and Yelp, large corporation customer satisfaction/net promoter surveys, and the aggregation of medical history records. Current classification methods are inadequate for analyzing large ordinal datasets. The investigators will develop a classification method that facilitates the analysis of large ordinal datasets across a spectrum of application domains.

As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation research will develop a highly scalable ordinal classification method that can be applied to both structured and unstructured (e.g., images and text) ordinal data.  A core component of the method is a loss function that called Ordinal Hyperplane Loss (OHPL). OHPL is particularly designed for data with ordinal classes and enables deep learning techniques to be applied to the ordinal classification problems. By minimizing OHPL, a deep neural network learns to map data to an optimal space where the distance between points and their class centroid hyper-plane are minimized while a nontrivial ordinal relationship among classes are maintained. Preliminary experimental results indicate that deep neural network with OHPL optimizing significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives on classification accuracies across multiple datasets. This research will examine strategies that scale the OHPL based learning to big ordinal data. The investigators will apply the OHPL-based learning to real-life critical applications such as determining the severity/stages of a disease.

Face perception plays a central role in interactions among people.  The ability to recognize faces and interpret expressions can vary greatly in healthy adults.  Efficient face perception develops slowly through childhood and into early adulthood.  Face perception is much more efficient for familiar individuals with whom we interact frequently.  We will use new, state-of-the-art methods for modeling the brain's system for face perception.  The model has interacting processing pathways.  Each pathway serves a different function.   These include recognition of identity, interpretation of expression, and activation of social knowledge.  We study individual differences using a new approach, called hyperalignment. Hyperalignment allows us to see how information is encoded in fine-scale brain patterns.  These studies can make it possible to address questions about the effects of development, education, culture, and clinical disorder on brain organization.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate individual variation in the human cortical functional architecture for face perception that leverages our previous work on multivariate models of information in the distributed neural system for face perception and our work creating hyperalignment to build high-dimensional common models of information spaces in cortex. Our approach discovers shared basis functions for information that is encoded in fine-scale cortical topographies, affording reliable measurement of individual differences in the representation of this detailed information.  We will investigate individual variation in cortical systems for face perception as a function of cognitive ability, development, and learning, and build the common model of cortical information spaces using fMRI data collected during viewing of naturalistic movies and in the resting state.  We will use response hyperalignment and connectivity hyperalignment to derive a common model of the face perception system with shared basis functions for fine-scale variation in response tuning and functional connectivity. By modeling shared neural representation at a fine scale, measures of deviations from shared representation are more sensitive to the inter-individual variation that underlies differences in cognitive function.  Our methods have the potential to provide a firmer and more nuanced basis for addressing questions about the effects of development, education, culture, and clinical disorder on brain organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the use of solar, wind, and biomass technologies to provide electricity both on and off national grids is escalating worldwide. Energy access and use is not just a technological issue but also a social one, creating opportunities and risks related to connection and production. While there has been significant research on the social effects of carbon-based energy production and use, we know less about the specific ways alternative forms of energy transform peoples' lives, create new opportunities or risk, and affect relationships between individuals and communities. Understanding how alternative forms of energy are perceived and used at the household level, especially by those who may not have access to traditional forms of electrification, is a crucial part of assessing whether and how alternative energy sources can contribute to a more comprehensive and secure portfolio of energy options. Findings from this research will illuminate the ways alternative energy technologies are incorporated into daily life and to what effect, and will inform national and international energy policies that can be targeted toward meeting the needs of the most marginalized members of society. The project also provides training for students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis; broadens participation in the sciences through the training of students and researchers from underrepresented groups; and it improves scientific infrastructure through international scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kristin Phillips of Emory University and Dr. Erin Dean of the New College of Florida will explore the question of whether the benefits and risks associated with the adoption of new energy technologies are socioeconomically differentiated. This research will examine the impact of solar, wind, and biomass energy technologies on the everyday lives of people in the East African nation of Tanzania. Tanzania is a particularly appropriate place for such a study because the state's pursuit of traditional carbon energy development has been coupled with a notable rise in alternative, renewable energy investment by public and private sources. It provides an appropriate laboratory for investigating energy consumption at the household level, where 90% of energy consumption takes place). The researchers have each worked for over a decade in Tanzania, and their in-country research background is geographically diverse, providing the opportunity to consider different approaches to energy use in rural, urban, peri-urban, and island contexts. Because the existing literature tends to overlook the role of women in energy production and consumption, gendered energy labor and use is an important focus of this research. With gender and geographic range in mind, the core of the research for this project will be conducted through critical case studies in domestic settings in three diverse sites. The researchers will use purposive sampling to identify socioeconomically diverse households who are using a range of energy technologies. Using the methods of observation, interviews, and focus groups, they will investigate the socioeconomic dimensions of renewable energy development.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Christine Drea at Duke University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of oxytocin (OT) in primate behavior. This project uses an animal model, a genus of Malagasy lemurs housed at the Duke Lemur Center. Species within this genus (Eulemur) vary considerably in their social systems, including the degree of female dominance and existence of monogamous mating bonds. Thus, Eulemur is a natural experiment that permits an investigation of how OT is involved in the complex nature of pair bonds. Insights from this project will inform the literature across several scientific fields, including zoology, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience. More broadly, findings from this project have the potential to inform efforts to harness OT for therapeutic purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functional significance of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has become a topic of debate within social endocrinology. Evolutionary biologists have argued that ancestral functions for OT were co-opted in some species to mediate formation and maintenance of other social bonds. A large literature supports and espouses OT's potential as a biological foundation for the interdependent relationships, including monogamous pair-bonds, characteristic of highly social species. Psychological studies report a number of both prosocial and anti-social effects or correlates of OT. Functional interpretations are often derived from model systems of a single species. Evolutionary biologists argue that model systems do not sufficiently represent the diversity of mammalian socio-ecologies. This project expands the current state of knowledge in behavioral OT research by collecting behavioral, hormonal, and anatomical data on the OT system in a unique animal model - Eulemur, a genus of group-living primates. The combination of close genetic relatedness and divergent social behavior within the Eulemur genus acts as a natural experiment. Seminal studies revealed that inter-species differences in structure and function of the OT system are essential to understanding the biological bases of mating system variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether on the basis of gender, ethnicity, age or other markers, group-based differences in how people treat others are known to arise even when social group information is irrelevant and even when people explicitly reject social stereotypes. Despite progress in documenting these disparities, much remains unknown about their origins. The current research focuses on the role of individual human decision-making in producing societal-level outcomes. Specifically, the investigators aim to leverage complementary strengths of behavioral economics, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to uncover systematic patterns of individual human decision-making that, in aggregate, contribute to societal treatment disparities. The primary goal is to characterize the origins of unequal treatment with sufficient precision to support accurate, context-specific predictions of how people will treat members of different social groups. Support for this collaborative effort broadens access to training opportunities for aspiring scientists, provides opportunities for scientific outreach to local communities, and ultimately contributes scientific understanding of societal disparities, with implications for efforts to measure and address discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial progress has been made in documenting the existence of treatment disparities in the world. Separately, substantial progress has been made in in understanding how people think about different social groups in the laboratory. However, given the multitude of ways in which people can be categorized, and the complexity of factors influencing people's social behavior, it has been challenging to construct models of social thought and behavior that are capable of linking laboratory insights to field observations. The current research aims to connect these efforts to produce accurate predictions about when and how members of particular groups will be (dis)advantaged. Specifically, building upon evidence from cognitive neuroscience that valuation and social cognition engage separable but interacting systems, the research uses computational modeling to formally integrate psychological frameworks of how people see others (social perception) with behavioral economic accounts of how people value others' outcomes (social valuation). It then uses those models to predict how people will treat members of different social groups in laboratory and field settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each cohort will be assessed at three time points -- every six months for infants (i.e., 8, 14, and 20 months), every 8 months for toddlers (i.e., 20, 28, and 36 months), and every year for preschoolers (3, 4, and 5 years). When examined at a specific age, the sample will provide a snapshot into the association between mental rotation and non-spatial skills (i.e., object features, processing bias, and motor experience). The longitudinal design will allow the investigators to follow participants across infancy, toddlerhood, or the preschool years. This approach provides an opportunity to understand how non-spatial skills, such as more precocious motor skills during infancy, may shape mental rotation over time. Such findings are central to bolstering understanding of the possible mechanisms by which particular types of experiences can promote infants' mental rotation. This, consequently, has implications for promoting academic achievement and remediating existing discrepancies in spatial and mathematical skills in children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Music forms an important part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and it is one of the few universals shared by all known human cultures. Yet its utility and potential evolutionary advantages remain a mystery. This project will test the hypothesis that early musical exposure has benefits that extend beyond music to critical aspects of human communication, such as speech perception in noise. In addition, the investigators will test whether early musical training is associated with less severe effects of aging on the ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. Degraded ability to understand speech in noise is a common complaint among older listeners and hearing loss has been shown to be associated with social isolation and more rapid cognitive and health declines. If formal musical training is shown to affect improved perception and speech communication in later life, the outcomes could have a potentially major impact on quality of life,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier studies have suggested relationships between early musical training and improved auditory neural processing and perception, but the studies' impact has been limited by small sample numbers and inconsistent methods between different studies. This project will test a large number of participants (N=360) with uniform recruitment criteria and testing protocols across six different sites. Measures will include the neural frequency following response (FFR) to speech sounds, behavioral frequency selectivity, speech perception in noise, speech perception against a background of competing talkers, pitch discrimination, and auditory masking. The participants will also complete other assessments, including a personality inventory questionnaire, a profile of musical perception skills, a spatial reasoning test to assess general cognitive ability, as well as a background questionnaire to determine socio-economic status, education, and musical background. Participants will be selected to span a wide range of ages and musical experience. The neural data and the speech perception measures will be related to factors of musical training, such as the number of years of musical training and the age at which musical training began.

Earlier studies on this topic have emphasized the role of political economy and control of resources and production, coercive actions or sponsorship of public events. Kinship connections and cooperative behaviors were downplayed. The resultant models accordingly stressed the strongly centralized and hierarchical character of sociopolitical organization. Archaeology, particularly in collaboration with complementary fields, is well placed to illuminate factors and processes that promote stable and effective sociopolitical integration, a topic that has been a pervasive concern for studies of complex societies past and present. In contrast to previous studies, this research highlights instead the importance of kinship or the degree and nature of genetic affinity to the real or fictional ancestors and shared religious beliefs and rituals, thereby significantly broadening the perspective on factors and hierarchical and non-hierarchical means of achieving such integration. Not only does this research promote international and interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration, but also American and Peruvian student and postdoctorate training. In addition, it will enrich the public display at the Sican National Museum that represents an effective sharing of research results with both Peruvian and the non-Peruvian public. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Monumental architecture built by many complex societies past and present serves as an impressive, durable symbolic marker of power, prestige and identity of associated groups. What then do multiple coexistent monuments built close in time and space at a single location signify about group(s) that built them? This question guides the field research in the Lambayeque region on the north coast of Peru by Dr. Shimada and his team. Taking advantage of the fact that monuments at the 1000-year old Sican capital have closely associated cemeteries, the investigators will excavate burials that have been located in previous seasons of fieldwork and carry out multiple detailed analyses of human skeletons, ceramic, metal and other funerary objects as well as their associated styles and images. Results from skeletal analysis, including ancient DNA, signs of developmental health, and statistical analysis of numerous measurements taken on teeth will illuminate genealogical relationships and life style of individuals being compared. Ratios of carbon, nitrogen and strontium isotopes defined from skeletal samples will in turn inform on dietary composition and geographic origins of the same individuals. In addition, determination of choices of techniques, styles, images, and/or raw materials used in manufacturing of funerary objects further aid in distinguishing artisans and larger groups to which they pertain.  Employing the above multi-disciplinary methodology, the research team will test three competing hypotheses regarding the importance of kinship and shared religious beliefs. Test results will be integrated into an expanding, regional funerary, DNA and other biological database that will serve as a referential base for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improved cookstoves are a prime example: while cleaner-burning stove technologies have potential health, environmental, and social benefits, efforts to disseminate these technologies have fallen short and the practice of cooking with biomass over open fires remains dominant throughout much of the developing world. The central aim of this proposal is to study how economic incentives (""prices""), social learning (""peers""), and subjective beliefs (""perceptions"") interact to influence technology adoption dynamics. We do so through a field experiment that offers new stoves at different price levels to groups of households with and without social ties to households that have already received stoves. Our results will inform and future efforts to disseminate welfare-enhancing technologies to larger population groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our conceptual model of households' technology adoption and use decisions highlights multiple potential interactions among prices, peers, and perceptions.  Key research questions that will be addressed through our experiments include how price affects perceived quality of a new technology, how these perceptions are modified by exposure to peers that have experience with the technology, and how perceptions change over time based on one's own experience and (objective and subjective) technology performance. We implement a novel identification strategy for identifying these effects, using the preexisting and exogenously controlled distribution of free stoves in combination with uncorrelated, cluster-randomized assignment to different stove subsidy levels. By explicitly measuring perceptions in conjunction with other outcome variables in the experiment (including both surveys and physical indicators of stove use and impacts on personal exposure to pollutants), the researchers will be able to test specific models about how prices and peers (prior adoption interact in belief formation) a key issue in the technology adoption literature."

Forensic scientists are required to use a standardized set of categories when determining how a person dies, however, many forms of death are uncertain or occur in situations that challenge official categories. As a result, forensic scientists must often relate causes of death in ways that defy the actual nature of the death under investigation. This process shapes related social outcomes, such as the nature of potential criminal investigations and insurance claims and can lead the justice system to function in ways that obfuscate the collection of valid scientific knowledge. Understanding how manner of death categories are constructed and how they might be changed could lead to more accurate conceptions of death categories, particularly for socially vulnerable categories of people, and a to improvements in the justice system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-method investigation of 'manner of death' categories as they are employed in forensic science, and how these matter for jointly shaping science, medicine, and the criminal justice system. Data come from documentary analyses of policy documents at the federal, state, and local levels, and of forensic science textbooks. These will be complemented by ethnographic observations and interviews at forensic science departments, and at the offices of coroners and medical examines. The main goal of the project is to show how academic research practices and seemingly mundane forms of scientific typologies and categorizations affect legal practices and the effective functioning of the criminal justice system. In doing so, it helps build on existing scholarship in science studies indicating that science and technology not only assist in resolving legal disputes, but can also actively produce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The appearance of modified stone tools in the fossil record represents a potential adaptive shift in the human lineage as ancestors accessed nutrient-dense foods, established flexible niches, and began to alter environments through cumulative technology and shape the selective pressures within them. Understanding the origin and transmission of early tool technology is of inherent interest to the evolution of the human lineage. What were the behavioral strategies of early toolmakers? How much energy did toolmakers invest in producing stone artifacts? How did tool behaviors change through evolutionary time? Dr. Tom Plummer and PhD candidate Emma Finestone, of the City University of New York, will conduct a regional study investigating the earliest persistent stone tool industry - termed the Oldowan - across time scales. Oldowan tools vary in size, shape, degree of reduction, and stone raw material type and these properties are thought to reflect behavioral, cognitive, and dietary changes in the human lineage that are often linked to known trends in anatomical and energetic evolution, including an increase in body mass and metabolic rate. This investigation of trends in the Oldowan archaeological record will expand the geographic range of the earliest Oldowan and shed light on the origins of persistent tool use in a broader evolutionary context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plummer and Finestone will undertake a project comparing stone tool reduction and raw material procurement at three Oldowan sites spanning nearly a million year interval on the Homa Peninsula in Kenya. This approach offers a snapshot into regional Oldowan behavior and allows researchers to evaluate technological strategies, mobility, and landscape use of some of the earliest toolmakers over time. Using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) geochemical analyses, elemental signatures will link raw materials used in stone tool production to nearby primary outcrops and secondary drainages. This allows researchers to identify raw material sources and determine which sources were utilized by toolmakers and which rock types were most heavily reduced. After identifying regional patterns in stone resource procurement, investigators will reconstruct ranging behavior across the three localities and evaluate if and how investment in stone transport and toolmaker mobility changed through time. This not only addresses the evolution of behavior and archaeology on the Homa Peninsula, but also informs of broader adaptive shifts in the human lineage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Networks are widely recognized across multiple disciplines as critically important for understanding how information spreads (communications), how illnesses spread (public health), how legislation is passed (political science), how norms and customs form (sociology), how companies and governments coordinate economic activities (economics &amp; geography), how people form and maintain relationships (developmental psychology), and how threats to national security can be disrupted (intelligence).  Collecting data on these types of networks is often costly and impractical, which has limited progress in answering these questions.  Rather than attempt to measure directly the interactions between people (or companies, or cells, etc.), the new methods developed in this project will measure interactions indirectly by looking at patterns of similar behavior. For example, it would be impractical to ask everyone in a large city who they talk with, but we may be able to infer that two people talk with one another if they routinely attend the same events. This project will compare several different methods for making these inferences to determine which method (if any) is the most accurate. Identifying accurate methods for indirectly measuring networks is important because it will reduce the time and economic cost of answering research questions, such as those noted above, that have scientific and societal benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inferential methods investigated in this project are known as methods of backbone extraction. Given a bipartite projection network in which two agents (e.g., people) share some artifacts in common (e.g., they attend the same events), these methods determine whether they share enough artifacts in common to warrant the inference that they are linked (e.g., they interact with each other). Methods for making such inferences differ primarily by whether they control for nothing (e.g., an unconditional threshold), for the number of artifacts each agent has (e.g., a hypergeometric threshold), or for both the number of artifacts each agent has and the number of agents each artifact has (e.g., the fixed and stochastic degree sequence models). After implementation of several existing methods in a publicly available package for the R software and evaluation of their computational complexity, their ability to accurately recover known (i.e., ground truth) networks with varying structural properties from synthetic bipartite data that contain varying amounts of noise will be compared. In addition, the performance of these methods using two publicly available benchmark empirical bipartite datasets that have known ground truths will be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As of 2016, 3% of members within the international organization of social and personality psychologists (SPSP) self-identified as Black or African-American. The underrepresentation of Black members in the field means that graduate students and early career scholars are less likely than their White peers (who comprise 63% of SPSP membership) to have role models and mentors from their racial/ethnic group, negatively impacting persistence and perceived fit within the field. BlaSPR will create opportunities for Black scholars to build community among their peers and share critical information to facilitate success. The conference features workshops on professional development and productivity, research presentations, and collaborative writing time. A core emphasis throughout each component of the conference is helping attendees network among peers and connect with senior scholars who can serve as mentors. Ultimately, this conference offers an opportunity to enhance the professional and scientific development of Black social and personality psychologists and their colleagues, ensuring a robust pipeline of scholars who will serve as role models for future scientists and create more inclusive climates in higher education and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junior scholars face many hurdles as they traverse the pipeline from undergraduate study to graduate school and beyond. Although challenges and hurdles exist for people from all backgrounds who pursue graduate study in the fields of social and personality psychology, Black scholars represent a small proportion of the field, which creates additional academic and psychological challenges and hurdles. Attributional ambiguity can raise questions about whether one's treatment is because of their race or some other factor, and the lack of mentorship and low visibility of Black senior scholars can undermine sense of fit and belonging within the field to threaten persistence. This conference intervenes to mitigate these consequences and positively impact the professional trajectories of Black social and personality psychologists. Over two and a half days, attendees will attend professional development workshops on productivity, navigating the job market, and applying for fellowships; participate in research presentations where they will give and receive critical feedback; and network with peers and senior scholars who may ultimately become research collaborators, tenure letter writers, and accountability partners. Overall, by creating a space for Black scholars to reinforce these crucial research skills and build community, the proposed conference will help broaden the participation of Black social and personality psychologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We focus on the contents of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) prepared by the US Forest Service (USFS) under the National Environmental Policy Act. Providing a more detailed picture of how scientific information is used in government decision-making will enable government agencies to improve the processes through which they incorporate scientific information. At the same time, providing details of what types of scientific information are utilized in public decision-making processes will help scientists, universities, and funding agencies prioritize science that is policy-relevant.

Here, biplanar X-ray, 3D animation, and computer simulation methods will be developed to visualize and analyze movement as individuals walk through substrates to create footprints. Direct mechanistic knowledge of foot-substrate interactions is potentially transformative for paleoanthropologists to extract anatomical and functional inferences from fossil human footprints and use these to test evolutionary hypotheses.

For instance, what proportion of arrested noncitizens are prosecuted? For what charges? What proportion are sentenced to jail or prison? Our lack of knowledge on these questions is consequential given that the majority of incarcerated non-U.S. citizens are in state prisons and immigration enforcement increasingly takes place in partnership with local criminal justice authorities. As a result, the decisions made by local police, prosecutors, and judges often determine both the criminal justice outcome and the immigration case outcome. Thus, understanding how local criminal justice actors use this discretion is fundamentally important for understanding current criminal justice practices and contemporary immigration enforcement.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of knowledge on the local criminal processing of immigrants is largely due to data constraints, in that information on foreign-born or legal status is rarely available in most state court databases. This project addresses this limitation by leveraging unique criminal history data from California and Texas - the two largest immigrant destinations in the U.S. - which tracks criminal cases from arrest through sentencing. Specifically, this project uses detailed case information on all arrests in California and Texas between 2006 and 2016 (~26 million) from the California Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) program and the Texas Computerized Criminal History System (CCH). Because both the CORI and CCH datasets include information on foreign-born status for arrestees, this project will be the first to provide even descriptive information on the case processing of immigrants in the contemporary United States.

Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both the UK's and Israel's programs entailed the creation of compulsory national biometric ID cards and databases for their own citizens. The dissertation project conceptualizes biometric data as simultaneously biological and digital sites of individual and national identity construction, and it explores how national biometric identification programs create new forms of states, citizens, and the relationships between them. The results of this project will speak to the social, political, and ethical stakes of creating technological infrastructures of personal information collection. It may serve as a useful resource for future deliberations about whether, and how, personal data should be collected and stored; in addition, it will expand conceptualizations of surveillance to include a plurality of government motivations, public concerns, and social implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses national biometric identification as a lens for probing the politics of technology, surveillance, and identity in the UK and Israel; it will explore how and why biometric identification did (or did not) become these states' preferred technique for verifying the identities of their citizens. The results of this research will contribute to STS literature on the relationship between technology and identity, the co-production of technology and forms of governance, and the relationship between the politics of technology and national politics. A key conceptual innovation of the project is its introduction and elaboration of a new concept, the ""biometricization of identity,"" which concerns the ways that people contend with the placement of the locus of individual identity onto digital, numerical representations of the human body. The project will make use of this new concept as a window for exploring a second theme, the technological and political development of the ""biometric state,"" by drawing on a key STS insight, that the ways people relate technologies to themselves also shape the ways technologies are governed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives. This dissertation project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a common human language phenomenon with fresh data and from an interactional perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project converses directly with literatures of women's health, mental health, and 20th century U.S. politics. Contributions include an examination of how maternal risk and child development literature shaped the construction of maternal mental health, a nuanced investigation of the gendered national politics of the late-20th century as they led multiple groups to accept etiologies of postpartum depression that served their own aims, and an investigation into disease construction and risk in this specifically gendered and familial disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, people can produce different acoustics for the same vowel sound, while in other cases the acoustics for two different vowels may be nearly identical. The acoustic patterns also change depending on the rate at which the sounds are spoken.  Listeners may also perceive a sound that was not actually produced due to massive reductions in speech pronunciation (e.g., the ""t"" and ""y"" sounds in ""don't you"" are often reduced to ""doncha""). Most theories assume that listeners recognize words in continuous speech by extracting consonants and vowels in a strictly sequential order. However, previous research has failed to find evidence for invariant cues in the acoustic signal that would allow listeners to extract the important information. This project uses a new tool for the study of language processing, LEXI (for Linguistic-Event EXtraction and Interpretation), to test the hypothesis that individual acoustic cues for consonants and vowels can in fact be extracted from the signal and can be used to determine the speaker's intended words. When some acoustic cues for speech sounds are modified or missing, LEXI can detect the remaining cues and evaluate them as evidence for the intended sounds and words. This research has potentially broad societal benefits, including optimization of human-machine interactions to accommodate atypical speech patterns seen in speech disorders or accented speech. This project supports training of 1-2 doctoral students and 8-10 undergraduate students through hands-on experience in experimental and computational research. All data, including code for computational models, the LEXI system, and speech databases labeled for acoustic cues will be publicly available through the Open Science Framework; preprints of all publications will be publicly available at PsyArxiv and NSF-PAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project unites signal analysis, psycholinguistic experimentation, and computational modeling to (1) survey the ways that acoustic cues vary in different contexts, (2) experimentally test how listeners use these cues through distributional learning for speech, and (3) use computational modeling to evaluate competing theories of how listeners recognize spoken words. The work will identify cue patterns in the signal that listeners use to recognize massive reductions in pronunciation and will experimentally test how listeners keep track of this systematic variation. This knowledge will be used to model how listeners ""tune in"" to the different ways speakers produce speech sounds. By using cues detected by LEXI as input to competing models of word recognition, the work provides an opportunity to examine the fine-grained time course of human speech recognition with large sets of spoken words; this is an important innovation because most cognitive models of speech do not work with speech input directly. Theoretical benefits include a strong test of the cue-based model of word recognition and the development of tools to allow virtually any model of speech recognition to work on real speech input, with practical implications for optimizing automatic speech recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many studies have shown that the ability to attend to items is highly limited; yet, it is unclear where these limits stem from and what the underlying neural mechanisms are that determine these limits. In this proposal we aim to test what constrains our ability to select information and to examine the flexibility of the human attention system across different selection demands and sensory environments. We use the human visual system as a model system to test how attention interacts with perceptual representations to guide behavior, and to examine how attention modulates neural activity to enhance perception and memory. Understanding how attention modulates these neural representations in visual cortex will help to uncover how variations in these neural patterns give rise to common perceptual and cognitive disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current research project aims to broadly understand how attention operates in different sensory environments and task contexts. We hypothesize that the capacity limits of feature-based attention are constrained by a combination of the organization of feature representations in the visual system (i.e., perceptual confusability) and by center-surround selection mechanisms. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the selection mechanisms are flexible and adjust to current task demands in terms of magnitude (enhancement and suppression) and shape (e.g., shifts in tuning curves; size of the inhibitory surround). Our approach includes psychophysics, computational modeling, and electrophysiological recordings (frequency-tagged potentials in EEG) that can tease apart perceptual factors from attentional effects, and allow to directly measure feature representations in visual cortex. Together, the proposed experiments will provide important insights into how perceptual organization and attention mechanisms interact to influence limits of attention, and will examine the flexibility of the human attention system across different task contexts. The development of novel experimental designs and neural measures to track perceptual representations in visual cortex and how they are modulated by attention will be important to test perceptual and cognitive models and how they influence visual processing more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, genetic variation from Neanderthals exists in the human gene pool, but the effects of this variation on human biology are not well understood. In this doctoral dissertation project, the researcher will conduct a large-scale laboratory-based genetic experiment to test whether Neanderthal variants can affect the degree to which a gene is active in human immune cells. By identifying these variants and making publicly available the raw data from this experiment, the researchers will advance knowledge about the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on the immune system of living humans. Given that science news often features stories about Neanderthals, the researchers will utilize popular interest in this area to demonstrate the biological and medical relevance of studying human evolutionary history. They will also work with two museums to develop an exhibit that will additionally highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will help promote women in science given that the research will largely be undertaken by a female graduate student who is committed to training other women in science and has been active in the organization for Graduate Women in Science Engineering at her university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the last two decades have seen great strides in genetic research, because the specific function of most of the human genome is still unknown, researchers face difficulty when trying to connect most specific genetic mutations to their effect on biology. To aid in this discovery, datasets have been produced that allow correlations between the presence of genetic variation and biological phenotypes. However, because genetic variants near each other are often inherited together, it can be difficult to determine which genetic variant is responsible for the biological effect, limiting the ability to truly understand the mechanism. This is especially true in the case of Neanderthal genetic sequences present in living humans, which mostly lay in poorly understood parts of the genome that are thought generally to regulate the expression of genes. Nonetheless, correlational evidence suggests that this Neanderthal genetic variation may be affecting human immune system function. The researchers will conduct an experiment in which they simultaneously test thousands of Neanderthal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in the immune system, in order to isolate the specific Neanderthal genetic variants that affect the biology of the human immune system. This will allow researchers to focus future work on specific functional testing of these important genetic variants.  Furthermore, by directly comparing correlational findings to the results in a laboratory experiment, this research will deepen the understanding of these commonly used genetic datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the PIs build on data that have been collected since 2002, analyzing large samples of candidate websites and conducting surveys of candidate campaigns. These data provide a holistic picture of a wide range of campaigns-both winners and losers-and offer scholars and citizens the ability to assess what campaigns do, why they do it, and how it might relate to subsequent governing. The intellectual merit to the project is that the data will allow scholars and citizens access to unprecedented data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ.  The broader impact is that the enhanced understanding of campaigns that these data will provide will enable practitioners to identify sources of political change and discuss reforms that could ultimately improve campaign quality.

Websites also are ideal insofar as campaigns view them as holistic portraits of messages aimed at voters. Since 2002, the PIs have coded campaign websites and conducted surveys of campaigns. The result is an unprecedented data set of campaign behavior over-time. In this project, the PIs will extend that data into the upcoming election, which is of particular interest given increased affective polarization and incivility, and the nationalization of elections.

With the recent rise of streaming video services like Netflix and Hulu, ISPs may have an incentive to use their prices to influence consumers' choices across TV and streaming video options. Important considerations for these pricing choices include: the cost differences in delivering TV and internet content, the willingness of consumers to substitute across entertainment options, and how ISPs and other firms benefit differently from different sorts of content. The investigators develop a model that take them into account. The estimated model can shed light on ISPs' pricing decisions, and can be also useful for evaluating antitrust issues in the telecommunications industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research estimates a model of demand and supply for television and internet services. The investigators have access to highly detailed data on households' choices over TV and internet subscriptions and usage, and use these data to estimate consumers' preferences across a wide variety of entertainment options, including services sold directly by ISPs (e.g. TV and internet access) and by third-party streaming services. On the supply side, this research estimates the objective functions of ISPs and content providers while accounting for potentially complex relationships among firms and differences in their cost structures, which vary with their roles in content delivery to consumers. Using the estimated model, the investigators simulate how prices will change (and how consumers and firms would be affected) under several different scenarios. For example, the introduction of source-specific discriminatory pricing (e.g. special ISP surcharges to consumers for using various streaming services) may affect consumers' demand for the full range of video options available in the market, and many prices are likely to change if ISPs can price discriminate in this way. The estimated model can be also used to study how firms' incentives to integrate or introduce new streaming services vary when firms can use sophisticated prices to curtail consumers' access to or usage of competing firms' services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will necessitate development of new engineering solutions for crafting electroencephalography (EEG) sensors that can record signal underwater, new solutions for removing noise artifacts from these highly complicated recordings, as well as careful design of experiments that could study such behaviors in a virtual-reality environment. While the brain of the octopus is very different from that of the human, it does support well-defined cognitive functions. Therefore, understanding whether and how octopuses' brains implement processes such as learning, attention, habituation, and surprise can produce new and important understandings of how neurobiological systems can support function.  This research might reveal that the neural substrates of cognitive function in the octopus are organized according to principles that differ drastically from those found in in humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project has several aims. It will develop the first underwater EEG, first testing well-validated paradigms on humans performing task underwater and benchmarking against known waveforms. The electrodes will be constructed so that they do not corrode in salt water. It will also develop high-quality virtual reality stimulation that could impact octopuses' behavior in an underwater environment. It will utilize EEG frequency-tagging techniques to determine processing of environmental stimulus by the octopus. This will allow studying whether octopuses present characteristic responses that are analogous to surprise, adaptation, working memory and attention effects (in primates and other vertebrates). The study will also allow answering how and in what manner do octopuses sleep. All data, artifacts and modeling software will be made publicly available and constitute an important resource for the community. The results of this study could impact our general understanding of how brains support complex cognitive functions, with direct relevance to artificial intelligence efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cryoplanation terraces are large upland landform features that give the impression of gigantic staircases, found in periglacial, or cold but nonglacial environments.  Although these elevated bedrock terraces have been identified and discussed in scientific literature for more than a century, debate continues about the nature of the processes responsible for their formation.  Development rates, calculated from dates of rock exposure across terrace treads, will be used to test one of the more prominent hypotheses advanced in the literature.  This hypothesis states that these terraces are formed through intensified erosion associated with snowbanks that last well into the summer months.  Recent methodological developments in geochemistry, specifically the method known as cosmogenic nuclide dating, will provide the infusion of contemporary technology necessary to make progress on this long-standing scientific issue, and has the potential to make transformative advances in the understanding of landscape development in periglacial regions.  Results from this research will be shared with the U.S. National Park Service and used to enhance park management as well as the experiences of park visitors through development of interpretive displays and trail guides in several national parks and monuments.  Further, the project will enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great antiquity of cryoplanation terraces makes terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides the most appropriate dating method for determining their age and rates of development.  Rock samples for cosmogenic nuclide dating were collected from two locations in the interior of Alaska using a transect-based sampling strategy across individual terrace treads.  Dating the exposure of the clastic rocks (clasts) will facilitate calculation of erosion rates for individual terraces, and can be compared to known erosion rates at existing late-lying snowbanks.  The PIs hypothesize that: (a) calculated development rates will be comparable with those of measured snowbank erosion; (b) exposure dates for individual rock clasts will coincide with Quaternary cold intervals; and (c) terrace treads are time-transgressive surfaces with the exposure age of clasts increasing toward the outer edge of terraces.  The landforms in this region where the rocks for this analysis were collected are representative of those in the much larger domain of unglaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere.  Therefore, the methodologic and analytic approach adopted for this project are potentially applicable throughout this vast region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archeological and genomic evidence point to eastern Beringia as a gateway through which ancient peoples first migrated from Northeast Asia, therefore the rich archaeological record of central Alaska is key in unraveling questions of adaptation and behavior of the earliest Alaskans through time. The Alaskan record exhibits sizeable technological variability from 14 thousand to 5 thousand years ago and answers to questions about the first Alaskans are still elusive: how did ancient Beringians utilize and learn the landscape around them as they first encountered it? How did they adapt their technologies and mobile strategies through millennia of shifting climate and resulting resource fluctuation? This research expands knowledge of modern human adaptation and settlement of extreme northern environments and sheds light on the impact of climate change on human populations. This research provides a graduate student with a transformative research experience to be shared with academics, the public, and with Native Alaskans and First Nations peoples to whom it is directly relevant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gore will begin to unravel questions of landscape learning and behavioral variation in the archaeological record of central Alaska through the lens of stone tool procurement and use as evident in ancient toolkits. Mapping and sampling of the lithic sources within the Nenana River valley area, from outcrop to creek and river alluvium will reconstruct the lithic landscape exploited by prehistoric Alaskans. Geochemical analysis of non-obsidian volcanic stone sources in the valley provides a fingerprint of these sources against which artifacts from archaeological sites spanning 14 ka to 5 ka will be compared to reconstruct mobile strategies, landscape use, and changes in these behaviors through time. Gore will integrate geochemical toolstone sourcing with lithic analysis of these same archaeological collections to provide a comprehensive description of behavior and behavioral change of ancient Alaskans from colonization to settling-in on the landscape. Together, these methods provide a better understanding of the nuanced and complex interactions between landscape, environment and human culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Bruce Bimber at the University of California, Santa Barbara this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of implicit and explicit racial priming within American state legislative campaigns. Both conservative and liberal social movements have increasingly integrated race-based identity claims into their agendas. While existing literature has examined the impact of racial rhetoric within national politics, little work has been done to assess the impact on state politics. This project will explore how this growing racial divide has impacted policy conversation within the American States by developing an expansive data set that catalogues state legislative campaign content by issue arena and rhetorical frame. In doing so, this project aims to inform efforts to counteract racial rhetorical frames and improve democratic engagement for all citizens. This dataset will also provide a critical data source for developing projects for future research on state politics, public policy, political campaigns, and race. Finally, by processing campaign statements into issue coverage summaries for state legislative matchups, this project aims to provide accessible information to better inform voters in lower information elections of a candidate's willingness to engage with salient issues.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to fully investigate racial rhetoric, this project will employ web-scraping techniques to preserve state legislative candidate campaign websites from 2014-2018. Websites provide a holistic approach to the analysis of campaign rhetoric as candidates possess extensive control over the content of a website while space and costs issues are at a minimum. A random sample of candidate issue statements and self-reported legislative records will be catalogued and coded by trained coders according to issue arena and content. This will provide a critical training dataset that will be used to classify the remaining statements according to issue arena using machine learning classification algorithms. The final dataset will provide an unprecedented account of state legislative campaign rhetoric by providing: 1) Character-counts that measure dedicated issue space by topic and provide a critical metric for issue salience and priming; 2) A comprehensive list of issue statements relevant to a particular policy arena that will be used to examine statements for implicit and explicit racially driven framing; 3) A complete collection of website images that provide evidence for visual priming. This data will provide evidence for variation in issue selection as a product of candidate qualities and constituent demographics, specifically racial heterogeneity of district constituents and neighboring districts. In addition, specific policy arenas, including welfare/public assistance, criminal justice, and immigration, can be examined for variation in implicit and explicit racial rhetoric across states and districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And one area of social life where ritual is most critical is in the disposition of a community's dead. among This is of particular concern for communities that have been displaced by conflict, where death rates are exceptionally high, and individuals face insecurity and a daunting scarcity of physical and legal resources that challenge the social order. The research supported by this award, which supports the training of a graduate student in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, asks how host societies deal with the high number of displaced migrants' deaths, and what role mortuary and funerary practices have for displaced communities. According to the UNHCR, the world is witnessing the highest level of forced migration on record, making this a particularly appropriate time to examine this question. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of delivering humanitarian aid. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and builds capacity and scientific infrastructure through international cooperation among scientific research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foroogh Farhang, under the supervision of Dr. Jessica Winegar of Northwestern University, explores the extent to which mortuary and funerary practices are impacted by war and displacement, and what resources, networks, rituals, and relationships are marshaled in the burial and propitiation of the dead. The research takes place in Lebanon, where after seven years of civil war in neighboring Syria, displaced Syrians are the first refugee community with no formal camps and cemeteries. They have faced the increasingly stark challenges of securing one of the scarce number of burial sites and, further, holding a proper funeral for their dead. A lack of burial spaces, in conjunction with increasing restrictions on crossing the Lebanon-Syria border, have mobilized networks of Syrian burials within the borders of Lebanon and on the route from Lebanon to Syria. Because this involves such a sizable population, and the issue is so significantly culturally, this site proves an ideal laboratory for understanding what variables aid and inhibit cultural integration. Through in-depth, long-term, and on-site ethnographic fieldwork on people's mobility within Lebanon and between Lebanon and Syria, data will be collected through interviews, participant observation, life histories, and media research among representative samples of refugees, governmental and non-governmental staff, and local leaders and community members. Data will be subjected to thematic and content analysis in order to identify, quantify, and evaluate relevant codes and themes. This study draws upon classic anthropological concerns with ritual and death to examine whether its theoretical assumptions are influenced by variables that are acutely apparent in contemporary contexts marked by war, migration, refugee integration, and transnational NGOs. This research will contribute to debates in anthropology and the social sciences more broadly about mortuary and funerary practices, governance, mobility, and humanitarianism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future work is likely to make greater use of computational work -- work that combines human and computer capabilities to perform tasks that neither could do alone.  New internet and data analytic technologies are transforming the design of computational work.  This project will use longitudinal observational field research to develop new theory and fundamental understanding of computational work designs that are currently used in real-world organizations.  The project will emphasize how computational work can eliminate some types of jobs and tasks, create others, and transform many jobs that remain.  Furthermore, this project will examine how computational work might affect worker experiences and empowerment.  Results could advance understanding on the impact of machine-intelligent technologies on human and societal well-being.  The research agenda also includes development and dissemination of an educational curriculum for students and civic leaders to better understand computational work design and its effects on organizational structure and worker experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly developed work systems now include dynamic capabilities for future work.  Specifically, machine-intelligent technologies are reshaping work by: 1) collecting data on what everyone is doing; 2) algorithmically combining human efforts or facilitating direct human integration; 3) analyzing patterns in work division and integration activities; and 4) recommending or intervening to create new ways of dividing and integrating work.  New work systems that include such activities can be understood as being engaged in computational work design.  This project will develop fundamental understanding about computational work designs used in real-world organizations, with the aim of supporting improvements to their design and operation, and to the relevant societal infrastructure.   Longitudinal, observational studies of three organizations with advanced deployments of computational work design will be conducted to develop new theory about computational work design and worker empowerment, as well as to advance qualitative research methodology.  Furthermore, this project will create and disseminate an educational curriculum to policymakers and management science students.

The reason these features evolved is uncertain, however, they are thought to have helped the ancestors of apes and humans to search for food in trees. This project will examine ape locomotion in differing environments in the wild, including forests, woodlands and grasslands, and while feeding on a variety of foods, to determine the circumstances during which distinctive anatomical features are used while foraging. The findings of this study will help to determine why apes and humans evolved features such as an upright torso and mobile shoulders, arms and hands. This project will support the education of women and underrepresented groups at all levels of education - elementary through graduate school - through students' direct involvement in the creation of science education material. The outreach in this project creates cross-cultural connections and increases the quality of science education. Students in the U.S. and at the international research site will help create science education outreach materials and contribute research and conservation virtual content for a National Museum exhibit on ape and human evolution. Scientific findings will be shared through article publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at professional meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hominoids are distinguished by an upright torso and versatile locomotion. It is hypothesized that such versatility evolved to feed on ripe fruit in the forest canopy, since that is what living apes tend to do.  However, recent fossil discoveries show that the earliest apes to display advanced anatomical features, such as an upright torso, fed on leaves and fruit in a partially open environment. To determine how locomotor versatility relates to foraging behavior, the living ape with the broadest habitat preference, the chimpanzee, will be studied. The central question of this research is: How does variation in arboreal habitat structure, and variation in food type and location, correlate with arboreal positional behavior in woodland and forest chimpanzees?  This question will be addressed using video capture and observational data on chimpanzee positional behavior in different habitats. Linear models will be employed on observational data to explore the relationship between positional modes and contextual variables. Kinematic data will be extracted from limb excursions in video footage and analyzed to determine if positional performance is correlated with ecological and individual variables, and whether excursions are greatest for those behaviors that rely on the advanced anatomical features of interest.  Studying chimpanzee movement in multiple contexts and habitats will assist in predicting why hominoids evolved innovative positional behaviors and why early hominins transitioned to a less arboreal existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This area of economics focuses on understanding how incentives affect economic outcomes, with the goal of designing effective and efficient payment and reward plans. The project aims to expand mechanism design theory by providing a new tool to study the problems caused when long-term commitment to a contract is unrealistic. For example, online retailers, insurance companies, and banks interact with their customers over time. As these firms learn about their customers, they may want to change contract terms by making personalized offers to some customers. In the same way, governments may sign agreements about sovereign debt, but bailouts and renegotiation may change the terms of the original agreement. The new method has promise for new applications of this important area of economic theory, including a range of applications from debt and mortgage contracts, monetary policy, the design of online platforms, online privacy, and auctions for advertising sales. As a result, the research could result in more effective management methods for businesses and government policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress on optimal mechanism design under limited commitment has been hindered by a lack of a tractable methodology. The team will develop a new methodology based on the idea that a mechanism should encode not only the rules to determine the allocation, but also the information the designer obtains from the interaction. This means that how much the designer learns becomes an explicit part of the design. The project has three key parts. First, the team will develop this new tool, which will be akin to the use of the revelation principle in classical mechanism design. Second, the team will use the method to characterize optimal trading mechanisms in infinite horizon settings. The characterization provides a solid foundation to Coase's conjecture and the solution method can serve as a prototype to characterize optimal fiscal policy or social insurance when governments have limited commitment ability in infinite horizon settings. Third, the team will examine the optimal design of information collection policies (for example, the use of cookies) and the resulting issues of transparency and privacy that arise when firms collect information about consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is the primary method that North American archaeologists use, and millions of dollars in federal and other funding has been spent in obtaining thousands of such dates from archaeological sites. Researchers around the world now use the changing abundance of radiocarbon dates over time as a way to reconstruct population over time, and thus to provide an important piece of human history: where and when did populations rise and decline?  How fast? How does population change relate to environmental change, technological innovation, population density, subsistence, warfare, and emigration, social and political organization?  This project has already compiled dates from the 11 western U.S. states (~42,000) and 12 Plains/Central states (~14,000); it will now move on to compile dates from the remaining eastern third of the US.  It is not only the dates themselves that are compiled, but also associated contextual information that researchers need to ""clean"" the database to create a sample useful for their specific research questions. The data will become publicly and freely available through the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database, a large and growing international radiocarbon database. It will provide researchers with a useful tool to investigate research questions in several disciplines including archaeology, paleontology, and genetics, and help move North American archaeology toward its next frontier, ""Big Data,"" since archaeology's strength is its ability to test hypotheses against patterns in data across vast reaches of space and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the question of prehistoric rates of population growth and decline. It has already discovered that the long-term rates of growth of agricultural populations are the same as earlier hunting and gathering populations, and implies that rapid population growth is only a feature of modern human life, a product of nineteenth century technological advances in food production, trade, and medical knowledge. The project has also detected a pre-AD 1500 decline in Native American populations, the cause of which is under investigation and, combined with international data, remarkable synchronicity in global population trends of the past 10,000 years. To achieve its goal the project is also investigating the ""best practices"" of statistical analysis of large samples of radiocarbon dates. Rises and declines in the number of dates per unit time is assumed to track similar rises and declines in human population. There is reason to be cautious as several variables could modify this relationship, for example, research bias, the systematic loss of dates over time due to preservation, and the effects of the standard procedure used to convert radiocarbon ages in familiar calendar dates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The third component focuses on a type of bias that may affect individual decision making, called belief distortion. The research will give us new tools to understand and predict the outcomes of social interactions and decision-making under uncertainty. These are key to understanding many economic decisions.

One surprising prediction is that even under arbitrarily small amounts of misperception, information aggregation may break down completely. The third project develops an axiomatic model of belief distortion. The aim is to provide a unified framework to understand central examples of belief distortion, such as ambiguity aversion and regret, that have been widely observed.

The spectroradiometer measures the spectral response of a diversity of materials in 2,151 visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (350 to 2,500 nm). For example, the instrument can measure how much radiation is reflected from plants, soils, or water in different wavelengths and this information can then be used to assess the nature, status, and composition of these materials across space and through time. The spectroradiometer will support ongoing research and enable new and innovative research of a diversity of users at NMSU and beyond, including but not limited to anthropologists, astronomers, biologists, computer scientists, engineers, geographers, geologists, physicists, and soil scientists. This research has the potential to transform understanding of interactions between matter and electromagnetic radiation, which is indispensable for addressing a range of societal challenges and environmental concerns such as drought and desertification. In addition to expanding the research infrastructure of NMSU, the instrument will enhance research training and teaching activities, thereby promoting the development of a skilled workforce that is diverse in gender, race, ethnicity, and professional background, a critical mission of NMSU. The spectroradiometer will also create new opportunities for extension and outreach as well as collaboration with partners in the private, public, and academic sectors.

Worldwide, drylands cover more than forty percent of Earth's land surface and are home to more than two billion people. This research is critical because human well-being and ecosystem services in these environments are currently in decline due to woody plant encroachment and biocrust degradation. Access to long-term ecological data collected across the last thirty years in southern New Mexico will provide invaluable opportunities for calibrating and evaluating research products. Questions to be answered by the research include; which wavelengths are optimal for discriminating between dryland materials, when is the best time to distinguish between dryland materials, how does map accuracy change in response to changes in spectral and spatial resolution, which algorithms are best for mapping woody plants and biocrusts, and what is the spatial and temporal distribution of these materials? Answers to these questions, along with a spectral library that will be made publicly and freely available, will help inform and improve mapping efforts in dryland ecosystems worldwide, ultimately enabling more sustainable management of these important and vulnerable environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most empirical research assumes prices are determined by firms' product portfolios, the extent to which consumers view products as differentiated, and, importantly, competition based solely on current market conditions. However, when firms expect to compete in the future and have sufficiently low discount rates, threats of future price wars can support higher prices than predicted by static pricing models. This project explores this theory in two ways. First, the investigators develop and estimate a repeated game model of oligopoly price leadership. The assumptions in the model are motivated by an industry practice where one firm proposes a markup to a coalition. The model is then used to understand how mergers change pricing incentives. Second, the investigators develop a test of static competition that is robust to how exactly firms set prices under the alternative hypothesis. This research illustrates both methodologies with empirical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research characterizes equilibrium in the price leadership model, state conditions under which marginal costs can be recovered given data on prices, quantities, and demand estimates, and characterize conditions under which firms' implied time preferences can be identified. The investigators apply the model to the U.S. brewing industry and study how the Miller/Coors joint venture changed pricing incentives. The test for static Nash competition takes into account product differentiation and multi-product ownership by individual firms. This test is applied to the U.S. canned tuna market, where two of the three largest firms recently plead guilty to price fixing. This research shows how the framework can be used to i) date cartel operations, ii) distinguish cartel participants from firms that are simply pricing optimally given its competitors are colluding and iii) study the effectiveness of the cartel by comparing observed prices and variable profits to those that arise in Nash-Bertrand equilibrium and under joint profit maximization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solitary confinement is an important but understudied part of the experience of punishment in the United States. The scant available evidence suggests solitary confinement is associated with poor health and adjustment to society after incarceration. The current project, the Pennsylvania Solitary Confinement Study (PASS), will analyze conditions of penal confinement and their effects on health and well-being, labor force participation after prison release, and recidivism. The project will provide a multidimensional account of the conditions and effects of extreme confinement in a large U.S. prison system. The project will also improve our understanding of how solitary confinement is used, and how it may have significant and long-lasting effects. A key broader impact of the project is to enable a research-driven national policy effort to reevaluate the use and policies of solitary confinement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Quantitative studies of the effects of solitary confinement have relied on observational data to estimate weakly-identified causal effects. The current project will use detailed statewide prison records (2007-2017) to estimate causal effects of solitary confinement on long-term outcomes, exploiting the random assignment of hearing examiners to prison misconduct cases. It combines field surveys of incarcerated men and prison staff in a solitary confinement unit with a quantitative state-wide analysis of administrative prison records.  The longitudinal survey data collection combines an analysis of prison records, a survey and neurocognitive battery administered to incarcerated men (N=117, including a main sample of 99 and a pretest sample of 18) recently admitted to solitary confinement and then three months later, and interviews with prison staff (N=22). Analysis of this quasi-experiment will yield estimates of the effect of solitary confinement on employment and recidivism. Because prior research on solitary confinement has been based on clinical interviews with small samples often in the context of litigation, the survey extends research by collecting data at scale with a standardized instrument.

Openness and transparency allow for original research results to be reproduced (reproducibility) and replicated using new samples (replicability), which benefit science by making findings easier to verify. This award funds a day-long preconference preceding the 2019 Biennial Meeting of the Cognitive Development Society that will address this issue by helping cognitive development researchers adopt norms and practices at all stages of the research process that support reproducibility and replicability. This will enhance the robustness of the field and allow for the extension and translation of a more reliable basic research foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norms that are consistent with reproducibility and replicability, such as pre-registering hypotheses and analyses, sharing data and analytic code, and powering studies sufficiently to effectively test hypotheses will enhance confidence in the published scientific literature. Training that will aid in embedding these norms and practices will guide social and behavioral science towards greater  reproducibility and replicability. This preconference will accomplish this goal for cognitive developmental science using presentations and tutorials on the 1) scientific evidence for the methodological and statistical challenges facing cognitive developmental science, 2) benefits of adopting tools such as the Open Science Framework for laboratory management, and 3) issues regarding multi-lab collaboration.

The project will enhance the capabilities of researchers and practitioners to incorporate the effects of atmospheric conditions and vegetation in solar radiation models that are needed to advance research about surface solar radiation, heat flux, and ground and surface water temperature dynamics.  In addition to evaluating a high-resolution, spatially explicit approach to estimating the amount of solar radiation penetrating forest canopies over extensive areas, this project will demonstrate methods for incorporating real-sky conditions in the modeling of stream temperatures.  The integrative model to be developed by the doctoral student will have the potential to be a powerful, spatially explicit tool for demonstrating linkages among stream processes, land-management, and ecosystem outcomes that can be adapted to a broad range of natural and human-modified environments.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.  The project also will provide valuable experience in collaborative interdisciplinary research for another graduate student serving as a technician on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recently developed subcanopy solar radiation modeling method that uses airborne LiDAR data and is integrated with an open-source, bare-earth solar radiation model demonstrated that light penetration through forest canopies could be estimated and used to produce high resolution estimates of subcanopy solar radiation for vegetated landscapes.  That solar radiation model allows parameterization of the effects of atmospheric conditions where the solar radiation reaching the canopy surface is affected by atmospheric aerosols, water vapor, and clouds. The information needed to parameterize atmospheric conditions is not widely available for most locations in the United States, however.  Although values representing uniformly clear or overcast sky conditions or published values of historic averages can be used, values more representative of real-sky conditions should improve the accuracy of the solar radiation estimates for specific locations and time periods.  The doctoral student will build on these recent advances in solar radiation modeling and the increased availability of remotely sensed data by incorporating the combined effects of atmospheric conditions, forest canopies, and topography to improve estimates of subcanopy solar radiation in a Southern Appalachian headwater basin.  The student will develop open-science workflows to compute the Linke Turbidity value and the clear sky index using existing methods and available satellite data for the parameterization of atmospheric conditions.  She will test the validity of the solar radiation models with general and computed atmospheric condition parameters, and she will evaluate model accuracy with field measurements of subcanopy solar radiation.  She also will determine whether the inclusion of real-sky and forest canopy conditions to estimate solar radiation improves the accuracy of steam temperature estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It presented an accessible summary of star lore based upon a now lost work of Eudoxus, and it was an immediate and lasting success as an introductory text to astronomy; an immense exegetical literature grew up around it. This literature included commentaries written by both experts in astronomy, such as Hipparchus, and non-expert authors, as well as scholia (marginal notes) written in copies of his work. The project will explore the reception of Aratus's work among later commentators, and compare the way that the latter read, understood, and interacted with this text and the astronomy it contained. Results of this project will be made public through a dedicated website which will make available ancient texts with modern English translations for the first time; they will be made accessible through an innovative and open access online platform that will display the text of Aratus and of its commentaries and scholia, along with interactive visualizations of the astronomy they contain. In addition, the PI will produce a scholarly monograph on Hipparchus' commentary to Aratus, and she will develop an exhibition and new courses on ancient astronomy and history of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a pioneering investigation in history of science. It has four main goals. It will bring Aratus and his under-appreciated exegetical community to light, study the commentary of Hipparchus under the light of the debate about the nature of science and of the best genres to disseminate it, discuss the ancient reception of Aratus among different types of readership, and discuss the different genres of scientific writing in antiquity. The authors of these ancient texts form an understudied community of thinkers, who held widely varying opinions on Aratus' status as an authority on astronomy. The project will highlight this forgotten intellectual world, and it will broaden the traditional canon of ancient authors by translating many of these texts into modern English for the first time and making them freely available through an online digital portal. One key figure under investigation in the project is Hipparchus, who responds to Aratus and with whom Ptolemy deeply engages; understanding this missing intellectual link is critical to studies of ancient science. The PI will produce an edition and commentary on Hipparchus' commentary to Aratus that will be published as an independent, scholarly monograph. The project is also innovative for its social history of scientific writing and of commentary as a genre; the authors of these texts were all writing sciences but using very different genres and media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most defining characteristics for the human species and the other primates is large brain size relative to body size. Yet, despite having larger brains than most other mammals, human and nonhuman primates do not show an increase in their basal metabolic rate (a measure of energy utilization by the body) compared to other mammals, raising the question of how the high energetic cost of such large brains is met. This trend suggests that there is an energetic trade-off with another energy-demanding tissue in the body when brain size increases; if we are not using more energy overall, then energy that could be invested in another part of our body is instead likely being utilized to fuel our large brains. Preliminary research shows that primates have low muscle mass when compared to other animals, and humans, who have the most notable increase in brain size, show a 50% reduction in overall muscle mass when compared with other mammals. This research therefore tests the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is in direct competition with the brain for glucose and oxygen, such that the high energetic demands of large brain size are met through constraining muscle mass, constituting an energetic tradeoff between skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, and brain growth and maintenance.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the brain does constrain muscle mass, then 1)larger brains should be associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass; 2)the percentage of type I muscle fibers (a type of muscle cell that uses energy [glucose, a type of sugar] in a similar fashion to brain cells) should show a relative decrease in relation to larger brain size; and 3)muscle mass development should be suppressed until brain growth is complete, and once complete, there should be an increase in muscle mass development. To test these predictions, muscle tissue samples will be collected from a diverse array of primate specimens, comprising a range of brain sizes and representing all developmental stages. The generated muscle energy use profiles for each species will then be analyzed in relation to variation in brain size, with the results applied to understanding the interaction between brain size and evolved metabolic strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reducing muscle mass may have predisposed primates such as humans to certain metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes); thus, understanding if there is such a constraint has important health implications. Ultimately, the data collected can be incorporated into studies of growth and development, as well as biomechanics, and the results may encourage development of biomedical gene therapies. The research also will provide a rich database for scientists in other disciplines focusing on animal anatomy and physiology, facilitating and expanding future research. The collaborative project brings together international researchers, and will support the training of multiple undergraduate and graduate students from three US universities.

They have also sought to create speaking and listening devices that approach the accuracy and ease of everyday communication, with modest success. The research problem has been easy to define: English is composed of more than 100,000 words created from over 16,000 different syllables and syllables are composed from a small inventory of several dozen consonants and vowels. Automatic speech recognition would be remarkably easy if these linguistic properties - words, syllables, consonants, vowels -produced uniformity in the sounds that talkers actually make. In fact, each utterance is also physically unique, whether in its sound pattern or in the visible movements of the speaker's face.  Different vocal anatomy in men, women and children causes complex variation in sound production even when the linguistic message is the same. Moreover, aspects of a talker's productions may express the dialect and speaking style of their family and linguistic community. Human listeners readily attend to the acoustic hints of these individual and social markers while also listening for the message. This project will examine how these different sources of perceptual information for speech are organized, how they are integrated over time, and how they allow perceptual tuning to the speech of individual talkers. Ultimately, a more complete account of the perception of speech can lead to improvement in recognition technology and to the creation of assistive devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three experimental projects will be performed: 1) to estimate the temporal dynamics of auditory sensory integration; 2) to determine the dimensions of exposure-based perceptual tuning to the characteristics of individual talkers; and, 3) to describe and model the intrinsic differences in auditory and visual temporal sensitivity and persistence that affect audiovisual speech perception. In each instance, the perceptual sensitivity to linguistic properties, talker characteristics, and language general features of spoken language will be assayed using discriminating and robust measures of auditory and audiovisual resolution. The studies explore the versatility of perceptual faculties applied to speech and provide an opportunity to identify the principles underlying the remarkably robust perceptual abilities that support and sustain communication. The overall goal is a formal and functional characterization of the cognitive resources that insure the perceptual stability of spoken communication in natural environments, whether the source of speech is visible or not, whether the talker is familiar or not, and whether the quality of the sensory samples of speech is natural or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Roseanna,,Sommers,sommers@uchicago.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,09/01/2018,08/31/2021,250855.00,"The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution aims to protect the public from unreasonable search and seizure by requiring authorities to have probable cause before conducting a search. However, the vast majority of police searches today are authorized by citizens' voluntary consent. Consent searches do not require probable cause, which means that an individual can be singled out based on an officer's hunch, or for no reason at all. The legality of these consent searches rests on the ""voluntariness test,"" an assessment of whether a reasonable person would feel free to refuse the officer's request or walk away. This test requires third-party decision-makers to engage in a perspective-taking task. They must determine how it would feel to be approached by a police officer and confronted with a search request. A key insight from social psychology is that people tend to perform such tasks poorly. In particular, people underappreciate the role of situational pressure and feelings of discomfort when judging others' behavior. This insight suggests that outside observers may not fully recognize the distress citizens are likely to experience when considering the prospect of saying ""no"" to a police officer. In a series of experiments, the current research will assess whether these perspective-taking errors cause outside observers to systematically overestimate how free a reasonable person would feel to refuse a search request, and, accordingly, whether the voluntariness test is biased against citizens who have consented to a search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will introduce and validate a new experimental paradigm through which to examine the psychological task of assessing voluntariness. In this paradigm, one group of participants will be asked an intrusive and consequential search request, while another group of participants predicts how a reasonable person would respond to this request. It is hypothesized that participants in the ""prediction"" condition will underestimate compliance rates, despite having access to all the same information as participants in the ""actual search"" condition. In pilot studies, this paradigm generated large differences between predicted and observed compliance, indicating its promise for addressing long-standing questions related to the perceived and actual voluntariness of consent search. In addition to testing for main effects, the current research will test for moderation by features of the search request that might reduce the gap between perceived and actual voluntariness. Notifying participants that they could refuse a search without penalty, a frequently proposed solution by critics of consent search sometimes referred to as ""Miranda-for-search,"" was not found to be effective at reducing this gap in pilot studies. Thus, the current research will explore alternative possible solutions, such as seeking written consent. Identifying features of the search request that effectively decrease the gap between perceived and actual voluntariness is essential for developing empirically supported policy recommendations related to changes to the law and/or to the practices used by law enforcement agents to obtain consent from citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This dissertation is a step towards beginning to answer this call. Adult second language learners are often able to function at some level in a foreign language, but the influence of the native language during second language learning and use is known to negatively affect proficiency levels. Second language learners often experience the frustration of trying to remember a recently learned word in a second language, but only being able to retrieve the word in the native language. An important goal, then, is to learn to regulate interference from the native language to achieve higher proficiency in a second language. This project proposes to investigate how this might be possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The electrophysiological brain activity of English speakers who are learning Spanish will be measured during the learning of new word combinations, for example, ""despertar dudas.""  This collocation literally translates as ""awaken doubts"" but is expressed in English with the phrase ""raise doubts"". Using a word combination like ""despertar dudas"" requires the suppression of the English translation equivalent ""raise doubts"".

This represents nearly four million children who speak Spanish at home while attending school in English. The linguistic variation that these children are exposed to is one possible factor that may contribute to the persistent achievement gap between school-age ELLs and their monolingual, English-speaking peers. Research that investigates how bilingual language development progresses during the school-age period is critically needed to understand the factors that affect language development at this age and to develop programs that facilitate linguistic growth and academic success in all learners. Contrary to historical 'English-only' approaches, recent evidence suggests that providing ELLs with academic training in their first and second language leads to better outcomes in both languages. However, it is less clear what specific aspects of development contribute to this observation and what their long-term effects into adulthood may be. This study investigates the impact of literacy in ELLs' first language as one important component of school-age development that may enhance the ability to comprehend oral language. The findings of this study will have important consequences for young ELLs, who commonly acquire reading and writing skills in their second language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes a psycholinguistic perspective to investigate the role of literacy in the language development of school-age ELLs. It tests the Literacy Enhancement Hypothesis, which claims learning to read and write improves language comprehension by strengthening an individual's ability to more efficiently monitor morphological structures. The linguistic focus is gender and number markers on nouns and participles in Spanish because these are often important cues for tracking referents in complex sentences, such as passives, which are more frequent in written than in spoken language. In some cases, successfully interpreting (im)plausible passive sentences in Spanish requires listeners to attend to morphosyntactic agreement dependencies between the verb and its object. Study 1 tests 9-10 year old Spanish-speaking children (half in dual language, half in English only schools) and Study 2 tests low to high literate Spanish-speaking adults. Both studies include two identical experiments. One experiment uses visual world eye tracking techniques to measure how learning to read and write in Spanish affects these speakers' ability to use gender markers on past participles in passives sentences to anticipate the object of a sentence. The other experiment uses event related potentials (ERPs) to measure if differences in brain responses to critical words in similar sentences indicate how literacy impacts the use of syntactic and semantic information during auditory sentence processing. The findings will help improve understanding of the interaction between literacy and linguistic knowledge, and how this interaction impacts cognitive processes involved in oral language comprehension in child and adult bilinguals with different academic language exposure and experience in their native language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will address this issue through the examination of a data set of over 400 recordings of such interactions to better understand what transpires: when do the interactions produce conflict, when do they not, and why?

At 3.0 Ma, multiple species of Australopithecus are represented in the fossil record across eastern and southern Africa. By 2.5 Ma, Australopithecus mostly died out, and in its place evolved two separate lineages with very different adaptations to the environment. One lineage is our own, Homo, characterized by a pattern of increased brain size and dependence on material culture that has persisted over the last several million years. The other lineage, Paranthropus, lasted over 1 million years, and was represented by three species with unique dental and facial adaptations for potentially eating tough or hard foods. Despite the obvious importance of this interval, it is poorly represented in the fossil record and few fossil specimens have been found that can shed light on the causes and patterns of the origins of these lineages. The Ledi-Geraru Research Project works in a fossiliferous region that includes this important time interval and aims to illuminate the issues relevant to the extinction of Australopithecus and the emergence of Homo and Paranthropus.

This question identifies a key challenge in the field of memory research: translating cognitive neuroscience findings from the laboratory into strategies that are useful in the real-world. Although memory researchers have identified a set of well-accepted findings and strategies for memory success (for example: elaboration, pattern separation, and transfer-appropriate processing), these strategies have rarely been integrated or even contrasted with one another. By doing so in the current project, we may be able to identify common principles of memory function that translate to real-world learning and memory. We expect that these common principles will increase our understanding of how the brain codes memories and will reveal additional strategies that can be used to improve learning. The ideas from this project will be translated into strategies that will be taught to students entering college. This outreach program will increase student confidence and success and is intended to improve educational outcomes relative to higher education costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well-established principles, including transfer-appropriate processing, encoding specificity, and elaboration, are known to produce benefits to long-term memory in the laboratory. However, we do not yet know: 1) how these principles relate to one another or to hippocampal memory representations and 2) how these principles can be translated into real-world implications. The first question is of great theoretical and scientific significance and must be answered for our understanding of long-term episodic memory to advance, whereas the second is of great educational and societal significance and must be answered to improve our educational systems. The current project develops a unified account of the role of context in episodic memory, addressing both questions. This account proposes that elaboration, transfer-appropriate processing, and pattern separation (via hippocampal coding) have cognitive and neural mechanisms in common whose identification will both transform our understanding of long-term memory and lead to new strategies for learning. The objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of transfer-appropriate processing from a new perspective: as it relates to context and hippocampal activation patterns, 2) test the prediction, derived from cognitive studies of elaborative rehearsal, that variability in context and hippocampal activation patterns improves retrieval, and 3) test the prediction, derived from animal studies of the hippocampus, that pattern separation of similar events increases context resolution and cue specificity. The ideas in this project, along with existing findings, will be taught to incoming university students who are the first in their family to attend college or who are from underserved populations and may not previously have been taught effective strategies for independent learning.

For example, using stone tools to target large-bodied prey and subsequent food-sharing practices most likely formed part of a complex behavioral pattern that satisfied both the caloric and nutritional needs while also building social cohesion and complexity. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate small mammal prey as another potentially important dietary component for hominins. Small mammal acquisition is typically associated with technological complexity (i.e., snares and nets) yet these animals have also been simultaneously considered ""easy"" targets for early human ancestors that obviate the need for complex tools. Reasons for this contradiction probably lie within the ecological and behavioral diversity of small mammals, which potentially demands a broad range of foraging strategies. The project will advance knowledge about dietary hominin adaptations, foster student training and mentoring, international research collaborations, and public science outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By incorporating taphonomic, ethnoarchaeological, and stable isotope analyses of small mammals remains from a Late Pleistocene and Holocene archaeological sequence, the investigator will test how small mammal subsistence strategies vary between two hominin species (Homo floresiensis and Homo sapiens) and between two modern human subsistence lifestyles (hunting-gathering and agriculture). Taphonomic analyses of small mammal remains will identify which animals were accumulated in the bone assemblage at Liang Bua and what agents (e.g., predators) were responsible. Stable isotope and ethnoarchaeological analyses will be used to elucidate small mammal diet and habitat through time as well as aid in identifying bone surface modifications from modern small mammal hunting practices, respectively. This study will also offer a framework for similar small mammal taphonomic studies investigating subsistence strategies of two hominin species at different geographical time periods and/or regions. In addition, this project will employ a novel Bayesian statistical method for predicting accumulating agents on an assemblage-level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, research on social networks and neural information processing are almost always conducted in isolation. Cognitive neuroscientists typically study mental processing without considering how individuals are influenced by their social networks, and the structure and dynamics of social networks are usually studied without considering the workings of the minds that comprise them. This research effort integrates theory and methods from cognitive neuroscience and network science to test how the brain shapes and is shaped by its social context. It will synthesize and extend recent developments in social cognitive neuroscience and network science to test how individual differences in unconstrained processing of naturalistic stimuli shape and are shaped by individuals' positions in a real-world social network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will characterize the multirelational social network of a bounded community based on all members' reported relationships and interactions with each other. A subset of the members will complete a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving free-viewing of audiovisual stimuli. This project is grounded in prior work that suggests that inter-subject similarities of fMRI response time series predict distances between people in their social network, but extends that work in four novel directions. First, by capitalizing on developments in multilayer network analysis, which will also be advanced further, the research will relate neural response similarities to distances between individuals within and across layers of their shared social network. This will yield insight into the extent to which associations between social network proximity and inter-individual similarities in neural responding are specific to friendship or extend more generally to homophily. Second, integrating multilayer network analysis and longitudinal fMRI will elucidate the extent to which neural response similarities cause or result from proximity between individuals in the multirelational social network of their community. Third, pairing multilayer network methods and longitudinal fMRI will shed light on how a person's importance across interaction types in a social network may relate to his/her influence on how other network members process the world around them. Fourth, the project will relate social network position to inter-individual neural variability not only in terms of fMRI response time series, but also in terms of multi-voxel response patterns corresponding to high-level event representations and how such representations are stored in memory. This work will also develop and advance approaches for analyzing multirelational networks; this will be useful to the broad range of scholars who study network phenomena, particularly in social and brain networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the active drivers of vehicles are usually less susceptible to motion sickness than the passive passengers, the development of self-driving cars (autonomous vehicles) makes all of the occupants passengers. One benefit of autonomous vehicles is that they free passengers to perform many activities typically done at their homes or offices. Unfortunately,  when these activities require focused visual attention, such as reading, working, or watching videos,  the likelihood of experiencing motion sickness increases.  The goals of the current project are to identify the key factors that contribute to motion sickness in autonomous vehicles, to identify factors that characterize who will be most susceptible, and to develop ways to reduce motion sickness and declines in performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will evaluate three aspects of individuals' responses to stimulation that might provoke motion sickness: 1) the initial sensitivity to a stimulus, 2) the decay of motion sickness severity following discontinuation of stimulation, and 3) the rate of adaptation following repeated stimulation. Of key concern is whether for a given individual, initial sensitivity, decay, and adaptation will be consistent across different types of sickness-inducing stimulation. The approach is based on a mechanistic model of motion sickness derived from neurophysiological and behavioral evidence concerning the relationship between  motion sickness onset and disruptions of vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-motor control. The role of active control of forthcoming stimulation (the fact that the driver rarely becomes motion sick) will be systematically evaluated to determine the extent to which anticipation plays a role in sickness prevention. The investigators will compare initial sensitivity, decay, and adaptability of motion sickness across stimulation involving a) the semicircular canals of the inner ear, which are sensitive to angular acceleration, b) the otolith organs of the inner ear, which are sensitive to linear acceleration, c) both in combination, and d) vision in order to assess their contributions to an individual's overall pattern of motion sickness vulnerability under active and passive conditions. The aim is to develop predictors of an individual's sensitivity to the factors contributing to motion sickness in autonomous vehicles (control vs. no-control, frequency and amplitude dependent characteristics of vehicle motion, and focal visual attention tasks). This capability would allow remedial steps to be taken to reduce sickness likelihood and optimize the benefits of this new technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The case studies of federal government agencies and their participatory technology assessment practices that are to be developed in this project have the potential to inform how numerous types of technical experts plan and implement such assessments in practice; it will result in practical lessons learned for improving future collaborations. Beyond academic publications and conference presentations, the results of this study will be used to develop a best practices handbook for effective collaboration between boundary organizations that specialize in public engagement and government agencies.

It has harmful effects on its targets, including disengagement and withdrawal from work and school, decreased performance, and increased anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms that adversely affect health. The effects of sexual harassment extend beyond those personally targeted by these incidents. For example, it can undermine organizational outcomes, leading to a loss of human capital, reduced organizational diversity, lowered productivity and profits, and fiscal damages. To remedy the effects of sexual harassment and lessen these costs requires that people are able to perceive and recognize sexual harassment when it occurs. Yet research shows that sexual harassment is extremely under-reported both by its targets and by others in society. This project explores one important potential barrier that prevents individuals from perceiving sexual harassment. It focuses on people's mental images of womanhood, and how those mental images influence the perception of sexual harassment. The conceptual development of this project compares narrow mental images of traditional womanhood (as White, straight, traditionally feminine) with broader mental images of womanhood that include those who are not White, not straight, or not traditionally feminine. By uncovering ways to broaden the image of who experiences sexual harassment, sexual harassment should be more readily identified. Because identifying sexual harassment is fundamental to its resolution, understanding and addressing the barriers to perceiving sexual harassment is essential to the realization of civil rights as well as to reducing costs to individuals and society that exist when sexual harassment goes undetected.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses laboratory and field methods to investigate the relationship between images people possess about targets of sexual harassment and their images of womanhood. The studies consider whether images of sexual harassment targets overlap with images of traditional womanhood, and whether sexual harassment is more readily perceived by observers and potential targets the more closely women fit with the image of traditional womanhood. A final set of experiments explores whether broadening the image of the types of women who experience sexual harassment increases perceptions of sexual harassment targeting those who do not fit the traditional womanhood image. Participants in the studies include college students, non-student adults, and legal gatekeepers. Traditional womanhood is operationalized along personality dimensions that vary within women and using broader group identities (e.g., race, sexual orientation) that overlap to varying degrees with the traditional image of womanhood. The research will identify a potential barrier that prevents perceptions of sexual harassment, and will suggest low-cost solutions that can remove this barrier. This project will be helpful to scholars and practitioners who address civil rights law, as well as to organizations seeking to address sexual harassment. Evidence concerning best practices will be important in the development of more effective approaches to sexual harassment, ultimately improving workforce diversity and mitigating the deleterious effects of sexual harassment on its targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous models examining the impact of drought on food security have not incorporated food trade and food movements at fine spatial scales, yet these components are critical parts of regional food systems. In sub-Saharan Africa droughts and floods account for approximately 80% of fatalities and 70% of the economic losses that are due to natural hazards. Zambia is particularly vulnerable to droughts, having high levels of malnutrition, poverty, income inequality, exposure to HIV/AIDS and malaria, and low levels of educational attainment. Zambia's agricultural production is rain-fed, which further increases vulnerability in the region. With the extreme vulnerability of the region, Zambia serves as an ideal place to study how the interactions between drought risk, crop production, trade, and policy affect food security. By incorporating the effects of trade and policy into predictive hydrological and agricultural models, this project is improving existing early warning systems for famine which rarely assess the capacity for a region to ameliorate drought via food transfers and trade.  &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This project's goal is to understand the effect of drought hazards in subsistence agriculture using a novel integrative framework that merges data, models, and knowledge of drought risk and crop production; their interactions with the dynamics of trade-based and aid-based responses; and their effect on household food security and consumption. We are addressing three questions: 1) What are the spatio-temporal scales of drought risk across Zambia and how does risk transfer into agricultural impacts? 2) What is the role of trade and domestic food policy on food security at local to national levels? 3) Can drought impacts be more effectively reduced by integrating an understanding of policy and food transfers into an agricultural drought early warning system?  To answer these questions, we are collecting  biophysical data to characterize historical droughts and their impacts on regional agriculture; examining household and market level data to characterize food security outcomes, market prices, and food sourcing; using complex network analysis to characterize food trade and flows; assessing market integration associated with price fluctuations and infrastructure to determine economic exposure and resilience at the household, community and district levels; examining how policies at the national scale constrain decisions at the local scale; and developing computational models for high resolution predictions and to explore probabilistic solutions for resource allocation and risk management.

In the health care sector, yielding the greatest value possible from rapidly expanding digitalized health data resources is essential to address pressing societal issues related to cost, quality, safety and access. Health data governance remains challenged by technical, institutional and competitive factors. How health data are governed - by whom, for what purposes, on whose behalf and through what organizational forms and structures - are vital questions. This project examines how organizational forms develop around health data resources. Viewing health data as shared societal resources rather than merely as organizational assets calls into question whether new governance forms can develop, what influences their emergence, and what factors enable or limit effective governance of these resources. The findings from this study will develop new knowledge with application for policy settings as well for health system leaders and technology innovators on how to alter organizational forms to produce more value from health data and thereby improve the health care system and benefit public welfare. Findings will be disseminated to relevant health data organizations and associations such as the National Association of Health Data Organizations. This interdisciplinary project spanning communications, public health and information technology management contributes to research capabilities and educational curricula for health data management, data science, and information policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates three research questions: (1) What organizational forms emerge to address challenges and opportunities of big data governance? (2) What institutional and sociotechnical factors enable or inhibit the establishment of new organizational forms of data governance? (3) How do varied organizational forms address the multiple, possibly conflicting, interests and values of societal and organizational stakeholders to enhance value realized from data resources? These questions are addressed through a series of embedded case studies of an emerging organization form of health data governance, the All-Payer Claims Databases (APCD) in the U.S. health care sector. The three phases include a historical analysis of the APCD movement at the national level including the All-Payer Claims Database Council, in-depth case studies of four states' APCDs, and field-level analysis of the State of Hawai'i APCD project. Through comparative case analysis, the research examines how and why there is significant variation in organizational forms among 30 state projects and what are the implications for the societal, organizational, and individual value realized through these resources. The project supports theorizing the process and outcomes of governance form emergence, develops a series of embedded case study reports of APCDs, and creates an analytical codebook and structure useful for analyzing governance of other health data domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of this research project will therefore contribute to economic science, and more important, allow for a better understanding of how policy changes or external influences are transmitted throughout the larger economy.  This will allow economist to provide more informed advice to policymakers and in so doing, enhance economic growth and improve the living standards of Americans.

This research project will develop new techniques to construct nonlinear solutions to macroeconomic models in which occasionally-binding constraints play an important role.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop and apply a piecewise-linear solution method that trades off a little of accuracy against computational speed and is scalable to large models used by central banks.

Previous scholarship on climate-human relationship focused on unique morphological and behavioral adaptations of early humans to hot, arid and open savanna habitats, and causally linked the dispersal of early humans with the development of savanna grasslands in Eurasia. However, evidence for an expansion of a savanna corridor at broad millennial temporal scales and/or at a global continental spatial scale is ambiguous and necessitates consideration that disparate climatic processes operating on narrower temporal scales and local spatial scales may have played a critical role in this cardinal and foundational event. Novel, state-of-the-art, complementary and interdisciplinary methods derived from archaeology and geosciences are well-placed to break new ground by focusing on seasonality and other high-resolution spatial and temporal climatic and environmental patterns as some of the driving forces for dispersal of early Homo. This collaboration of archaeologists, geochemists, paleontologists, and geologists from the United States, Israel, Republic of Georgia, and Australia will explore the unfamiliar pattern of seasonality, climate and environment which early humans faced in the Levant. Knowledge of the type, extent and degree of past biological human adaptation holds promise for illuminating issues on the distributions and capacities of modern humans in varying climatic regimes. Anthropogenic climate change is one of the most perilous processes facing humanity in the 21st century and understanding human biological limits is paramount in addressing these global concerns.

This has led to the empirical dissociation of adaptive integrated systems, and a lack of understanding of how components of the skeleton co-vary. This project will collate a large 3D database of skeletal elements for 13 anthropoid taxa and construct covariance matrices reflecting functional, developmental, and anatomical modularity. Quantitative genetic analyses will be used to test the nature and extent of integration patterns across primates and assess which modules have been shaped by neutral versus non-neutral forces. The results will create a direct link between the pattern and magnitude of integration and the past forces that shaped primate skeletal diversity more broadly, thus providing future researchers with a better understanding of which traits best reflect neutral divergence, and which have been subject to adaptive forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet with the explosion of online news coverage, Americans now routinely consume information from a wide variety of sources, including many that did not exist a decade ago.  In this new media landscape, citizens encounter information that depicts the Supreme Court as deliberative, unbiased, and apolitical; or they may receive coverage that is very negative, ideologically polarized, and even inaccurate. Because the authority of the Court rests on the public's understanding of its procedures and guiding principles, the coverage that citizens encounter has significant ramifications for the rule of law.  This project provides the first large scale investigation of Supreme Court media coverage across thousands of news outlets and explores the implications when it comes to support for the Court and the rule of law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of three main components.  First, the project develops a web application that allows for the automated collection of Supreme Court news coverage from a wide variety of mainstream and non-traditional news sources online, in real time. The project will make text and image data from the application publicly available in a user-friendly format, so that scholars will be able to search and refine coverage based on dates, keywords, and sources, among other features. Second, the project develops a theoretical framework for understanding the most important features of coverage in a new media landscape.  The framework highlights differences in the frames, tone, and complexity of coverage across mainstream and non-traditional outlets, specifically as they apply to Supreme Court news.  The insights are tested by leveraging multiple text analysis tools and applying them to the coverage corpus.  Third, the project explores the effects of both the content of coverage and media fragmentation more generally. The theoretical framework highlights the content and number of choices as two key aspects of the new media landscape. The project highlights how coverage that is simplistic, ideological, and negative in tone may increase the perception of the Court as a political institution, affecting the public's support for the Court and the rule of law.  Using an experimental approach, the theory is tested with a series of novel survey experiments administered to U.S. citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Law and Social Sciences program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

IPUMS is the world's largest population database, with information describing over one billion individuals drawn from 365 censuses and surveys taken in 94 countries. The extraordinary growth and redistribution of population and economic resources are reshaping the planet. To meet the challenges created by rapid demographic, economic, and environmental change, researchers must have full and open access to the best possible information. This project will expand the geographic and chronological coverage of the database, preserve it for future generations, and make the data available to users around the world. IPUMS data already have stimulated new research that transcends national boundaries and static interpretation. The data are broadly used by national and international agencies to inform policy. This project will enhance scientific understanding of critical policy-related issues such as population aging, international migration, climate change, and the effects of government programs on economic development and well-being. The project will promote teaching, training, and learning through three mechanisms. IPUMS will provide online data analysis and promote the sharing of curricular materials. Training workshops will be conducted, and the research team will further develop online training modules on how to use the data. The project will continue to employ a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate research assistants, including members of underrepresented groups, who will develop valuable skills in an interdisciplinary environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will conduct five major activities. First, the research team will obtain and preserve the newest data as soon as they become available and seek out data from the 1960s through the 1980s that are at risk of destruction. Second, the research team will clean and process the data, drawing samples, correcting errors, applying confidentiality edits, and coding the data consistently across countries. Third, comprehensive documentation will be developed to guide users on the meaning of census and survey responses and their comparability across time and space. Fourth, the research team will maintain and improve the data access system. Fifth, education and dissemination activities will be expanded. IPUMS also will undertake activities designed to strengthen relationships with partner statistical agencies and promote long-run organizational sustainability. These activities will multiply the quality, quantity, accessibility, and interoperability of information about the changing human population, creating a transnational resource of unprecedented power for understanding human society on a global scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will enhance fundamental knowledge about the ways that the interactions between humans and deer (as well as interactions with plants, ticks, and other objects involved in human-deer relationships) shape the motivations and rationales behind different wildlife management strategies.  The project will demonstrate how different management strategies circulate and evolve across different locations, with varied approaches to environmental management being adapted in different locales as humans and deer develop new relationships within cohabited spaces.  Through the examination of human-nonhuman relationships and the varied local and networked forces that influence the politics of wildlife management, this project will contribute new information and insights regarding wildlife management and environmental politics in urban and suburban environments.  Project findings will support the development of wildlife management strategies that are responsive to the distinct conditions of suburban and urban areas.  The project also will provide research-oriented education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and it will support the development of high school and college curricular materials that use suburban wildlife case studies to understand socioecological systems and environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As many wildlife populations recover or migrate into urban and suburban residential areas, residents and local governments face new questions related to whether and how to manage species that previously were absent or rare.  Much of the research on wildlife management has been concerned with the maintenance of populations to support sustainable recreational hunting, herd health, and forest ecology, but wildlife management plans in suburban communities must respond to distinct concerns that often are related to health, safety, and property of people.  The successful population recovery and growth of many animal populations within suburban and urban environments raises questions about the place of animals in human-dominated spaces and challenges traditional wildlife management approaches.  The investigators will consider the shifting management strategies and policies related to white-tailed deer across municipalities in Massachusetts and New York, where deer populations have increased precipitously in many areas and many local governments have responded by creating hotly debated deer management programs that change access to public lands and hunting policies.  The investigators will seek answers to three sets of questions regarding emerging deer management strategies:  (1) How do concerns about deer and the practices of deer management differ across and within municipalities in Massachusetts and New York, and how have municipal rules about deer hunting changed over the past two decades?  (2) How have suburban managers (broadly defined to include all actors in deer management and conflicts) come to know and be concerned about deer, and when and how do deer become overabundant and thus an object of management?  (3) How have suburban managers learned about deer management, and how are management strategies from elsewhere negotiated and fit to new contexts?  The investigators will address these questions using a nested, mixed-method approach that will combines surveys, geospatial analysis, in-depth interviews, archival research, and participant observation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of data are commonly encountered in finance, longitudinal studies, wearable device studies, medical imaging, and electronic health records. Complex data present substantial challenges for preserving subjects' privacy while making data that will advance scientific understanding and policy making publicly available. The project will make major theoretical and methodological contributions to statistical data privacy and to the fields it relies on, such as statistics and computer science. Formal privacy tools now are being adopted by major companies and government agencies for sharing data summaries. This research will demonstrate how even large complex structures, such as human faces, can be made private if that structure is properly exploited. The methods to be developed will have applications in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, medical research, and industry. The investigators will mentor a post-doctoral researcher, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. Open-source software packages will be developed and made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary research project will improve upon methods in statistical disclosure limitation, differential privacy, and functional data analysis to develop formal privacy tools. These tools are essential in the era of big data. The project will focus on three aims: (1) Development of privacy tools for objects in infinite-dimensional linear spaces, especially functions and surfaces.  These tools will include non-Gaussian perturbations, exponential mechanisms, and a special focus on functional principal components and regression, given their prominence in functional data analysis; (2) Development of privacy mechanisms for modeling and sharing of objects in nonlinear spaces that can be described as Riemannian manifolds.  Such data arises naturally when working with 3D images, shapes, covariance matrices, or large scale spatio-temporal data.  The manifold structure will be used to develop perturbation methods, especially Gaussian, that produce representative sanitized estimates and data with greater statistical utility; (3) Development of synthetic data mechanisms for samples from infinite dimensional linear spaces or nonlinear manifolds.  Synthetic data are becoming increasingly critical for expediting scientific progress while maintaining data privacy.  However, producing synthetic data that properly mimics the complex structures described here remains a major open problem.

This project develops new techniques to capture relevant sources of heterogeneity which are not directly observed in the data, but can be inferred using repeated observations of individual choices or other outcomes. Flexibly modeling unobserved differences between agents with individual-specific parameters raises important challenges in terms of computation and statistical inference. The approach developed in this project is based on dimension reduction methods whereby heterogeneous agents are grouped into a small number of types.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Discrete methods provide a way to reduce the dimensionality of heterogeneity. This may be advantageous for both computational and statistical reasons. However, existing methods such as finite mixtures face computational challenges, and they are mostly studied under the strong assumption that heterogeneity is discrete in the population. The investigators broaden the scope of discrete methods, by developing computationally tractable two-step estimators and studying their properties in the absence of such substantive assumptions. This research also illustrates the usefulness of these methods in applications, particularly in structural models where allowing for unobserved heterogeneity raises important challenges, and in models with two-sided heterogeneity."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Richard N. Aslin at Haskins Laboratories and Dr. Janet F. Werker at University of British Columbia, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist, investigating how early bilingual experiences shape the mind and brain during infancy. Recent years have featured a sudden increase in global migration and growth of multilingual communities. Language acquisition is the greatest predictor of success in school and later life. The research proposed here aims to examine how early bilingual experiences impact language outcomes, early cognition and brain development. The findings (1) will advance our understanding of how being raised bilingual prepares an infant for later learning, (2) could ultimately inform educational practices for young learners as well as policy practices that revolve around language resources and needs, and (3) aid in the design of effective educational pedagogies for linguistically diverse families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive and neural development arises partly from everyday learning experiences, including language acquisition. Infants acquire language effortlessly, yet bilingual babies must learn twice as many words. To successfully acquire their languages, bilingual babies must differentiate each language, track its features, and keep these representations separate. However, the doubling of linguistic contexts may impose an increased demand on attentional mechanisms that support bilinguals' management of their languages. Thus, some suggest that a bilingual environment should heighten and improve attentional control mechanisms (i.e., the ability to focus selectively and cast out unnecessary information). One way to examine how early bilingual experiences impact cognition is by establishing the developmental nature of these changes, while infants are beginning to distinguish their languages and whether this experience alters the plasticity of brain networks and consequently behavior. The present project examines whether managing two languages during infancy alters attentional mechanisms, and supports language outcomes. It is hypothesized that as bilingual infants gain proficiency at distinguishing their languages, their brain responses and behavior for attentional control will also show different developmental patterns than monolingual infants. Ninety infants will participate in a session at 6- and 9-months. Infants will include 30 monolingual English learning, 30 bilingual English-Chinese learning, and 30 bilingual English-other language learning. Parents will complete questionnaires on their child's language experiences, vocabulary knowledge, and a behavioral report on attentional control; these forms will also be mailed to parents when children are 12-, 18- and 24-months old. The study will use functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activity, and eye-tracking technology to measure infants' performance. Infants will sit on their parents' lap while completing a visuo-spatial attentional control task and a language-discrimination task. The study's methodology is innovative, as it incorporates neuroimaging and eye-tracking techniques simultaneously, as part of a longitudinal brain-behavior approach with young infants. Thus, it will introduce innovative methods linking neuroimaging and behavioral data to better characterize infant capabilities. More broadly, this work will inform developmental theories on how early life experiences, such as bilingualism, impact early cognition and brain plasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emphasis will be placed upon the role of non-elite in the emergence of democracy.  Bioarchaeology, the study of human remains in archaeological and historical contexts, is well suited to give voice to the non-elite, often the silent people of the past, who infrequently appear in written sources, art, and architecture. By linking science to the humanities, this project will combine a variety of lines of evidence to shed light into the life conditions and mortuary treatment of the non-elite and the outsiders in early city-state communities. In addition, this project will enhance the visibility of females in the profession. It will also build a number of collaborations between US and non-US academic institutions and will thus provide research venues for dissertations and postdoctoral research positions expanding the range and impact of US archaeological activities. It will also provide significant training for undergraduate, graduate, and junior professionals in the field of bioarchaeology and related scientific methods, such as chemical analysis for the reconstruction of past diets and population movement. Furthermore, this project will significantly advance the cause of cross-disciplinary research and analysis. At the same time, through its pioneering approach to the recovery, management, and dissemination of bioarchaeological data, this project will serve as a model for future studies of similar nature, scope, and ambition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this broader context, this project will focus on the archaic city-state of Athens and the social, political, and economic factors that led to the development of the foundations of the modern western society.

The researchers will examine possible changes in residence, diet, health, demographics, and activities in relation to mortuary treatment. How were the non-elite buried? Were they incorporated in formal cemeteries of the city? Was violence sanctioned within the social milieu during times of political upheaval and how is this represented in the mortuary record?

Increasing knowledge about the negative effects of conventional agriculture on health and the environment as well as deepening food insecurity worldwide have recently pushed global policy institutions to promote an agroecological model of cultivation. This model uses ecological principles to produce food with low inputs and without pesticides or artificial fertilizers. While this alternative model has been entering policy discourse and practice at global and local levels, many people all over the world have already been creating alternative networks around ecological production and consumption. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, aims to understand how these networks operate on the ground by focusing on the moral decisions and economic considerations of producers and consumers. In addition to enhancing scientific understanding of ecological agriculture from an anthropological perspective, the findings would be useful to policy organizations that seek to establish ecological cultivation as a response to food insecurity, environmental degradation, and public health concerns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burge Abiral, under the supervision of Dr. Anand Pandian of Johns Hopkins University, will explore the new sphere of ecological food production and consumption that has been forming. This research asks: How do ecological farmers justify their cultivation choices in using specific agroecological techniques, as they attend to consumer demand and seek adequate profit? Through which decisions and strategies are ecological food products priced and marketed? How do ecological food products get to be valued in the different phases of the supply chain? How are ecological norms established among the diverse actors in this food network? The research takes place in Turkey, where the researcher has identified two distinct groups engaged in production that can be comparatively studied to analyze more longstanding against nascent ecological agricultural networks. The project will involve 12 months of multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork, during which a combination of research techniques, such as interviews, household surveys, and archival research will be conducted. This research will inform debates in anthropology and the social sciences broadly about development, agricultural production, and food security, as well as economic anthropological debates about moral economies and value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses basic social and environmental questions regarding the development of early agrarian civilizations, and the social and physical landscapes they engendered and in which modern societies continue to live. Interdisciplinary studies featuring collaboration between archaeologists, geographers and earth scientists are particularly well-suited to apply deep time perspectives to the role of long-term environmental change, and thereby assess competing explanations for early urban collapse, as exemplified in the Southern Levant and witnessed repeatedly elsewhere. Understanding possible trajectories and potential impacts of ancient environmental change holds major implications for understanding how and why the earliest urban civilizations rose and collapsed. Accordingly, this research illuminates the often-precarious relationships between agrarian societies, both ancient and modern, and their ecological settings. This project takes great pride in the training of young female scholars in archaeology and geography. Among the five principal collaborators on this project, four are women, including two early career female assistant professors, one of whom is of Hispanic descent. This project will continue to recruit students from underrepresented groups and provide opportunities that broaden their participation in science through multiple avenues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In close collaboration with their research team, Drs.

This study features a controlled comparative analysis of environmentally-sensitive evidence excavated from four strategically-selected Bronze Age communities along the Jordan Rift: two in the northern Jordan Valley, Jordan and two lying just east of the Dead Sea Basin. Each pair of excavated sites includes a village occupied during urban abandonment (2500-2000 BC) and a village inhabited during the rebirth of cities (2000-1600 BC). &lt;br/&gt;Fine-grained radiocarbon dating of carbonized seeds will provide high precision chronologies for these sites. Coordinated analyses of stable isotopes from crop seeds, and animal bones and teeth will be used to estimate ancient rainfall and temperatures through time. Changing profiles of cultivated crops and herded animals will portray shifting human responses to environmental change. The analytical results from our four sites will be compared to infer trends of environmental change, both chronologically and geographically. Resulting trajectories of environmental change between 2500 and 1600 BC will be used to assess competing hypotheses to explain Levantine urban collapse. In sum, this research will contribute to the growing discussion of environmental dynamics at the heart of ancient social change with timely pertinence for human responses to environmental change in the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emotions result from making evaluations about the world while considering our future goals, past experiences, and current states. For example, humans have a basic need to connect with others, and emotions such as guilt can provide signals that help guide our behavior to meet these broader social goals by minimizing the negative impact of our actions on others. However, these internal experiences can currently only be subjectively assessed via introspection, which has limited our ability to understand how our brain generates these unique feelings and the overall consistency of these experiences across individuals. Through a series of studies, we will: (a) elicit feelings of guilt in participants tasked with making choices to reduce another person's suffering; (b) develop objective measures of these guilt experiences using computational models of facial expressions and brain activity; and (c) evaluate how these guilt experiences relate to other types of psychological processes such as perceiving guilt in others, remembering past experiences of guilt, and making decisions to harm others. This work has important implications for a number of consequential, emotional, and costly decisions that might impact others in a multitude of domains such as healthcare, politics, and business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal leverages computational techniques to identify objective measures of guilt experiences using brain patterns and facial expressions. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how guilt-aversion is a central motivation in making decisions to minimize harm to others and can be objectively measured by modelling patterns of brain activity. In Aim 2, we use these objective measures to better understand how guilt experiences relate to other types of psychological processes (perceiving, remembering, and imagining guilt). In Aim 3, we will examine if brain signals are uniquely able to capture signatures of guilt, or if these experiences can also be measured using patterns of facial expressions. This work provides a unique interdisciplinary approach to improve our understanding of guilt. First, we demonstrate our ability to successfully elicit guilt using a naturalistic social interaction and identify a common representation in a pattern of brain activity. This will allow us to perform construct validation on this measure to characterize how the experience of guilt relates to other related psychological experiences such as observing others in pain, recalling a previous guilty experience, or making decisions to harm others. Third, this proposal will evaluate whether guilt is uniquely encoded in brain signals, or if it might be manifested in other downstream signals such as patterns of facial expressions. If successful, this work might have a transformative impact on the field of emotion by overcoming the limitations of self-report in studying emotional experiences. This proposal can also provide important insight into evaluating the utility of alternative low-cost measurements to neuroimaging in capturing psychological experiences via facial expressions. Finally, this work could have implications for decision-making more broadly; our preferences for minimizing guilt may be so strong that they overwhelm the other costs associated with decision outcomes.  This proposal also incorporates synergistic educational training and outreach to broaden the work, including a new intensive summer training program; outreach to community service organizations; and new curriculum for undergraduate and medical students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will consider what specific socioeconomic conditions produced local ecological change doing this by comparing multiple centuries of written historical records documenting agriculture and land management with physical records of vegetation change reconstructed using sediments from nearby lakes. Combining ecologic data with historical texts permits identification of times when societal activities resulted in long-term environmental change. There is increasing recognition that modern ecosystems reflect the results of centuries of human and ecological processes. This project will offer insight into present-day decision makers charged with developing better strategies for responding to the challenges of living in a changing environment. The investigators will contribute to the advancement of science by applying a novel geochemical method to create a new and more detailed environmental history.

The McNair scholar program is a federal program for members of traditionally underrepresented groups in higher education to gain research skills and better prepare for a potential career in higher education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests the hypothesis that abrupt ecologic change is more closely associated with the history of human socioeconomic change than environmental change, and that these changes extend across broad geographic regions under the same governmental control. Ecologic change will be reconstructed using pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal analysis from radiocarbon dated lake sediment cores with very high sedimentation rates that allow for a decadal chronological resolution that can be compared with historical data. Historical narratives will come from extensive legal charters dating back to 650 AD. The investigators will also develop a new high-resolution precipitation reconstruction using a multi-method approach by analyzing oxygen and carbon isotopes from lake sediment carbonates and cellulose, analysis of hydrogen isotopes in leaf wax residues and testing whether carbon isotopes from pollen can be used as a precipitation proxy.

Using a variety of methods, the doctoral student will reconstruct and compare fire-climate-vegetation dynamics of the past century to those that have occurred over the past millennium.  The results of this project will reveal whether once-forested but now peat-accumulating sites are novel ecosystems, or whether such transitions have occurred in the past in these regions, possible due to drought conditions and fire frequencies that are similar to those observed today.  These results are of interest to land managers, who require tools to determine how best to manage altered ecosystems. By identifying whether (and which) ecological thresholds have been crossed, this project will provide crucial input for decision-making regarding best practices for land management.  The doctoral student will work closely with regional land managers and other stakeholders, including land owners and educators, to ensure that project results are available to inform collaborative land use decisions.  The PIs will also engage K-12 and college students in hands-on fieldwork, thus preparing future scientists to employ multiple lines of evidence in investigating the causes and consequences of environmental change.  In addition, as a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising graduate student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement project is to contribute to the scientific literature on alternative stable states that result from changes in the fire regimes of forested ecosystems.  Using methods from paleoecology, dendroecology, and community ecology, this research will examine fire-mediated effects on ecosystem structure at varying spatiotemporal scales at the peatland-forest ecotone, a transition zone that, like tree line, is particularly sensitive to changes in fire and climate.  The project addresses the following questions: (1) How has fire activity during post-European settlement periods with distinct climate conditions differed quantitatively from that of pre-settlement conditions?  (2) How has fire impacted the vegetation community of the forest-peatland ecotone during the most recent extreme warm/dry and cool/wet periods?  (3) What are the mechanisms that favor a transition from forested to peat-accumulating lands in a site?  Specifically, the doctoral student will use tree-ring fire scar dates, forest stand structure reconstructions, and sedimentary records to answer these questions.  In addition, surveys of present-day vegetation composition/structure at control and burned sites will be paired with those of abiotic and biotic factors to uncover the mechanisms underlying the persistence of the peat-accumulating state.  Although this project will focus on the forest-peatland ecotone of southwestern Patagonia, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with the interactive effects of environmental change in many other regions, including some in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to fabricate neuroelectric sensors and experimental protocols that would enable studying visual and higher level cognitive processes in the octopus while they are engaged in natural behaviors in an underwater environment. This will necessitate development of new engineering solutions for crafting electroencephalography (EEG) sensors that can record signal underwater, new solutions for removing noise artifacts from these highly complicated recordings, as well as careful design of experiments that could study such behaviors in a virtual-reality environment. While the brain of the octopus is very different from that of the human, it does support well-defined cognitive functions. Therefore, understanding whether and how octopuses' brains implement processes such as learning, attention, habituation, and surprise can produce new and important understandings of how neurobiological systems can support function.  This research might reveal that the neural substrates of cognitive function in the octopus are organized according to principles that differ drastically from those found in in humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project has several aims. It will develop the first underwater EEG, first testing well-validated paradigms on humans performing task underwater and benchmarking against known waveforms. The electrodes will be constructed so that they do not corrode in salt water. It will also develop high-quality virtual reality stimulation that could impact octopuses' behavior in an underwater environment. It will utilize EEG frequency-tagging techniques to determine processing of environmental stimulus by the octopus. This will allow studying whether octopuses present characteristic responses that are analogous to surprise, adaptation, working memory and attention effects (in primates and other vertebrates). The study will also allow answering how and in what manner do octopuses sleep. All data, artifacts and modeling software will be made publicly available and constitute an important resource for the community.

Yet, the Supreme Court has held that prosecutors are not required to disclose impeachment evidence to defendants at the plea stage of the process. This project will employ an experimental approach to test the Supreme Court's assumption that disclosure of impeachment evidence is not necessary to defendants. More particularly, the experiments will help determine whether the effect of disclosure on defense attorney decision making during plea bargaining differs as a function of evidence type, whether impeachment vs. exculpatory evidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to assess the impact of pre-plea disclosure of different types of evidence. To do so, the project will recruit a nationwide sample of practicing defense attorneys and present them with fictional case files. By experimentally manipulating participants' access to different types and amounts of impeachment and exculpatory evidence in mock plea-bargaining scenarios, the project will systematically test whether impeachment and exculpatory evidence function differently with respect to their effect on defense attorneys' plea-related decisions. The project employs the shadow of the trial theoretical framework, which posits that defense attorneys' plea-related recommendations are primarily based on their perceived odds of winning at trial. As pre-plea disclosure of evidence may affect defense attorneys' assessments of the chances of acquittal, access to exculpatory and impeachment evidence could play a role in a defense attorney's ability to accurate gauge their odds at trial. As a result, this project has implications for the application of Sixth Amendment rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research arena is an important theoretical and methodological marketplace where geneticists, biological anthropologists, paleoecologists, and archaeologists work to explain the process of global human dispersal. This is especially the case in the Americas, where genetic models predict that humans of the late Ice Age rapidly filled the Western Hemisphere, originating in greater Northeast Asia, spreading to Alaska, and reaching the Southern Cone of South America, between 24,000 and 12,000 calendar years ago. Archaeological evidence is required from these scattered regions to empirically test the genetic-based theory of how early hunter-gatherers dispersed. One of the most visible components of the archaeological record is the variable forms of weapons and projectile points that prehistoric hunters across northern Asia and America used, specifically stone lanceolate points versus bone/antler/ivory points, the latter sometimes inset with stone microblades. The functional, environmental, and social factors that influenced these weapon designs remain unknown. Why did ancient foragers of Siberia and Alaska employ different weapon systems as they entered the Americas? How did these variable weapons facilitate settlement of every ecological niche in the Western Hemisphere? The new research will offer insight into the use of major projectile-point technologies and human decision-making processes as early Americans dispersed through different environments, at the end of the Ice Age when dramatic climatic and ecological changes were taking place, broadening knowledge of human adaptability, especially in northern landscapes. The international context of the research will foster relationships between a new generation of American, Canadian, and Russian archaeologists investigating human behavioral change and adaptation in the circumpolar Arctic. The project will engage Alaskan Native communities through educational demonstrations of projectile systems traditionally used in subsistence activities, promoting positive relationships between archaeologists and the public. Understanding the functions of these important artifacts will help sustain traditional subsistence practices among Native Alaskans and will help reveal the reasons for ancient assemblage differences and ultimately how these differences relate to the colonization of Beringia and the Americas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joshua Lynch, PhD candidate at Texas A&amp;M University, will examine variability in projectile technologies Ice Age Siberia and Beringia by examining the range of morphological and functional variation in lithic, osseous, and composite points to test hypotheses explaining why different projectile technologies co-occur in the early archaeological record of the far north. This will be achieved through a series of experiments employing projectiles reflective of archaeological examples used in three different weapon systems (hand-thrust spear, bow and arrow, and spear thrower) to generate a new standard of breakage and use-wear patterns for ancient weapon technologies. By establishing the functions of specific point forms, project results will improve interpretations of Ice Age archaeological assemblage variability as it relates to foraging behavior, landscape use, site function, and cultural variability. Further, macro- and microscopic analyses of projectile points from more than 40 pivotal Siberian and Alaskan archaeological sites will be conducted and compared to the results of the experimental testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses the question: What ideas about fairness underpin an economic system that uses data about individuals and their past behavior to determine who gets what going forward? Economic sociologists have long studied how markets and the people who decide their contours, like business leaders and regulators, institutionalize certain understandings of good and bad, of legitimate and inappropriate. Over time, these ideas about how markets should operate become taken-for-granted assumptions that seem natural and obvious, but when market practices are new, these ideas are not yet settled on. By studying the big data economy in its early years, this project seeks to capture how certain ideas about market fairness are becoming accepted?and others are being left aside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand these dynamics, the project focuses on the case of car insurance pricing and leverages a series of U.S. policy debates to study how market actors?including companies, regulators, and consumers?morally frame the use of personal data in insurance pricing. The project also studies how different moral frames enable or deflect the use of various types of information, such as credit scores, social media posts, and real-time driving data. The project draws from policy and industry documents, in-depth interviews, and ethnographic observations at insurance conferences to analyze how different ways of construing fairness lead to different business practices and policy outcomes. To complement these data, the project includes a survey of American consumers to understand the moral intuitions of the people whose lives are affected by these policies and practices. With this analysis, the project contributes to economic sociology?s morals and markets literature and burgeoning efforts to understand the practices of mass data collection, predictive analytics, and algorithmic decision-making, which increasingly give markets their shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year, 50-80 patients at the CEC undergo intracranial electrode monitoring and surgical removal of brain tissue to treat medically refractory epilepsy.  The surgery involves making a small craniotomy in the skull and implanting electrodes in the brain that are used (1) to monitor neurophysiological brain activity during seizures and (2) to stimulate different regions of brain to understand their importance for cognitive, sensory and motor tasks. With this information, clinicians make informed decisions on what regions of the brain can be safely removed to treat the patients' epilepsy, while sparing critical functions. Having patients with electrodes temporarily implanted in their brain enables the unique opportunity to study both human cognition and epilepsy in a manner that is not possible with non-invasive tools such as brain imaging. With rapid improvements in electrode technology, the number of electrodes in each implanted device continues to grow and offers researchers even more detailed information about brain function in normal cognition and disease. To maximize the information available from each electrode, it needs to be independently connected to a stimulation and recording system. At present, the clinical system at the CEC cannot support the total number of electrodes in both clinical and research devices, leading to compromises in the research data.  Moreover, some newer electrode technologies are not compatible with the current system. Thus, valuable information is lost. This award will enable the CEC to purchase a piece of equipment that has the capacity to measure from and stimulate 512 isolated electrode channels, ensuring no information is lost and bearing the promise of a more detailed and complete understanding of brain function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYU has built an incredibly productive research program around the human intracranial electrode patient population. Research is broadly focused on understanding language, memory, sleep, and epilepsy in the human brain. While the clinical value of the research is clear, the work also provides insight into the ""normal"" functioning of the human brain and thus falls within the scope of NSF supported science. For example, scientists working with the CEC have been able to provide deep insight into questions such as how language is processed by the brain and how memories are formed and subsequently strengthened during sleep. The intracranial research program at the CEC is highly collaborative and involves partnerships with scientists and clinicians across NYU as well as at multiple research institutes around the country. Patients are engaged in sensory, cognitive, and motor tasks and researchers measure activity in the brain to understand the neural basis of cognition. This award will not only expand the amount of information researchers can measure from a single patient, but also enable them to stimulate and perturb the brain during task performance to uncover causal brain-behavior relationships previously inaccessible in humans. Moreover, the technical expertise and interests of the collaborative group of researchers working with the CEC span a wide range and include non-invasive neuroimaging in humans and novel electrode technologies in animals. The capability to compare many channels of human intracranial recording with cross-species electrophysiological recordings in animal models will expand capabilities for translational research and accelerate the pace at which medical technology develops in the lab and can be brought to the bedside to improve clinical care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the fastest growing of such groups are Asian American and Latinx people. As members of minority groups, Asian American and Latinx people frequently experience discrimination and prejudice.  Many decades of research in the social and behavioral sciences has made significant progress in understanding the nature of such discrimination, its harmful consequences, and how policies and practices can be shaped to reduce those harmful effects. This body of theory and research has helped to develop a much better understanding of the many forms of discrimination, and how racial minorities respond to discrimination. Yet the vast majority of this work is based on the Black-White relationship in the U.S. and the specific experiences of African American people. As a result, the unique forms of discrimination faced by Asian American and Latinx people may be overlooked and poorly recognized by those in power. This is important to understand because policies and practices that are meant to remedy forms of discrimination may actually be harmful to the health and success of some people of color in the U.S. This project seeks to refine basic understanding of discrimination in a way that more fully accounts for the forms of discrimination experienced by Asian American and Latinx people, which can ultimately improve the productivity, health, and welfare for all of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses large-scale audit studies and controlled laboratory experiments to investigate whether racial and ethnic minority groups face different forms of discrimination. The research considers the implications that different forms of discrimination have on the likelihood of reporting discrimination, and how different strategies may be required to reduce discrimination based on which racial and ethnic group is targeted. The project offers a conceptual refinement by distinguishing two dimensions of social stereotypes: perceived inferiority and cultural foreignness. By systematically integrating these two dimensions, new insight will be gained into the distinct forms of discrimination faced by groups who have less-frequently been the focus of theory and research in this area. The research investigates whether Asian American and Latinx people face more discrimination in the labor market than do White and African American people for jobs that require stereotypical American characteristics (e.g., English language abilities). The project also examines whether discrimination based on cultural foreignness is likely to be unrecognized as discrimination by those in power. Experiments also consider unique strategies used by Asian American and Latinx people to cope with these forms of discrimination. Understanding the varying forms of discrimination faced by different racial and ethnic minority groups is a critical step in recognizing, attending to, and eventually eliminating these forms of discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds lag far behind their more advantaged peers in an essential component of psychological reasoning, false-belief understanding. This is troubling because psychological reasoning is vital for navigating everyday life, and deficits in this skill could have serious negative consequences for the intellectual, social, and moral development of disadvantaged children, as well as their long-term well-being. This project will substantially advance understanding of how and why economic inequality influences children's psychological reasoning.

The findings could inform interventions designed to enhance psychological reasoning skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there is considerable evidence for an economic disparity in false-belief understanding, the nature of this disparity is unclear because prior studies have used a single type of paradigm that children could fail for many reasons. To address this issue, a sample of socioeconomically diverse preschool children will complete multiple types of false-belief paradigms that target different facets of false-belief understanding, including several novel paradigms that have not previously been used to examine this disparity. Patterns of associations between socioeconomic status and task performance will be used to characterize the underlying nature of the socioeconomic disparity in false-belief understanding. Few studies have examined the mechanism by which socioeconomic status affects false-belief understanding, and thus little is known about the cause of this disparity. This project will test the hypothesis that this disparity arises via socioeconomic effects on parent-child interactions. Specifically, the researchers predict that less stressed and more knowledgeable parents will use more terms that refer to mental states such as ""think"" and ""know"".

The team has already uncovered important facts about the distribution of mortgage debt and defaults in the years before and during the crisis that suggest that the real cause of the crisis was not subprime mortgages, but rather real estate investors. The team will therefore carry out a comprehensive study of the role of real estate investors during these years. The research will develop and test theories about how credit supply, housing demand, and expectations about housing prices affected investor behavior. The team will also analyze the effects of the mortgage crisis on people who were young adults during the crisis years. Tighter mortgage standards have made it harder for these families to purchase housing, while at the same time these young households have much higher student debt. This part of the research will measure the longer-run effects of the mortgage crisis on these young American families. The results of the project will help us understand the pros and cons of regulations affecting mortgage and housing markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research makes important contributions to the scientific understanding of housing and mortgage markets. It offers a comprehensive study of real estate investors. This class of borrowers has been overlooked in previous research because they are hard to identify in the data and because it is difficult to incorporate real estate investment in equilibrium models of the housing market. The results will help us understand whether investor activity affects fluctuations in house prices and will also demonstrate whether or not current credit scoring models adequately capture the default risk of investor mortgages.  The research also gives us new insights on the long-term implications of the 2007-2009 crisis. Given the permanent effect of initial conditions on labor market outcomes, and the tight relation between the life cycle path of income and debt, we would expect lower lifetime earnings and mortgage balances for workers who first entered the labor market close to the crisis relative to previous cohorts. Two aggravating factors amplify this effect. First, based on the misplaced emphasis on subprime borrowers, low credit score households were all but excluded from mortgage markets, which especially hurt the young. Additionally, young households held unprecedentedly high levels of student debt in this period. This was driven by rising tuition, but also by the loss in net worth experienced by parents as a result of the crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will contribute to a general understanding of how science shapes and is shaped by larger national political and economic initiatives.  The project includes integrated educational activities such as the development of a public exhibit; the creation of a web-based learning module available to anyone interested in this material; the training of undergraduate and graduate students in conducting historic-geographic research; and community engagement.  Societal outcomes from these projects include contributing to the education and training of minority students for careers in agriculture and other sciences, and promoting broader public understanding of the contributions of racial and ethnic minorities to U.S. science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the case of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s early tropical plant exploration and experimentation, this study brings the American tropics into the analyses of science, foreign policy, and American frontier settlement. The project will theoretically and empirically advance several fields of inquiry including geographies of science, black geographies, political ecology, and historical geography. It will produce new knowledge about African Diasporic contributions to agricultural and botanical sciences and about the influences of racial stereotypes on historical agricultural development.  Specifically the study's objectives are: 1) to review and analyze USDA scientists' practices of tropical plant collection, experimentation, and introduction; 2) to understand the role of the USDA's tropical plant exploration and introduction efforts in constructing Florida's tropical region as a desirable space for white settlement; and 3) to analyze how nineteenth and early twentieth-century interlinked ideas of race, U.S. empire, and scientific knowledge shaped and were shaped by the USDA's tropical plant projects. Using both archived materials and published historical documents the investigator will analyze the representational and embodied practices of key individuals and the policies and politics of their associated institutions. The historical period under investigation begins with the USDA's move toward overseas exploration and plant importation, around 1890, and ends in 1945 when the geopolitical context of US foreign policy shifted significantly.

How these organizations operate and how to combat them is a major frontier of political science, economics, criminology and public policy. Around the world, hundreds of millions of people live under the armed rule of criminal groups. These groups pose a major threat to governments, regional stability and the U.S. homeland. Yet we know relatively little about the organization of business and life under this armed rule. This is partly because criminal governance is often hiding in plain sight, in slums and urban peripheries where state forces can go but rarely establish a continual presence. This study aims to understand this entire criminal ecosystem by means of large-sample qualitative interviews with high-, mid- and low-ranking gang members, quantitative data collection on criminal groups, and experimental interventions with criminal gangs. This study also promotes training and scholarship by involving several post-doctoral and pre-doctoral students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses critical gaps in knowledge: how are urban criminal groups structured, how and why do they govern civilians, and how can authorities crowd them out? In Medellin, Colombia most poor- and middle-income neighborhoods are governed by criminal gangs. More than 300 local gangs resolve disputes, police and prevent crime, manage legal and illegal markets, and tax businesses. Above these local gangs lie roughly a dozen mafia-like organizations. These groups have developed complex hierarchies and rules to regulate crime, minimize conflict, and govern. By studying this entire criminal ecosystem, this project takes advantage of a unique, large-N setting to generate knowledge about criminal organization and governance. Unlike traditional case studies of single gangs or mafias, this study leverages the large number of armed groups in Medellin to develop more generalizable theory and findings through a three-pronged design that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods: (i) a qualitative study of the internal organization and external governance of dozens of gangs, through large-sample and multi-year interviews, with high-, mid- and low-ranking criminal members; (ii) primary and observational data collection, designed to measure variation in internal organization and external governance of hundreds of gangs; and (iii) the first of several experimental anti-gang interventions, beginning with one designed to understand and reduce criminal governance. This study will also have a broader impact on different dimensions by testing a locally-developed, non-militarized strategy; it could be used in similar contexts across Latin America. Moreover, it demonstrates that it is feasible to experiment on gang policy with rigor and scale, and spur further ethical experimentation in combating armed groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Warfare and violence between civilizations of diverse religious and cultural backgrounds continue to shape the societies immersed in these antagonistic interactions. By looking to the past, archaeology has the ability to reveal complex examples of ancient aggression, giving insight into the long-term effects of large-scale and endemic violence on human societies. While it would be easy to focus on the negative aspects of warfare, which are prevalent and varied, there are also contexts in which warfare has acted as a stimulus for cultural florescence. The present project builds upon the sensational discovery of multi thousand new ancient Maya structures in the Guatemalan jungle, detected by laser-based, lidar remote sensing technology, to investigate just such a case. The multi-layered conflicts seen between Maya city-states, as well as contemporary foreign cultures, are reminiscent of the complex conflicts that affect different areas of the globe today, and archaeology can inform upon the long-term societal impacts caused by these clashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Garrison and his team will focus their investigations on the newly discovered, ancient fortress of La Cuernavilla. Situated between the great Maya city-state of Tikal and the smaller neighboring kingdom of El Zotz, the fortress appears to date to the late 4th century; the very beginnings of Classic Maya civilization (AD 300-900). Preliminary studies indicate a link between La Cuernavilla and the foreign, central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, which invaded and conquered Tikal in AD 378. Using a combination of archaeological, environmental, and chemical analyses the researchers will conduct field and laboratory investigations to unpack the complex cultural milieu present at La Cuernavilla and in its surrounding landscape. Studies of local environmental conditions in the past, as well as available ancient dietary resources will show to what degree the site was a true fortress, able to withstand long-term attacks and advance a political and military agenda. Archaeological investigations will discern the complex cultural sequence that involves two Maya cities at war during the time of a foreign occupation. These analyses and comparisons with other case studies will be used to interpret to what degree places like La Cuernavilla contributed to the rise of cultural complexity and the florescence of Maya civilization, hopefully serving as a model for understanding similar situations across time and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because surveys are so widely used, it is essential that we establish a knowledge base about the measurement quality of survey data and the attributes of questions that produce the best data. Science well understands the reliability of multi-item measures, or scales, commonly used in such research.  But we know much less about the quality of single-item survey questions. New data resources and modeling strategies now make it possible to assess the reliability or consistency of measurement for these survey measures. Based on statistical models for evaluating reliability of measurement, this project draws upon the insights from the information gathering process in surveys. The results of this research will provide practical suggestions that will improve the quality of survey data, thus improving survey research generally. The project will develop a publicly available website to allow all survey researchers to investigate question reliability of a large number of commonly used survey questions.  Because surveys are used broadly by science, government and the private sector to inform many policy and economic decisions, improved information about survey measures will contribute to the health and well being of U. S. society across multiple sectors and over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because surveys are so widely used, it is essential that we establish a knowledge base about the measurement quality of survey data and the attributes of questions that produce the best results. In order to accomplish these aims, this project develops a set of meta-data containing information for roughly 1200 single-item questions representative of typical questions used in social science surveys. The database of survey questions, developed on the basis of ten nationally (or regionally) representative panel studies including the General Social Surveys, the Health and Retirement Study, the National Election Studies, contains estimates of question-specific reliabilities, along with detailed coding of attributes of the questions, such as their content, response formats, and question length, which can be used to evaluate the optimal properties of survey questions with respect to levels of measurement error. Through an analysis of the reliability information and the attributes of survey questions from these large-scale panel studies, the study focuses on three major elements of questionnaire construction: content, context and form. Statistical analysis will involve use of auto-regressive or Quasi-Markov simplex modeling techniques. The resulting meta-data set will be archived with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and other suitable data archives. In addition, the project will post key elements of these data on a publicly available website, along with images of questions and question context involved, in a manner that allows users to search, filter or query the data base in investigating the reliability of types of survey questions of interest. These findings will contribute important information to the multidisciplinary field of survey methodology, which informs scholars in disciplines including sociology, political science, economics, communication, psychology, law, public health, and public policy, as well as actors in the private and governmental sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This theory can be used to analyze a wide variety of economic problems, including financial crises and business cycles. While the standard coordination game approach offers insight into these settings, it allows multiple equilibria and thus does not offer a complete theory in the absence of a theory of equilibrium selection. In response, a global games approach has been widely used in applied economics. By assuming noisy information about payoffs, one can remove the multiplicity of equilibria and develop a wide variety of predictions that can then be tested against data. However, there are a number of important limitations to the global games approach. The four components of this research proposal address four different limitations. The components are relevant for all global game applications, but are developed in the context of applications in macroeconomics, political economy and finance.  The project therefore contributes to developing new theories and methods that can help individuals, businesses, and policymakers at all levels of government make better decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global game analysis has made extreme informational assumptions: there is common knowledge of payoffs and multiple equilibria, or small noise and globally unique equilibria. The project has four components, each designed to address one aspect of these assumptions. The first component examines richer classes of information structures to develop novel predictions about when global game predictions arise. Global game analysis has been primarily static. The second component examines dynamic environments with learning to develop predictions about when global game predictions occur. Global game analysis has focused on binary action games. The third component analyzes a political economy application where feasible set of available actions is itself a choice variable, and characterizes when the action set is or is not binary. Global game analysis has mostly relied on simple analytic solutions to deliver qualitative insights. The fourth component develops a finance application with a rich set of heterogeneous players in order to develop quantitative framework that that can be used in empirical work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These people are the first source of information as children begin to learn about human behavior and social norms shaping that behavior. The goal of this study is to examine how contextual factors influence the manner in which children interpret the behavioral intentions of others.  With a focus on social-cognitive development, this study addresses how children learn about the goals and desires of others and how children learn about the rules and norms of various social groups. In this global age, individuals are increasingly required to understand multiple worldviews. This study will foster skills needed to promote positive social behaviors and sensitivity to the norms and values of different cultural groups in the United States, which, in turn, will reduce harmful stereotyping and misunderstandings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the perspectives, norms, and conventions of various individuals will help children develop a better understanding of their own place in the social world. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the process by which children acquire this understanding.  The study also examines cultural differences and similarities in how children interpret intentional actions over the first five years of life. This will be accomplished by tracking emerging developmental changes in understandings of personal and social causes of intentional action at three time points starting in infancy and continuing on to the preschool years. Two cultural groups will be compared: European- and Chinese-Americans. The study also involves examining how infants, toddlers, and preschoolers employ statistical learning mechanisms in interpreting behavior.  The methodological approach consists of a critical third party generalization task; this means that having learned about the behaviors (and intentions) of one person, investigators will determine whether infants and children are able to predict the behaviors (and intentions) of an unfamiliar person.  A statistical learning measure will be used to determine how infants and children across cultures use statistical information to infer goals and desires of individuals. For example, if a young child grows up in a culture in which actions are governed by common cultural norms and practices as opposed to personal preferences, and thus observes consistency across individuals, that child may learn, over time, that observed intentional actions are frequently generalizable across individuals. In contrast, if a young child grows up in a culture in which actions are frequently expressions of idiosyncratic personal tastes, and thus, observes variability across individuals, then, that child may learn over time that intentional actions are not necessarily generalizable across individuals. Three age groups will be assessed: infants (ages 11-13 months), toddlers (ages 28-32 months) and preschoolers (ages 3-5 years).  Central questions posed include: Are children's predictions regarding the intentions of others a function of the sociocultural group to which the children belong?

The researcher has chosen these research sites because Chile has one of the most segregated systems of education of all developed countries, which makes it feasible to isolate the effects of schooling in a way that would not be possible in a system with more institutional crossover. The researcher will use the intensive methods from linguistic anthropology to collect data on voice and embodied gesture in naturally occurring interactions during classroom and extracurricular activities. Data will be collected through participant observation, interviews, and audiovisual recordings, identifying students at different points in their school careers. She will construct visual representations of pitch tracks, to accompany transcriptions of speech and representations of embodied movement, using a method for visual and textual representation of multimodal semiotic channels in interaction.

Scientific progress is advanced when diverse scholars participate in its production. To further this mission, the RDCJN undertakes two primary activities: coordinating an annual Summer Research Institute (SRI) for early-career faculty from underrepresented groups; and hosting an annual conference that brings together scholars of race, crime and justice to further a comprehensive research agenda and undertake collaborative projects. The SRI expands diverse participation in STEM fields in an area with significant underrepresentation of minority scholars: the American Society of Criminology reports a membership that is just 5.6 percent African American, 5.1 percent Latino/a, 5.8 percent Asian, and 1 percent American Indian. In 12 years, the SRI has hosted 90 young scholars, who are publishing and consistently gaining tenure. Strengthening our understanding of crime and justice outcomes requires bringing the unique perspectives and methods of underrepresented groups to bear on these issues, thus enhancing democratization of the academy. The annual RDCJN workshops integrate the SRI faculty into a national network of scholars, while also facilitating progress in the interdisciplinary study of race/ethnicity, crime and justice. To date, RDCJN collaborations have produced nine volumes of innovative scholarship on this topic, as well as numerous monographs and articles in leading journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable eight assistant professors from underrepresented groups to spend three weeks on-site at the Rutgers University School of Criminal Justice per grant year, during which time they are partnered with a senior faculty mentor in their topical and methodological area to facilitate the finalization of a journal article, grant proposal, or book manuscript. The Principal Investigators and other prominent scholars will hold professional development workshops on publishing, career planning, and navigating the academy. The annual RDCJN workshop occurs during the last two days of the SRI, at which time the SRI Fellows will present their research and receive feedback from a national network of scholars, integrate into the larger Network, and join and contribute to a comprehensive, collaborative research agenda. Project efforts foster the careers of young scholars from underrepresented groups, ensure their integration and success in the academy, and integrate them in a Network of scholars undertaking innovative crime and justice research.

Non-business travel contributed $7.6 trillion dollars to the global economy and $500 billion dollars to the United States economy in 2016. However, for some communities, heritage travel can be a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it promises needed economic support and cultural preservation. Yet, these economic opportunities may require sometimes demeaning commodification and standardization of local identities. Understanding why people participate in heritage travel and the strategies they use to channel its opportunities productively, will inform programs and policies to represent more justly the diverse economic, social, and cultural interests of local communities in the United States.

To understand the relationship between Gullah Geechees and the emergent heritage travel industry, the Co-PI will focus on the following questions: What are the performative strategies (such as, branding, aesthetics, historical narratives) used by Gullah Geechees for identification in heritage entrepreneurship? What factors shape how Gullah Geechees participate in initiatives surrounding their cultural heritage? The research will also investigate how African-American travelers and visitors from Africa, as well as national, state, and local political authorities influence the contexts of heritage travel in which Gullah Geechees participate.

Older adults face complicated financial and healthcare decisions, which carry substantial consequences for themselves and for their families. It is therefore of high concern that older adults make more financial mistakes compared to their younger counterparts, and that they are increasingly subjected to exploitation by the people around them. A crucial aspect of most of these decisions is that they are made under conditions of high uncertainty. Shifts in behavior under uncertainty may therefore underlie some of the changes in decision making in aging. The cognitive and motivational bases for these shifts, however, are largely unknown. Understanding these bases is important, because it may  guide the development of individually-tailored decision aids. This project aims to characterize age-related changes in uncertainty attitudes in the financial and medical domains, and to determine whether these depend on age-related changes in learning from feedback and in sensitivity to rewards and punishments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our world is highly uncertain and rapidly changing. Individuals vary substantially in their attitudes towards uncertainty: some seek it, while others avoid it at all costs. An important factor that affects individual uncertainty attitudes is age, yet age-related changes are not uniform, but rather they are context-dependent. This suggests that uncertainty attitudes result from interactions between several context-dependent processes. The studies conducted in this project test the general hypothesis that individual differences in decision traits are linked to differences in basic cognitive and motivational processes, and that age-related changes in these basic processes account for age-related changes in decision traits. Specifically, the studies will test the contribution of three basic processes to uncertainty attitudes: the ability to reduce uncertainty by learning from feedback, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to punishments. The researchers will test this hypothesis in a group of cognitively healthy individuals between the ages of 18 and 90, using two behavioral tasks and one functional MRI task. The behavioral tasks will evaluate: (1) individual attitudes towards uncertainty in multiple domains (money gains, money losses and medical treatments), and (2) individual ability to flexibly learn from feedback. Functional neuroimaging will be used to measure neural responses to anticipated rewards and punishments. Resting-state fMRI will also be measured, to evaluate age-related changes in functional connectivity between brain areas that are involved in valuation, learning and choice. All collected data will be deposited in an open platform for neuroimaging data for public use by other investigators. The proposed work will lead to a detailed understanding of the role of learning, as well as reward and punishment processing, in individual uncertainty attitudes, and age-related changes in these attitudes. This understanding will provide constraints for future research on the neural basis of decision making, as well as policy making and decision aids for older adults. It will also serve as the basis for longitudinal and patient studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process of domestication is essential for producing nutritious foods that can be grown, harvested, stored and eaten.  It is an interactive process, with humans transporting and cultivating desirable species, thus creating the base of the food chain and a great diversity of plant forms.  The common potato, for example, was domesticated over 7,000 years ago in the high Andes and is now the third most important crop in the world, comprising over 4,500 varieties.  And although domestication has occurred and been studied in hundreds of species, only a few plants native to North America were ever domesticated and none of those are from west of the Mississippi.  Recent evidence, however, suggests that a novel potato species, known as the Four Corners Potato (Solanum jamesii Torr.) was manipulated by ancient people sometime during the last 12,000 years. The tubers might have been an important food and energy source because of their nutritional qualities, reliable productivity and ability to persist in the soil. Furthermore, populations of this species now occupy atypical habitats among and within the great pueblos of the Southwest, evidence that indigenous farming practices included this species. Therefore, a collaborative archaeological and biological approach is well-suited to provide insight on the initial stages (use, transport and manipulation) in the domestication process. In the broader context, detecting these stages will challenge understanding of foraging strategies and a long-established scientific paradigm regarding agricultural origins and food choices among hunter-gatherers in North America by identifying the Four Corners as a hitherto unknown center of plant domestication. There are no other places in North America that can claim such a long heritage with a local food.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Lisbeth Louderback, Natural History Museum of Utah (University of Utah) and Dr. Bruce Pavlik, Red Butte Garden and Arborteum (University of Utah), along with colleagues at the USDA Potato Genebank, Ohio Northern University, and Utah Din Bikyah, will test the hypothesis that tubers of a native potato (Solanum jamesii Torr.) were used, transported, and manipulated sometime during the Holocene in the American Southwest.  Use will be characterized by examining the microscopic residues of potato starch that persist on groundstone tools from archaeological sites in the Four Corners region.  Genetic and population techniques will be used to identify the unique signatures of transport from one place to another in the ancient world.  The evidence for possible manipulation will be gathered using chemical and physiological analyses, in addition to genetic markers, to detect selection for taste, cold tolerance and the loss of tuber dormancy.  Finally, the fading traditions of the Four Corners potato, kept alive into the 21st Century by the very last generation of knowledgeable stewards, will be documented. Tended only in a few fields by Native Americans and pioneer descendants, this project hopes to generate a new interest and a new sense of stewardship for this remarkable plant species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prime example concerns how childbirth occurs in the U.S, as more families seek alternatives to standard hospital-based, obstetrician-attended medicated birth, such as home birth. Certified Professional Midwives, the professional providers specifically trained to provide care to the growing community of families choosing home birth, are regulated by enormously varied laws and policies. This project will investigate the legal setting of home birth midwifery in the context of varied communities of practice and their responses to differing regulatory frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using mixed-methods to analyze the inconsistent legal environment of home birth, the project will employ an ethnographic approach, including in-depth interviews and analysis of archival data collected across varied jurisdictional contexts. The study will investigate responses to a lack of stability about state treatment of expertise that characterizes the regulatory context of home birth. The research design includes participant observation centered around the practices of home birth professionals in several field sites. Ethnographic research will be supplemented by interviews with officials charged with regulating the practice of home birth midwifery and with other members of the professional networks of home birth midwives. Findings will contribute to an understanding of the relationship between legal consciousness, regulatory arrangements, and the politics of expertise and professionalization. Additionally, the project will provide implications of existing regulatory strategies by illuminating how practitioners respond to the various models of licensure currently in use across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.  Using a multidisciplinary methodological approach, this study of Asian populations will meaningfully quantify proportional differences resulting from environmental variables in a way not possible with previous ecogeographic methods.  Standard skeletal measurements and landmarks will be collected to allow for comparisons across geographic regions as well as further examination of variation in the size and shape of the face, cranial vault, and birth canal between the sexes and populations. The analyses will account for the potential influence of nonadaptive forces such as drift and migration on body form by pairing skeletal measurements with appropriately matched genetic data and local weather station information for statistical analysis.  Linear mixed effects models testing for evidence of adaptation due to environmental factors will contain both head and body data of male and female individuals from each population.

Children's early experiences lay the groundwork for long-term brain development. This is particularly clear in the context of early life stress (ELS), which alters neural circuits involved in learning and self-regulation during adolescence. Identifying biological sequelae that follow ELS exposure and contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes is a pressing scientific priority given that ELS exposure poses significant risks to cognitive and emotional development. The immune system presents itself as a promising biological mechanism by which ELS impacts long-term neurodevelopment because it is highly sensitive to early experiences and has strong bidirectional connections with the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Psychoneuroimmunological Effects of Early Life Stress Study will test for links between ELS exposure, inflammatory processes, and neurodevelopment across a 2-year period in adolescence.

It will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the development of two distinct prefrontal-subcortical circuits involved in learning about threats and self-regulation. Longitudinal data will be collected from a group of adopted adolescents who experienced institutional orphanage care as infants--a severe form of ELS--as well as a group of never-institutionalized adolescents. The researcher will test the hypothesis that inflammatory processes promote brain development relevant for learning about threats and disrupt brain development relevant for regulating emotional responses to threats in ELS-exposed adolescents. Pro-inflammatory gene expression will be tested as a mediator between ELS and (a) increased prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during threat learning, and (b) diminished prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during self-regulation.

Understanding the acoustic details of these sound waves can help improve voice recognition technologies and provide insight on language differences which can potentially aid in language learning. A large body of work in linguistics and related disciplines has shown that speakers do not always pronounce sounds in the same way. For example, the sound ""p"" in English will be pronounced differently in different contexts (beginning of a word vs. end of word) and at different times simply because talkers are humans. People do not usually hear these differences, but they are present in the acoustics and can be measured. Variation in speech is natural and happens in every language. However, less is known about exactly how much variation occurs in different languages. This research seeks to address this gap by investigating whether speakers of some languages have more variable pronunciation than speakers of other languages and what might explain the difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One frequently assumed hypothesis says that speakers of languages with more sounds will show less variation (be more precise) when they pronounce those sounds. The researchers will gather data from different languages to test and  revise this hypothesis. They will also develop concrete methods for measuring acoustic variability in language which can then be applied to future work. The experiments compare stop sounds in Hindi (""b"", ""bh"", ""p"" and ""ph"") and English (""b"" and ""p""), and sibilant sounds in Polish (""s"", ""&amp;#347;"", and ""sz"") and French (""s"" and ""sh""). Both experiments examine multiple acoustic cues to the contrasts in each language. The second portion of the project will use the conclusions from these experiments to investigate whether speakers imitate the variability of other speakers that they hear. It is well documented that speakers change their pronunciation based on speech they have recently heard, but it is not known whether speakers will change the amount of variability in their speech based on what they have heard. To address this question, the researchers will carry out an imitation study where speakers listen to speech before being prompted to speak to see if the variability in their speech changes after listening. The results of these studies will increase understanding of variability in pronunciation across different languages and contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will evaluate the complex effects of work, including the absence of regular or meaningful work, on personality trait development in young adults. The results of this research will show what skills are needed to find a job and to succeed in the workplace, and provide valuable information about the effects of unemployment and underemployment on personality development. This information will help policy makers identify potential interventions that can aid underemployed workers in becoming more competitive for full-time permanent positions. Results from this project may be especially helpful to colleges and universities as they strive to promote successful transitions from college to the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will conduct a multi-wave longitudinal study of close to 1,000 graduating seniors from a large Midwestern university who are entering the workforce.

Annual surveys will then be administered for two additional years to obtain longer-term information about personality trait change, workplace experiences, and the effects of unemployment or underemployment. Personality traits will be assessed at each time point using both self- and informant-reports. In addition, information will also be gathered about participant work experiences, perceived fit and engagement with their jobs, and investment in family and community activities.

Conventional wisdom in political science indicates that power-sharing institutions can foster loyalty to the state among certain target groups, such as ethnic minority citizens. However, existing studies have found inconclusive evidence. Additionally, existing research has yet to identify mechanisms linking power-sharing and attachment to the state. This research seeks to address these gaps. Based on an original dataset of household survey and qualitative interviews with local residents and civil servants, it examines power-sharing at the local level of government. Its contribution to the literature lies in a careful tracing and elucidation of the interactions between the target citizens and the state via its agents (the civil servants) and how these interactions shape citizens' view of and attachment to government. This work will inform policymakers that the way in which public service is delivered in a micro-level interaction between citizens and local agents of the state has consequential implications for the way some residents view government institutions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project seeks to answer to the following questions: (1) what shapes ethnic minority citizens' sense of attachment to the state?, and (2) why has the state been more successful in winning over a sense of attachment from members of some ethnic minority groups than other groups? To answer these questions, it takes a multi-method approach and uses an original dataset, consisting of household survey data and ethnic minority groups' actual level of representation at various levels of government. It proposes to test a set of hypotheses through regression analysis, and builds on existing literature on power-sharing, but takes a novel approach that focuses on power-sharing at the local -- rather than national -- level of government. Empirically, it goes well beyond showing correlation between the dependent and independent variables of interest; it estimates the effect of power-sharing with ethnic minorities at the national, regional, and local levels of government on their attachment to the state and addresses why and how the effects occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second project examines how businesses that share a supply chain make strategic decisions about pricing. The third project considers the economics of network coordination. When individuals seek to match their actions or opinions to those held by their friends and neighbors, what properties of the group determine whether or not disagreement will persist?  The fourth project studies the formation of networks for collaboration. The model gives new implications for how to build successful teams from diverse populations.

The first project analyzes a new model of rational individuals learning from their social contacts. It asks what network structures allow agents to form accurate beliefs about a changing world, and which ones lead to persistent errors. The second project studies a pricing problem in which firms interact strategically because they are part of the same supply chain and their prices affect each other's markets. The PI takes a network perspective on the strategic relationships and analyzes interventions in the market aimed, for example, at improving consumer welfare. The third project considers the basic welfare economics of network coordination. When individuals seek to match their actions or opinions to those of their network contacts, what properties of the group?s preferences determine the costs of miscoordination or disagreement? Which networks sustain strong polarization? The fourth project studies the formation of networks for collaboration, e.g. by students in school. Since the topics of the projects have proved to be of interest to applied researchers, the theoretical advances should have spillover benefits to other parts of economics. In several of the projects, a key aim is to provide empirically relevant summary statistics (e.g., measures of price pass-through, or segregation) for use in applied research.

Experimental evidence shows that employers prefer those with clean records, and that persons of color with records are particularly discriminated against. While much is known about employer hiring preferences, little is known about whether applicants with criminal records avoid or prefer particular employers. In other words, individuals with criminal records may not even apply to certain positions due to perceived low odds of getting the job or because they fear being stigmatized by employers in the application process. Employment is one of the most critical bonds for preventing a return to crime. If individuals elect not to apply for certain positions, such choices will decrease the odds of forming this important bond. Understanding under what conditions individuals with records choose to apply for jobs is therefore central to efforts to help individuals reintegrate into society and prevent crime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research project will interview 140 individuals with criminal records recruited from criminal reentry organizations and halfway houses in the Columbus, OH metropolitan area. An interview guide and brief survey were developed through a pilot study completed in 2017. In-depth interviews will provide nuanced information regarding job search experiences and choices. The interviews query topics such as experiences with job searches both before and after having a criminal record, whether criminal records questions or background check statements on job applications prevent individuals from applying for positions, how forthcoming individuals are about their record in the application process, and what types of industries they seek out. The survey gathers complementary information on socio-demographics, criminal history, employment history, and personal difficulties in applying for jobs. Respondents will be re-interviewed six months later in order to understand whether new experiences in the labor market alter choices among those with records, whether this differs by background factors related to labor market outcomes such as race, and the underlying reasons for any changes in choices such as those related to stigma. This project directly addresses ongoing public policy debates regarding how best to provide individuals with criminal records a fair assessment in the job application process so that they can experience the benefits of the important social bond of employment, best epitomized by the Ban the Box movement (which seeks to eliminate criminal record questions from job applications).

The longstanding notion that common property resources are effectively managed only through state control or private property regimes has been refuted time and again by anthropological and historical case studies demonstrating how social groups ranging from small communities to nation-states have devised effective systems of resource management, some of which endure for long periods of time. However, the manner in which common property institutions develop and change over time is poorly understood. As a result, researchers also lack the ability to reliably predict how existing regimes may change with respect to future perturbations in natural and social environments.&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Pluckhahn and Thompson, along with a team of graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar, will study changes in sea tenure?the collectively-managed use rights to fisheries?among the native societies of the Tampa Bay estuary during the late Holocene, from around AD 250 to 1650. Spanish accounts from the end of this time range describe a fractured socio-political landscape comprised of warring, territorially-based chiefdoms, while archaeological evidence from the earlier range of the time frame suggests a more dispersed population with less social stratification and little inter-group conflict. The research tests the hypothesis that this transformation was the result of changes in sea tenure occurring in conjunction with shifts in the natural and social environments, through a program of archaeological and paleoecological testing. For the reconstruction of ancient systems of sea tenure, the research employs isotopic studies of oyster shells in concert with the analysis of the relative abundance of shellfish species with varying salinity tolerances, to model habitat of collection. To reconstruct the local and regional manifestations of global shifts in climate, the researchers will collect pollen and sediments from wetlands adjacent to archaeological sites. Changes in socio-political organization will be identified through a program of archaeological testing and shallow geophysics at mound and village complexes.

To help evaluate whether new and existing regulations enhance national welfare, government policies require comparing estimates of the monetary value of the life-saving and other benefits with the costs of the regulations. The monetary value of reductions in mortality risk is usually estimated using one of two approaches. One approach, common in transportation and environmental regulation, estimates the annual monetary benefits as the product of a ""value per statistical life"" (VSL) and the expected number of ""lives saved"" per year. The second approach, common in food-safety and drug regulation, estimates the benefits as the product of a ""value per statistical life year"" (VSLY) and the average increase in life expectancy. Because life expectancy depends on mortality risk at all future ages, this second approach assumes that individuals assign the same monetary value to any time path of risk reduction that produces the same gain in life expectancy; e.g., a reduction in accident risk when young or heart-attack risk when older. This assumption is challenged by recent research that finds individuals have systematically different preferences over time paths of mortality-risk reduction; some people prefer near-term risk reductions, others prefer risk reductions at older ages. The goal of this research is to estimate the monetary value of mortality-risk reduction in the American population and to describe how it varies with the total gain in life expectancy and the time path of annual risk reductions. This knowledge should help in refining estimates of the monetary value of the benefits of certain government policies for comparison with their costs, and contribute to decision making in other domains such as health care where evaluation is less formal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a stated-preference survey instrument, administer the survey over the internet to a sample of 1000 or more individuals representative of the adult US population, and analyze the results to determine how the monetary value of mortality-risk reduction depends on the gain in life expectancy and the time path of the risk reductions. The survey will present to each respondent a description and graphic illustrating his or her baseline annual chances of dying in or surviving each of the following decades through age 100 (conditional on age and gender). It will also present perturbations of this baseline hazard function, obtained by reducing mortality risk for only the first decade, and by reducing mortality risk in all future decades by subtracting a constant or multiplying by a constant. The three perturbations will be calibrated to produce the same increase in life expectancy. Respondents will be asked to report their preferences between each pair of the three perturbations (to test for consistency) and separately to report their willingness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most empirical research assumes prices are determined by firms' product portfolios, the extent to which consumers view products as differentiated, and, importantly, competition based solely on current market conditions. However, when firms expect to compete in the future and have sufficiently low discount rates, threats of future price wars can support higher prices than predicted by static pricing models. This project explores this theory in two ways. First, the investigators develop and estimate a repeated game model of oligopoly price leadership. The assumptions in the model are motivated by an industry practice where one firm proposes a markup to a coalition. The model is then used to understand how mergers change pricing incentives. Second, the investigators develop a test of static competition that is robust to how exactly firms set prices under the alternative hypothesis. This research illustrates both methodologies with empirical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research characterizes equilibrium in the price leadership model, state conditions under which marginal costs can be recovered given data on prices, quantities, and demand estimates, and characterize conditions under which firms' implied time preferences can be identified. The investigators apply the model to the U.S. brewing industry and study how the Miller/Coors joint venture changed pricing incentives. The test for static Nash competition takes into account product differentiation and multi-product ownership by individual firms. This test is applied to the U.S. canned tuna market, where two of the three largest firms recently plead guilty to price fixing. This research shows how the framework can be used to i) date cartel operations, ii) distinguish cartel participants from firms that are simply pricing optimally given its competitors are colluding and iii) study the effectiveness of the cartel by comparing observed prices and variable profits to those that arise in Nash-Bertrand equilibrium and under joint profit maximization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior work with a small sample of only men found that it is possible to predict behavioral performance in such tasks based on the thickness of the cortex in a part of the brain that responds preferentially to faces. Importantly, the manner in which face and non-face recognition abilities were predicted by brain structure was different, with individuals with thicker cortex being better at recognizing vehicles than those with thinner cortex, while individuals with thinner cortex performing better in face recognition tasks. In addition, for faces, only the thickness of the deeper, early developing, layers of the cortex predicted performance. This research will test whether these results replicate in a larger sample of men and women. It will investigate how connections between face-selective cortex and other parts of the brain sensitive to  social interactions could help explain how early experience with faces influences the thickness of deep cortical layers. A better understanding of how the structure of the brain relates to visual abilities could extend predictions to a wide range of occupations such as forensics, medical imaging, and homeland security. The work could also transform how we study cortical development in neurological disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. The project will improve participation of underrepresented middle and high school students from Nashville public schools and increase scientific literacy, via the team's contributions to the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to advance our understanding of how the cortical microstructure of visual areas relates to individual differences in visual abilities.

However, sometimes when organizations attempt to make their hiring, evaluation, and promotion processes meritocratic, their employees, consumers, and the public resist these changes. While there are numerous theories that suggest what might underlie such backlash, there is little evidence of what causes it. This project asks what produces backlash to gender diversity initiatives and which factors can reduce backlash. The project will address a fundamental social psychological question: which factors can override the psychological tendency for individuals to defend their group status and the status quo when either appears to be threatened? Findings of this project can help organizational leaders increase buy-in as they attempt to implement changes that will reduce workplace gender inequity and make their firms more meritocratic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study derives hypotheses from diverse sociological and psychological literatures, including group position theory, system justification theory, moral foundations theory, and identity control theory. Hypotheses suggest that messaging that provides data illustrating the extent of the gender inequality or its illegitimacy, minimizes threat to male group position, justifies the intervention using particular moral values (like loyalty and respect) or business motivations, or frames the intervention as influencing rather than adjusting the organizational practices, will be more successful in garnering support for the initiative compared to messaging that does not. Using six original experiments, the project determines whether and among whom support for an organizational gender intervention increases if its announcement: (1) provides data illustrating the extent of the gender inequality; (2) provides evidence that the gender inequality is illegitimate; (3) reduces threat against male group position; (4) justifies the intervention using particular moral values; (5) justifies the intervention using business motivations rather than moral motivations; and (6) frames the intervention as influencing or adjusting the organizational practices. Subjects will be recruited from a nationally representative sample, thus enhancing the external validity of the findings.

This project aims to discover and specify how human learning processes operate differently under different contexts, depending upon what content is being learned. This research contributes to improved educational practices by specifying how learning processes are influenced by knowledge acquisition in a systematic and replicable way.

The goal of this project is to resolve and clarify how these processes compete for cognitive resources, including attention and working memory, in ways that depend on the knowledge content to be learned. This research examines (1) the learning processes involved in learning from retrieval practice and from worked examples, (2) how these learning processes work differently when applied to different knowledge content, and (3) the computational mechanisms of learning that give rise to learning different content. The researchers use a combination of experiments in which the learning approach is varied along with the materials being studied and machine learning models. It will demonstrate knowledge-learning dependence by showing that one learning process (e.g., retrieval practice) produces better learning outcomes than another (e.g., example encoding) in some knowledge contexts but the reverse occurs in other knowledge contexts. By implementing the studies as part of a machine learning architecture, this research will provide computational evidence and theoretical insight into the hypothesized knowledge-learning dependence framework.

Yet, this ideal has failed to gain widespread practical traction, challenged, in part, by the lack of developed methodologies and also because of privacy's conceptual complexity, which hampers its operationalization. This project addresses both challenges simultaneously, seeking (i) to demonstrate how a robust operationalization of privacy can lead to meaningful PbD and (ii) to contribute methodological insight by engaging with ongoing research and development in the area of small data applications, namely, systems that advance wellness and personal productivity by utilizing digital traces from individuals' day-to-day activities, such as e-mail, grocery shopping, TV watching, transportation, mobile devices, and so forth. Adopting the definition of privacy as contextual integrity, the project will focus on selected small-data applications currently ""on the drawing board"" in PI Deborah Estrin's Small Data lab. With these design cases, the project rises to one of the PbD challenges, namely consideration of privacy early on in development and, as a research enterprise, its primary aim is to uncover more and less productive methodological approaches for doing so, resulting in system characteristics well correlated with privacy requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, the project will provide invaluable insight into how to operationalize contextual integrity, which conceives of privacy as appropriate flow of personal information, modeling appropriate flow as conformance with context-specific informational norms, which, prescribe (and prohibit) information flows according to three parameters: actors (subject, sender, recipient), information types, and transmission principles (functional constraints on flow). Adopting contextual integrity as an operational definition means that researchers will assess privacy properties by carefully mapping data flows, and evaluating these flows in terms of the context of application and use. The project also extends past work on formal representations of informational norms by demonstrating how they may be integrated into design practices.  In addition to its substantive contributions this project embodies an innovative collaborative model -- a novel pairing of a computer scientist, Deborah Estrin (Cornell), with a philosopher, Helen Nissenbaum (NYU), in an equal partnership to forge technologies that embody meaningful privacy."

By contrast, RCR training courses typically focus on narrow, rule-based prohibitions, an approach which has been shown to have limited scope and impact.

Strand I involves the creation of a set of guided deliberations that will be used with a cohort of 15 science faculty. These deliberations explore how GVS might better motivate scientists to engage in RCR, to reason ethically, and to integrate GVS into their teaching, research, and mentoring. The guided deliberations will be examined to evaluate their effects on scientists' motivation and reasoning about RCR and their literacy about GVS topics. Relations among these factors will also be examined.

Specifically, the research addresses three critical research questions: (1) How do intra-seasonal dynamics of both the environment and social systems shape farmer adaptive capacity? (2) To what extent does intra-seasonal decision making enable farmers to adapt to climate uncertainty? and (3) How can intra-seasonal data improve the ability to model, predict, and improve adaptation to climate variability in ways that enhance food security?

It is also listed in ""Category IV: Languages which are exceptionally difficult for native English speakers"" by the Foreign Service Institute (U.S. Dept. of State, 2016). A major contributor to this difficulty is the fact that Mandarin is a tonal language, in which differences in pitch contours alone completely change the meaning of a word (e.g., [ma]-flat tone = mother; [ma]-rising tone = hemp; [ma]-low dipping tone = horse; [ma]-falling tone = scold). A successful learner of Mandarin thus needs to be able to distinguish between different tones, connect tonal information with word meaning, and process all this information in real-time while listening and speaking. Little is known so far about which aspects of this complex learning task are particularly challenging for English-speaking learners of Mandarin, and what instructional practices may aid them in mastering this challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to investigate second language (L2) learners' processing and use of tones at multiple levels, including tone perception, real-time lexical processing, and word learning, in order to gain a broader understanding of the challenges in the L2 acquisition of Mandarin tones by native speakers of English. To this end, the project draws on theoretical models and methodological paradigms from research in Speech Perception and Psycholinguistics that has investigated the perception and processing of tones by native speakers, and extends these paradigms to investigate the acquisition and use of tones by L2 learners. The project consists of 3 experiments. Experiment 1 employs identification and discrimination tasks well established in categorical perception research to explore the extent to which L2 learners perceive tone categorically, and the role of L2 experience in this process. Experiment 2 investigates L2 learners' use of tone in the real-time comprehension of spoken Mandarin in a visual-world eye tracking study. Finally, Experiment 3 studies how English speakers with no tonal language experience learn novel words with tones under different training conditions. By exploring the widely recognized difficulty with tones in L2 learning in a controlled laboratory environment, this project will advance our understanding of how L2 learners perceive, process and learn tones in Mandarin, and provide first-hand evidence to inform evidence-based L2 instruction and curricular materials in a language critical to U.S. national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bilingual phenomenon of code-switching, or the use of two languages in a single linguistic unit, embodies this interaction of linguistic systems. This unit can be a conversation, a sentence or even a word. Although code-switching was previously thought to be a 'substandard' use of language, researchers have determined that it is in fact systematic and rule-governed. Thus, the study of code-switching provides a unique lens with which to view the rules that constrain language. A primary question of interest regards the minimal linguistic unit within which code-switching can occur. While it appears that a single word can be composed of morphemes (i.e., the smallest meaning-bearing linguistic unit) from two different languages, researchers have claimed that the sounds used to produce that word must come from a single language. However, these claims have never been tested empirically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project takes a laboratory phonology approach to determining the minimum linguistic unit within which a bilingual can combine elements from their two phonological (i.e., sound) systems. Intraword code-switching by Mexican Spanish/English early bilinguals will be examined using two experimental paradigms: a production study, and an aural acceptability judgment task. The results from these experiments will inform whether bilinguals produce phonologically switched words and accept phonologically switched words as licit outputs of their linguistic systems, thus confirming or rejecting the hypothesis that the word is the minimal unit for phonological code-switching. In addition to its theoretical contributions, dissemination of this research in the local Chicago community will contribute to the goal of informing the general public and bilingual educators/administrators about the use of code-switching as a standard bilingual speech practice that is rule governed like any natural language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, progress depends upon innovative policy solutions to society's problems. The transmission of laws and regulations across political boundaries averts a conflict between the incentives for innovation and consistency.  The current project will offer a database that allows the tracking of the spread of policies through the US states. The database will be disseminated through project webpages. The web interface will also include advanced analytics that illuminate the pathways through which policies spread. Users will be able to download the data and software for their own custom analysis of policy transmission in the US states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Policy diffusion has been a topic of focus across the social sciences for several decades, but due to limitations of data and computational technology, researchers have not taken a comprehensive look at patterns of diffusion across many different policies. The investigators propose to combine cutting-edge methods of text and network analysis to understand how policies, as represented in digitized text, spread through networks connecting the American states. The investigators will develop both data and computational methods that address the most pressing limitations to the study of policy diffusion networks. The project will result in two key contributions: (1) a comprehensive source of data with which to track the movement of policies from one state government to another, across three governing branches, and (2) a user-friendly, open source software package for understanding and visualizing diffusion networks from digitized records of policies. These resources will help researchers, public officials, advocacy groups, and other relevant stakeholders understand how to balance the competing goals of innovation and consistency in public policy."

Ventures like this are outliers because they are rare and have disproportionate impact at multiple levels. Moreover, these outlier ventures are very different in both their inputs and outcomes than what most would characterize as typical. The project's framework will enhance knowledge of how organizational systems grow, improve performance, and achieve outlier outcomes over time in changing competitive environments. Because this framework is built on data from multiple complex social systems, it is generalizable for and capable of improving the outcomes of individuals, teams, firms, industries, and nations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching research focus of this project is to identify the primary drivers of outlier outcomes in entrepreneurship. Building a theory about the emergence of outliers is difficult under the assumption of normal, bell-shaped distributions of inputs and outcomes. Under the normal distribution assumption, outliers are usually cleansed from the analysis-either deleted or mathematically transformed-to reduce their influence. This project moves beyond the normal distribution assumption and uses theoretical assumptions and methods from complexity science. This theoretical approach has two advantages. First, a complexity perspective assumes that in relatively unconstrained environments, outcomes will likely be distributed according to a power law. This distribution is vital because traditional theory building and testing methods assume that the probability of an extreme event is effectively zero. A power law assumption can more adequately reflect the empirical distributions found in studies of emerging ventures. Second, a complexity perspective suggests that a system's outcomes are primarily the result of an interconnected combinations of inputs, including 1) an agent's initial endowment of resources, 2) the agent's rules for engagement with other agents based on expectations for future outcomes, and 3) the quantity and quality of environmental resources. Within this perspective, the emergence of a system from non-existence to existence occurs as a nonlinear, threshold-based process. This project uses non-parametric maximum-likelihood bootstrap estimates of power law fit on representative samples of nascent entrepreneurial ventures to derive a meta-construct framework of inputs that apply to all organizational forms: endowments, expectations, engagement, and environments. Then, to test this generalizable 4E framework, these inputs are used to build an agent-based simulation model, the outcomes for which will be validated with empirical data from the fastest growing privately held firms."

Successful resource management is essential for societies to prosper, particularly during turbulent times. With a long-term perspective, archaeology is well-suited to assess resource management strategies because what is successful in the short-term may not be successful over hundreds or thousands of years. Turbulent times do not affect all people equally, and this project will address how degrees of access to resources change as political and ecological environments change. Throughout the course of this research project, both Belizean citizens and Northwestern University undergraduates will be trained in archaeological methods. The results of this research will be shared through community events, public talks, academic articles, and an online platform so that a range of individuals including scientists, government officials, and the general public will have access to its findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grauer and her research team will investigate how degrees of commoner access to resources changed in a city that thrived through times of water scarcity and political instability. The research will take place at Aventura, a medium-sized ancient Maya city in northernmost Belize. The city flourished from 750-1100 CE, a time when many large Maya cities were abandoned due to a combination of drought and political upheaval. Important resources within the city of Aventura were pocket bajos, small non-draining depressions in the land that were either used for water management or agriculture in the past. This research will determine how pocket bajos were used and who had access to the resources they provided. The project will assess how commoner access to pocket bajo resources changed as drought and political instability increased regionally. The research team will conduct systematic excavations of a commoner household and take soil cores from a pocket bajos in Aventura.

In living societies, increasing settlement and population density can be accompanied by greater exposure and susceptibility to dangerous infectious diseases, social inequality, unsanitary living conditions, and unstable food supplies.  Paleodemography; the study of human populations in the archaeological past based on skeletal remains - can provide important insights into the complex relationships between people, their social and physical environments, and their diseases even in the absence of written historical records.  This project will investigate the effects of urbanization on human health and the risk of death in medieval Denmark (c. AD 1050-1536) to disentangle the social and biological influences on human health in changing populations.  In paleodemography, ""frailty"" is defined as an individual's age-adjusted risk of death.  Frailty can vary owing to individual differences in susceptibility to disease and death that may have underlying genetic, social, or environmental causes.  New statistical analyses of skeletal samples from medieval Denmark will be used to determine how patterns of variation in frailty and risk of death in the past differed as a result of increased urbanization during the medieval period.  This project will inform us about the role of urbanization in past preindustrial populations that dealt with the same illnesses and conditions that continue to influence people today, and as such will provide insight into how to avoid emerging health risks.  Broader impacts of this study include museum exhibitions, public science outreach efforts (particularly aimed at promoting the role of women in scientific research), and continued international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project brings together established paleodemographic approaches and a new model of frailty, along with newly-developed statistical methods, to investigate the relationship between childhood and adult frailty and the risk of death from skeletal data in order to determine the effects of urbanization on age-at-death distributions from medieval Denmark.  Skeletal remains from the Ole Wormsgade urban cemetery, Sejet rural parish cemetery, and the monastic cemetery of Om Kloster, which represent samples of the people who occupied the area in and near the medieval port city of Horsens on the eastern coast of Jutland, Denmark, will be examined.  These samples will be analyzed to determine: (1) how frailty and age-at-death patterns differed as a result of urbanization over the medieval period, (2) how males and females were affected differently by their social and physical environments within and across the three samples, and (3) what the relationship was between childhood frailty and resulting adult frailty and mortality.  These goals will be met by estimating disease prevalence and the associated risk of death in relation to boney indicators of childhood stress, infection, and malnutrition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even though migrant remittances serve as an important source of financial flows to the developing world, hence a major source of economic growth and global development, the cost of remittances tend to be very high averaging about 8% of the amount transmitted.   It is hypothesized that on-line comparison shopping will allow consumers to choose companies that provide lower cost with better services and as a result, prices for these services are likely to fall.  While this is a possibility, there is limited empirical evidence of this issue mainly because of lack of data.  The proposed research will combine economic theory, structural modelling, field experiments, and survey data to investigate these issues.  The PIs will survey 400 migrants from different countries who use these on-line comparison shopping websites to determine what impacts on-line comparison shopping have on choice of company and the impact of these comparisons on the cost of sending money.  The results of this research will have important impacts on the cost of sending migrant remittances, possibly increase the volume and the number of market participants, as well as significantly contribute to global development.  The results will also establish the US as the global leader in migrants' transfer markets.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research project will use a variety of methods to study the causal impacts of on-line comparison shopping for migrant remittance services on the choice of companies by migrants and the cost of such services.

The PIs seek to extend research on the impacts of information and communication technologies on consumer behavior to an unexplored market---the remittance industry.

As technology will continue to have an impact on the labor market as the nature of work evolves and trade patterns change, it is important to understand how the existing workforce will adapt to these changes through investment in acquiring skills. The primary goal of this research is to advance our understanding of these effects in order to help guide relevant policy decisions. The project will examine how rapid developments in technology and trade patterns can affect the importance of different skills in the labor market, and how workers adapt to these changes, for instance by learning new skills or changing jobs. In particular, the project will examine how trade and technology shocks and the response in the labor market affect the distribution of income, with focus on differences between workers of different ages, educational levels and occupations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a framework of skill investment and job choice when both skills and jobs are heterogeneous but are not hierarchically ordered. This project focuses on two kinds of models. The first model treats the wage structure as exogenous to the worker's decisions. Workers repeatedly choose jobs, and how much to invest in which skills given how they are rewarded. Using this model, the research examines both theoretically and empirically how worker decisions respond to unanticipated technology and trade shocks. The second one is a general equilibrium model of skill investment in this setting. The research based on this model investigates the properties of the equilibrium when workers are ex ante homogeneous and studies what happens when, after they have made their skill investment decisions, these workers face a shock. This research examines ripple effects that alter outcomes even for workers not directly affected. The research also weighs the direct losses to a worker adversely affected by a shock that favored some workers and hurt others against the possible indirect benefit from a decline in the price of output. Finally, the project will extend the model to allow workers to be heterogeneous in their level of education.  This research will be useful in exploring the links between education and skill investment, which is a crucial link in explaining the relation between education and jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some contend that a driving force behind these developments is increased financialization of the economy. This argument holds that pressures stemming from shareholders, financial institutions, and financialized management strategies have altered the way firms and managers structure jobs, potentially diminishing firm investments in human capital and eroding job quality in favor of increased profits. Thus, short-term financial considerations have displaced more far-sighted management approaches that are beneficial to both workers and firms. Despite the frequency of these assertions, supporting data are scarce. This project evaluates these arguments by conducting a nationally representative survey of business establishments across three industries. The data will be used to test whether variation in job structure and quality are related to variation in measures of financialization. The project speaks to societal  concerns regarding economic inequality and changes in the distribution of high- and low-wage jobs in the U.S. economy. This information will be of interest to policymakers concerned with job and economic growth both nationally and at the state and local levels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;           This project will construct a nationally representative survey of establishments in three industries that are part of matched firms that have been subjected to greater and lesser levels of financialization, with a targeted sample size of 1,200-1,600 establishments. These industries include: 1) professional, scientific, and technical services; 2) computer and electronic manufacturing; and 3) retail. This choice of industries allows for focused attention on how financialization pressures affect science and technology workers and how these pressures differ from those found in other industries. The survey will ask detailed questions about job quality and structure, including questions about wages, contingent labor, skill demands, job tenure, training, and promotion policies. The target respondents are human resource managers who are employed at the randomly-selected business establishments. The establishment survey will be linked with lagged firm-level indicators of financialization, corporate governance, and shareholder ownership drawn from several business databases used in prior research.

Accurate disambiguation relies on a shared background of knowledge and abilities, which may prove inadequate as concepts spread into new contexts or a community grows larger and more heterogeneous.

It will provide novel tools for tracking changes in language at the level of populations rather than individuals while remaining sensitive to underlying social institutions and individual differences.

There is evidence that the number of symbols in the written form of a sound can influence how long that sound is produced, even when a written form is not explicitly present. For example, the final /k/ sounds in the English words ""tic"", ""click"", and ""clique"" are represented by 1, 2, and 3 letters, respectively. When people produce these words, the final /k/ of ""click"" is produced longer than than the final /k/ of ""tic"". And the final /k/ of ""clique"" is produced longer still. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that as the complexity of a written form increases, so too does the speech duration of the associated sound, all else being equal. This phenomenon is inconsistent with some models of language production which argue that written information should not influence speech, especially when written information is not explicitly present. Additionally, it remains unclear exactly which types of written information can influence speech duration as there is disagreement about the mechanisms that drive this effect. Some argue the relationship between sounds and written symbols underlie this effect. Others argue the amount of visual information itself regardless of any connection to sounds is driving these duration differences. This study examines the relationship between sounds, symbols, and speech duration to develop our understanding of what types of written information can alter speech patterns. Addressing this question will inform theoretical models of human speech production. Additionally, data collected through this research can be incorporated into computational speech synthesis and speech recognition systems for more accurate, robust, and natural models of human speech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A challenge of previous research in this area was that it relied upon natural speech data which includes many external factors across individuals that can influence speech duration outside of written forms (e.g. word frequency). To gain greater control of these variables, the current study will employ a three-day novel-word-learning experiment in which participants learn sets of novel non-word homophones along with one of several novel writing systems. Novel homophones in a set are learned as the same word phonologically but are written distinctly. Written complexity for homophones may vary by: a) number of whole characters; b) number of pen strokes; c) number of components with phonological associations; d) number of components without phonological associations. Participants will produce learned words in a picture-naming task without written forms explicitly present. Participants' production will be recorded and speech duration will be measured. Duration among homophones in a set and across writing systems will be compared to determine: a) if increased written complexity influences duration even when written forms are not explicitly present; b) which types of written information may influence duration and whether written complexity must have a phonological association to influence speech; and c) at which point in the training process speech patterns change and whether these patterns persist through the end of the experimental period. This data will comprise a portion of the doctoral dissertation. An earlier portion of the dissertation investigated similar durational phenomenon in Japanese speakers in regards to written character complexity. To remain consistent with previous data set, retain the ability to compare results from the current study with earlier data in the dissertation, and provide the opportunity to replicate previous findings in the current study, participants for the current study will be native Japanese speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also create an environment in which neighboring countries, such as the United States, can grow and prosper. One of the driving forces behind economic stability and performance is thought to be good governance, particularly significant fiscal decentralization. But cross-country analyses of the effects of decentralization on economic development and corruption reduction have produced contradictory findings. The result is that both theoretical and practical understanding of what promotes good governance and, thereby, economic stability and development, has lagged. The research supported by this award addresses this policy challenge through an in-depth, locally comparative, ethnographic investigation of the effects of a case of recent fiscal decentralization. The research is important because if the links between decentralization and good governance can be identified through an intensive study of a single case, findings can then be generalized to improve theoretical understanding and policy globally.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by anthropologist Dr. Jean Ensminger (California Institute of Technology). The researcher has identified Kenya as an excellent site for this study because the country has recently implemented a strong version of decentralization. The new governmental structure divides the nation into 47 counties each with a governor who controls significant fiscal resources. Theory that links decentralization to better economic performance in democratic countries rests on two unproven assumptions: that citizens will have improved access to information so that they can monitor the performance of their leaders, and that citizens value performance above other factors such as ethnic favoritism and patronage. This research tests these assumptions and theoretical predictions. Because of the inconsistent findings of quantitative studies of this problem, the researcher will take a largely qualitative and inductive approach. The researcher will collect data with a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, including: interviews with governors, particularly those identified by civil society leaders as reformist; interviews with constituents and county-level government officials; analyses of longitudinal county-level records, voting records, and publicly available polling data; and analyses of reports of anti-corruption and audit bodies. Findings from the research should help policy makers understand whether a strong model of fiscal decentralization can offer a path forward for more effective policy.

Research has documented child victimization but has not explored holistically and systematically how children understand the nature, causes, and interactions of different forms of violence, and the specific actions that children take to cope with violence in their lives. Working from the premise that children are active agents living their lives as well as victims of circumstance, the research supported by this award will investigate these topics. The research is important: in the United States, violence has been described as a public health crisis for children. Understanding how exposure to different forms of violence shapes children's worldviews and coping strategies is critical for developing programs and policies that support children's resilience and counter its long-term effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by psychological and cognitive anthropologist, Dr. Norbert Ross of Vanderbilt University, who is well-known for his cross-cultural research on cognitive development in children. The researcher has chosen El Salvador as the research site for two overarching reasons. First, violence of all kinds is rampant in El Salvador, in the present and in memories of the past, and often is the impetus for young people migrating to the United States. Better understanding of these roots of migration can help to develop more effective policies to control it. Second, the prevalence of violence in a comparatively small country makes it more feasible (than it would be in the U.S.) to conduct a scientific study of children's negotiations of and uptakes of pervasively violent environments. The researcher will collect data through a suite of methods including observations of children's interactions in a variety of natural settings at school, home, and play; brief interviews with children using established, child-specific and child-sensitive protocols; family interviews and focus groups; and memory mappings of geo-referenced, violence-specific landscapes. In addition, because of the challenges of working with younger children ethically and productively, the project introduces novel research methods that will provide new ways of conducting ethnographic research with children in violent environments and the research team incorporates local child psychologists as consultants. Findings from the research will be shared with the general public, practitioners who work with children, policy makers, and other social scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While environmental scientists have documented the sources of air pollution and social scientists have demonstrated how the effects of air pollution are unevenly distributed, scholars still know markedly little about the socio-ecological drivers and consequences of seasonal air pollution and by what mechanisms such pollution comes to be constituted as a crisis or triggers a political response. An adequate explanatory framework accounting for these social dimensions of seasonal air pollution - particularly when its causes are recurring yet uncertain - is needed to improve environmental governance practices, and avert social conflict. Findings will be disseminated to organizations and individuals that influence policy debates related to air pollution. The project also provides training for graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis; broadens participation in the sciences through the training of students and a postdoctoral researcher from underrepresented groups; and it improves scientific infrastructure through international scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Mary Mostafanezhad of the University of Hawaii at Manoa will examine the socio-ecological drivers of air pollution, and the ways that air pollution, or haze, becomes constituted as a crisis in national and international circles. The research will take place in northern Thailand provides, which is an illustrative case since airborne particulate matter levels have themselves remained relatively constant over the past two decades; it is only the framing of air pollution as a crisis that has changed. In Asia, a thick shroud of pollution, dubbed the ""brown cloud of Asia"", blankets many countries for half of the year. And its impacts reach far beyond the region, since particulate matter can travel long distances: research has shown that Asian pollution has even affected the west coast of the United States. The once quotidian, annual occurrence of what is commonly called the ""smoky season"" (February-April) in this region, now registers as a crisis for many (but not all) residents, some of whom demand an urgent political response. Additionally, while uncertainty exists surrounding the socio-ecological drivers of air pollution, multiple narratives of its causes and effects circulate throughout the region, and blame is frequently placed on smallholder farmers who have recently entered into new market relations. These circumstances make the region an ideal site to examine the ways in which crises are contingent on cultural and political factors, rather than fixed metric thresholds. This project will collect discursive, ethnographic and geospatial data to understand its specific socio-ecological drivers (e.g. social inequality, fire use, worldviews) and consequences (e.g. crisis and blame narratives, regulatory regimes). The mixed methods approach of this study will contribute both to policy understandings of environmental change and to political ecology debates over the ways such change becomes a crisis and a political field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research on the role of response time will benefit the practice of test/survey development and administration. The measurement model to be developed will rely on very few parametric assumptions, which will make it appropriate for analyzing a wide variety of computerized assessment/online survey data.

To achieve maximal generalizability, the distributions of item responses and response times conditional on the latent traits will be characterized by smooth probability mass/density functions and approximated by tensor-product regression splines with a functional analysis of variance parameterization. The investigators will develop and implement a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm for the penalized maximum likelihood estimation of the proposed semi-parametric model. To avoid overfitting, they will examine the empirical selection of smoothing parameters by effective degrees of freedom and a mixed-effects model representation.

Using archival research methods, the researcher will examine how the war years were transformative in institutionalizing public-funded agricultural research that expanded the systematic study of local vernacular knowledge systems. The shift from small individual research institutions to large-scale public initiatives during the war was central to the emergence of Big Science for agriculture, which served to alleviate the impoverished wartime economy. The shift was accomplished by bringing scientists in closer contact with local farmers as scientists benefited through the study and codification of vernacular knowledge while farmers were given greater access to scientific education and improved crop varieties.  The findings of this research have potential policy implications for international development initiatives and Chinese agricultural development more specifically. With the current renewed interest in pre-1949 models of rural development by the ""New Rural Reconstruction Movement"" in China, the co-PI plans to write short articles to bring his findings to a wider audience, especially those associated with rural reform today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to bridge the gap between histories of science focused on transnational and national transformations (such as the emergence of Big Science during World War II) and micro-histories of vernacular knowledge systems. Rather than focusing solely on one of these aspects of wartime science, this research shows how the local interacted with the national and transnational: not only were non-elite actors and local knowledge systems vital to the construction of scientific knowledge and increasing agricultural production for the war, but the geopolitics of science and the hierarchies often built into research and development schemes shaped how Chinese scientists approached the process of knowledge accumulation. These transformations are vital to understanding post-war rural development and the foundations of China's subsequent Green Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

College is often thought to be the great equalizer because it promotes upward mobility.  But the expansion of higher education may not ensure equal opportunity for everyone, especially when a growing number of people are acquiring an advanced degree. This project will study why the influence of family background becomes stronger among advanced degree holders while it is still weak among those with a BA/BS degree only. This study evaluates three explanations by studying the income levels of those with at least a BA/BS degree.  These people may:  1) attain a highly-lucrative advanced degree such as an MBA or professional degree (vertical selection); 2) major in a non-vocational field of study at the undergraduate level and a profitable one at the graduate level, including health, law, and business (horizontal selection); or 3) complete education at an earlier age and have more years of work experience (cumulative advantage). The project will provide implications for families and educators concerned with the relative tradeoffs for investment in various types of higher education.  The project will also provide implications for states and U.S. society generally in creating policies aimed at promoting useful educational investment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze income returns to education for adults who achieve various levels of higher education.

The Annual Meeting of OHBM is regarded as the premier venue for the integration of innovative brain imaging methods and cognitive neuroscience. It was started more than 20 years ago to provide a forum for the brain-mapping scientific community to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-three highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2018 Annual Meeting to be held in Singapore. Travel awards will be given to 30 students with high-ranking abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research.

These openly available videos and slides include keynote lectures and educational courses on topics covering state-of-the-art methodologies and clinical applications of neuroimaging. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low. In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively high. Hence, the conference's position in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience.

Solitary confinement is an important but understudied part of the experience of punishment in the United States. The scant available evidence suggests solitary confinement is associated with poor health and adjustment to society after incarceration. The current project, the Pennsylvania Solitary Confinement Study (PASS), will analyze conditions of penal confinement and their effects on health and well-being, labor force participation after prison release, and recidivism. The project will provide a multidimensional account of the conditions and effects of extreme confinement in a large U.S. prison system. The project will also improve our understanding of how solitary confinement is used, and how it may have significant and long-lasting effects. A key broader impact of the project is to enable a research-driven national policy effort to reevaluate the use and policies of solitary confinement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Quantitative studies of the effects of solitary confinement have relied on observational data to estimate weakly-identified causal effects. The current project will use detailed statewide prison records (2007-2017) to estimate causal effects of solitary confinement on long-term outcomes, exploiting the random assignment of hearing examiners to prison misconduct cases. It combines field surveys of incarcerated men and prison staff in a solitary confinement unit with a quantitative state-wide analysis of administrative prison records.  The longitudinal survey data collection combines an analysis of prison records, a survey and neurocognitive battery administered to incarcerated men (N=117, including a main sample of 99 and a pretest sample of 18) recently admitted to solitary confinement and then three months later, and interviews with prison staff (N=22). Analysis of this quasi-experiment will yield estimates of the effect of solitary confinement on employment and recidivism. Because prior research on solitary confinement has been based on clinical interviews with small samples often in the context of litigation, the survey extends research by collecting data at scale with a standardized instrument. Survey responses at two points in time allows a comparison of the conditions of solitary confinement with the general prison population. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts will illuminate the relationship between prisoners and staff and shed light on the mechanisms by which solitary confinement produces long-term impacts. The proposed study will contribute new data and analysis for policymakers and scholars seeking to understand and address the conditions of penal confinement in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Joseph T. McGuire at Boston University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the neural mechanisms of human decision-making. To make advantageous decisions in a changing world, we must learn from new observations. How quickly we learn should depend on the context: in stable but noisy environments, new observations should be given limited weight, whereas volatile environments require faster updating. The proposed work uses eye tracking and brain imaging to investigate how decision-makers incorporate new information into their existing knowledge. These methods allow us to capture the richness of an individual's subjective predictions, and investigate the effects of uncertainty and reward on sensory and cognitive representations. This work to understand human decision-making is critical to a healthy and equitable society, and is especially important when it comes to behavior that deviates from expectations. When thinking about the domains of economics and health, for instance, there are myriad examples of decisions that seem irrational. These decisions defy our sense of logic, but they are incredibly common. The proposed work seeks to further our understanding of how people take in new information and integrate it with existing knowledge to make decisions in a dynamic world. A full description of how people do this will allow us to craft better policy, promote health and prosperity, and support our national defense, taking into account the realities of human irrationality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first aim of the project is to explore the temporal dimension of belief updating and the influence of reward in a free-viewing implicit spatial prediction task. Eye tracking will allow us to monitor the trial-by-trial evolution of individuals' predictive distributions, and investigate the effects of reward and punishment on learning rate and saccade dynamics. In contrast to prior work, we now have access to information about the construction and updating of underlying predictive distributions, instead of single point estimates from the distribution on each trial. The second aim of the project is to use pupillometry and neuroimaging to probe the mechanisms of belief updating in a fixational spatial prediction task. Pupillometry will allow us to assess whether reward and punishment enhance learning rate through common arousal/incentive mechanisms, as this is an unresolved question in the field. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will allow us to probe changes in sensory representations in response to different types of uncertainty (environmental noise and volatility) separately, as well as how these factors change the functional connectivity between frontal brain regions and visual cortices. This work will serve to unite research on the impact of uncertainty on sensory and cognitive processing. Ultimately, this project will help us understand how subjective belief distributions are created and updated, and how the brain dynamically adapts this process in a changing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, people are increasingly aware of discrimination and inequality faced by different social groups.  Examples include the gender pay gap, race-based housing discrimination, and prejudice based on gender identity.  Much is known about when people within a disadvantaged group identify with and support other members of the same group.  Less is known about how people from one disadvantaged group view members of other disadvantaged groups who face a different type of inequality.  People who belong to one disadvantaged social group may think that their experiences with discrimination and inequality are similar to those of other disadvantaged groups.  As a result, they may identify with members of the other group and seek to support them.  However, it is also possible that people who belong to one disadvantaged group see their experiences as very different than those of other disadvantaged groups, and therefore take less interest in supporting them.  This project explores how and why these different perspectives develop.  This research focuses on the ways in which people think about their own inequality and how that may influence their support for members of other groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of experiments and field studies focus on the beliefs that people have about the causes of their own group's inequality.  One pattern of beliefs may attribute such inequality to the prejudices and negative attitudes of other individuals.  A different pattern of beliefs may attribute inequality to the ways that society and its institutions are structured.  This work tests if beliefs that one's own group faces inequality because of institutional discrimination will lead people to support action to reduce inequality faced by another group. Several experiments also examine alternative explanations for why institutional understandings of discrimination may lead to more support for addressing inequality faced by different groups.  One area of application considers whether such beliefs influence people's opinions about discrimination cases brought by a person from another disadvantaged social group. These research questions and applications are addressed among individuals from several different disadvantaged groups, examining attitudes and behavior towards multiple social groups. The results of this project will advance our understanding of when individuals from different disadvantaged social groups will work together to reduce different types of inequalities. The long-term goal is to understand how experiences with discrimination and inequality may influence how people from different social groups relate to one another.  Gaining this deeper scientific understanding will provide insight into how to reduce conflict and support healthier interpersonal relationships in an increasingly diverse nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cutting-edge research in the natural and social sciences utilizes digital technology to model and evaluate important social, environmental and scientific problems. Sophisticated modeling techniques and expanding datasets require the processing capabilities of a multi-processor server with the capability to read and analyze datasets sized as large as several hundred gigabytes or low terabytes. High-performance computing systems offer computing power that is useable across any discipline with computer modeling or data analysis applications. The research to be supported by this equipment is varied and impactful, ranging from studies of the impact of trade and agricultural technology on food markets to genomic studies of variation in pain sensitivity. This proposal includes nine separate research projects slated to use the HPC system with many more in queue. Overall, this substantial increase in processing capability enhances the scope of existing research at Middlebury and makes possible new projects that would have otherwise been impossible with existing computing infrastructure. HPC also supports faculty-mentored research-training programs in the social and natural sciences, fulfilling a critical part of the college's teaching mission. Middlebury College takes special effort to recruit and support underrepresented minorities in the STEM and STEM-related social sciences. HPC increases student access to faculty-guided research in these fields. The research to be conducted focuses primarily on human behaviors with the potential to refine best practices in neurological and genomic studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research projects will leverage the HPC resource across political science, economics, neuroscience, computer science and biology. One project examines heterogeneous causes for unemployment and their impact on labor market recovery rates, suggesting more targeted corrective measures for unemployment. A neuroscience study explores pain perception and stress responses, focusing on how animals learn in response to noxious stimuli and tying particular genes to variation in responses. Two other projects involve DNA sequencing. One offers new modeling techniques to improve genotype prediction from observed data; another examines toxic algae blooms and investigates viruses as bloom-mitigation mechanisms using genome sequencing techniques.

Under the sponsorship of Dr. Adam Gazzaley at the University of California, San Francisco, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist examining the neural mechanisms that predict cognitive and brain plasticity in older adults. Cognitive control comprises a set of neural processes that are critical for goal-directed behavior. Non-pathological declines in cognitive control functions are common in healthy older populations, such as pronounced distractibility during working memory performance. There have also been numerous efforts to develop non-invasive methods to enhance cognition in aging, such as cognitive training interventions. However, there is typically heterogeneity in the magnitude of cognitive and neural plasticity across older adults, both in terms of cognitive abilities and training outcomes. The proposed research seeks to identify neural predictors of these individual differences in plasticity in healthy older adults. This work provides important advances in our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cognitive declines in aging and, importantly, offers methods to ameliorate declines in an optimal, personalized manner. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research uses fMRI, functional connectivity, and cognitive training to identify neural predictors of individual differences in plasticity in older adults. The project builds on previous lines of work by examining the predictive relationship between brain network properties and (1) short-term plasticity as assessed during cognitive control tasks that tap aspects of selective attention and working memory and (2) long-term plasticity as assessed by training-related cognitive gains. The central hypothesis of this project is that cognitive and neural plasticity in older adults can be predicted by aspects of brain network organization, in particular brain network modularity, a metric that quantifies the degree to which brain regions belonging to the same sub-network are more connected to each other than the rest of the network. The expected outcomes of this research plan are significant because they contribute to our understanding of the neuroscience of cognitive plasticity and, importantly, how these functions can be improved in older adults. More broadly, the outcomes of this proposal further our mechanistic understanding of how properties of large-scale brain networks support complex behaviors. It is anticipated that the outcomes of this proposal serve as a foundation to develop targeted, personalized interventions to enhance cognitive control in older populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They play an important role in much economic theory and other areas of scientific research. Methods of trend determination have been intensively studied in economics for a long time, yet economists have little guidance on the source and nature of trend behavior and therefore rely on a limited class of models to use in applications. This research program will explore a new approach to studying trends that involves modern machine learning methods. The goal is to model trends when there is little practical or theoretical guidance about the nature of the trending behavior. Methods will be developed to learn about trends in a general function space environment that will enable wide application to study socio-economic phenomena. These methods will be useful in other scientific fields, such as climate change, where trends figure prominently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and analyze an easy-to-implement machine learning procedure that enhances the properties of existing methods of smoothing and filtering data. The central idea is to iterate such filters in a controlled manner to make them a smarter smoothing device for trend determination. This approach involves methods of machine learning based on boosting and the project will develop the necessary theory to justify their application to non-stationary data that manifest trend behavior. In particular, the project will develop a large sample limit theory for boosted filters that will reveal its enhanced capabilities, focusing on the complex task of analyzing properties of the boosting methodology in the context of non-stationary data characterized by deterministic and stochastic trends allowing also for possible structural breaks. The resulting theory will be applicable to a wide class of underlying processes, thereby facilitating informed use of such machine learning devices in practical work in economics and other disciplines where trend determination is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Findings also will increase public and policymakers' knowledge concerning the nature and effects of platform capitalism, thereby informing decision-making and contributing to the national welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on the world's largest platform economy in terms of revenues and number of participants. Using ethnographic observations and interviews with management, workers, and government officials, this research compares work and management relations among three platform corporations in three sectors: transportation, with majority male drivers; domestic labor, with majority female domestic workers; and e-commerce, with majority young shopkeepers respectively.  Comparison across the three cases will help differentiate and theorize the variety of work regimes and labor politics mediated by gender, generation, and the uneven economic and political interest of the state. Empirical data on this platform economy will be useful for sociological analysis, and will provide comparative perspectives for the public, policy makers, unions and businesses in other expanding platform economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Charlotte,E,Till,charlottetill@hotmail.com,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,02/15/2019,04/30/2020,22290.00,"Short-term environmental disturbances and long-term environmental change have displaced millions worldwide. The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also important for occupational success; majorities of both white- and blue-collar workers report using rational numbers in their jobs. Yet, many children struggle with rational numbers even after years of instruction. The goal of this project is to create a theory of children's learning in one area of rational numbers: decimal arithmetic. The project will identify types of knowledge that help children to learn decimal arithmetic more easily, clarify the mechanisms by which this facilitation occurs, and develop a computational model that simulates the process of learning decimal arithmetic. Based on the results, recommendations will be generated for improving children's learning of decimal arithmetic including recommendations (1) to focus classroom and practice time on conceptual approaches that are used by successful learners, (2) to place special emphasis on types of problem that pose difficulty for children, (3) to devote classroom time to illustrating common errors and explaining why they are incorrect, and (4) to use discussion of common errors as an opportunity to illustrate general concepts. These recommendations are anticipated to have implications for improving mathematics instruction in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Learning mathematics involves learning both concepts and procedures. Concepts include principles and relations; procedures are step-by-step action sequences for solving problems. Understanding of concepts is believed to help children learn procedures, but how this occurs is not known. This project aims to create a theory of how conceptual understanding - when present - facilitates learning of procedures within a particularly difficult and important area of math: decimal arithmetic. To accomplish this goal, the project will adopt a three-pronged approach including longitudinal, microgenetic, and computational modeling methods. Longitudinal methods will identify specific types of conceptual knowledge that predict success in learning decimal arithmetic procedures; microgenetic methods will provide evidence for specific mechanisms by which these types of conceptual knowledge facilitate learning; computational modeling will be used to describe these mechanisms precisely and to simulate the empirical phenomena observed using the previous two methods. The computational model will build on and extend a modeling architecture previously employed in a model of fraction arithmetic learning, FARRA; its success will be assessed based on its ability to generate levels of accuracy, patterns of errors, and correlations between conceptual and procedural knowledge similar to those observed among children. The proposed research will advance scientific knowledge in three ways: by connecting individual differences in learning outcomes with a theory of learning processes, by advancing understanding of the relations between conceptual and procedural knowledge, and by extending theories of numerical development into a new domain, decimal arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Jessey,,Wright,jesseywright@gmail.com,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,05/01/2019,04/30/2020,27147.00,"This award supports an interdisciplinary workshop that critically evaluates the use of neuroimaging technology as a window into the representational content of neural activity. The workshop will provide a context for critically examining the empirical significance of appeals to representations. It will bring together philosophers and neuroscientists with overlapping interests in conceptual and empirical challenges related to the search for representations in the brain. The primary goal of the workshop is to identify empirical criteria for individuating representational states and specifying their content within the domains of memory, perception, and action. The workshop will result in a collection of journal articles published in an open access venue that will demonstrate the value of focused interdisciplinary collaborations between philosophers and neuroscientists. The curated program and organizational plan will also be widely shared after the workshop, along with reflections on its effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary workshop brings together philosophers and neuroscientists to focus on the notion of representation and its relationships to neural processes. Neuroscientists investigating human cognition with neuroimaging technology often describe their findings in terms of representations. This concept is ubiquitous, but its meaning and significance varies. Sometimes representations are treated as genuine phenomena that are the targets of investigation and intervention, and at other times the concept is used as a theoretically insignificant stand-in for claims about information carried by or transformed in neural processes. If the concept of representation carries any empirical significance, fully exploiting that significance requires an account of what kind of evidence is required to justify claims about the content and role such a state plays in realizing cognitive capacities. In light of this, workshop participants will focus on three central questions: What is the significance of identifying a pattern of brain activity as a representation? What evidence is required to make such an attribution? Can neuroimaging technologies provide that evidence? Approaching these questions from a purely empirical perspective may end up reinforcing the ambiguities already present in the cognitive neuroscience literature and doing so from a purely philosophical perspective risks generating accounts of representation that are not amenable to empirical investigation. An integrative, interdisciplinary approach seems to be the best path forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, people often abandon their own personal judgments and choices in favor of conforming to a group majority. In some cases, such alignment with the group may protect against social rejection and grant access to shared resources. However, research has shown that people also conform even when there is no social or economic gain for them. One explanation for this result is that the act of reaching consensus with one's group might be valuable in itself -- an idea that is supported by recent neuroscientific research showing that the brain's reward circuit is involved in social conformity. This project combines computational cognitive modeling with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral economic procedures to better understand the subjective value of conforming and dissenting decisions. By uncovering the motivating and reinforcing properties of majority alignment, this research will shed light on a fundamental aspect of organizational, professional and personal interactions. Among the broader impacts is a priority to share data and code to benefit research in cognitive and social neuroscience, to involve the participation of women, underrepresented groups and high school students, and to inform the development of tools that can improve the social competency of impaired individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses model-based cognitive neuroscience to investigate the motivating and reinforcing properties of social conformity. The main approach is to make the desire to conform compete with the prospect of economic gain, and to assess the transfer of conformity-based valence to other features of the environment. A second objective is to investigate how the relative size and perceived competence of a majority opinion influences the value associated with consensus and dissent. A third objective is to explore a common neural representation for conformity and conventional reward.  All of the studies use variations of standard tasks employed in research on economic decision-making. Reinforcement learning models are used to make quantitative predictions about behavioral choices and neural activity.  Model-based fMRI analyses are combined with connectivity and multi-voxel pattern analyses to investigate interactions between social and motivational neural networks, and to explore a distributed overlapping neural code for social and economic currencies.  By formalizing consensus-seeking behavior as reinforcement learning, the project contributes in several ways to the behavioral and neuroscientific literatures on social conformity. In particular, the reinforcement learning framework provides a mechanism for how apparently inconsequential consensus decisions may be motivated by previously acquired valence, and for how that valence may then be transferred to other contextual and interpersonal features. This approach bridges a critical gap, at both neural and behavioral levels, between complex socio-cognitive representations and basic mechanisms of reward-based learning and decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has traditionally been argued that the Mayan civilization developed from a geographically 'Olmec' predecessor and is thus derived. Work by Inomata and Triadan in southern Mexico potentially challenges this hypothesis and suggests a more complicated narrative which includes not only potential inter-regional interaction but also an underlying shift in subsistence practices from part to full time agriculture. The question is important because complex societies developed at roughly the same time in many regions of the world and scientists wish to understand what factors underlie this process. The project directed by Dr. Inomata and Dr. Triadan will contribute to the cross-cultural understanding of how interregional interaction affects the process of political transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will examine multiple sites located in the Middle Usumacinta region of southern Mexico, located between the Maya lowlands and the Olmec heartland. The project research will include: 1) airborne laser survey (LiDAR); 2) the ground-truthing of LiDAR data through pedestrian surveys; and 3) excavations of the known sites and those located in the LiDAR survey to examine their chronology. The largest site in the region, Aguada F'nix, includes a rectangular platform, measuring 1.4 km in length. The study of those poorly-known monumental constructions dating between 1000 and 700 BC may transform our understanding of social processes leading to the development of Maya civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The speed, accuracy, and precision of this equipment is enabling the Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab to conduct cutting-edge eye tracking research in a number of vital areas. For example, the eye tracking system, which detects subtle differences in eye movements by recording up to 2,000 distinct data points per second, is being used to distinguish subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Other research is using an innovative methodology to assess how individuals with dyslexia deploy their attention while reading. Results of this study will lay a foundation for designing reading interventions for beginning readers with dyslexia, a disorder that affects 10-15% of children in the U.S. The acquisition of the EyeLink 1000 Plus system is significantly expanding both basic and applied research and research training opportunities for UVU faculty and students alike, and opening doors to interdisciplinary collaborations with faculty at UVU and other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research investigates visual attention in several areas: ADHD, dyslexia, comparative cognition, and two-dimensional visual perception. It will contribute to a substantially growing body of research examining the development of oculomotor control in atypical populations by attempting to distinguish eye movements across ADHD subtypes. Using the EyeLink 1000 Plus system to record high-resolution data on simple oculomotor tasks has the potential to identify core cognitive impairments in a more clear-cut manner than existing approaches. The research includes six oculomotor versions of traditional neuropsychological tests to examine common areas of executive deficits seen in ADHD: activation, attentional orienting, set shifting, spatial working memory, stimulus suppression, and response suppression. This basic attentional work will provide a foundation for applied clinical investigations by other researchers. In order to better assess how individuals with dyslexia deploy their attention while reading, children and adults with dyslexia are being exposed to a series of single sentences that will include dynamic changes of upcoming words not currently fixated (i.e., within the parafoveal). The results of this work will inform revisions of models of normal reading to accommodate dyslexia and provide recommendations for creating standardized stimuli for future dyslexia reading research. The instrument will also enable research related to the perception of perspective within two-dimensional representations. The long-held assumption is that orthogonal lines drive the movements of the viewer's eyes. The research is testing this claim by recording eye movements of novice and expert art viewers as they view photographs and paintings with strong or weak depth cues. Researchers will test the hypothesis that experience rather than the lines themselves direct the eyes. The opportunity to participate in cutting-edge, transformative research facilitated by the acquisition of the EyeLink Plus 1000 system will be extended to women and minority students, who participate in high numbers in the behavioral sciences at UVU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current empirical evidence on these tradeoffs is both limited and ambiguous, with some studies finding a substantial productivity cost of pollution mitigation and others finding evidence in favor of the Porter hypothesis.

In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations.

Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data.

These methods of coping may have benefits, such as social support during religious observance or relaxation while hiking in a forest. However, these coping strategies also share an unstudied element that may affect how well people cope with stress: the experience of awe. Awe is an emotion that comes from being in the presence of something so large or vast that it is difficult to make sense of it. An example is being immersed in a grand natural scene. This project aims to understand when and why awe helps people to cope better with stressful situations faced in everyday life, such as test taking, public speaking, or experiencing physical discomfort. Understanding the role of awe in effective coping can help to identify relatively simple techniques that people can use to help themselves rise to the occasion during something stressful rather than be overwhelmed by it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on the idea that awe makes people feel like they and their concerns are small in comparison to whatever induced that sense of awe. The specific nature of this experience should have important, and possibly contradictory, effects on coping with stress. If something that inspires awe makes a stressful situation seem negligible in comparison, that stressful situation should seem more manageable to cope with. In contrast, if something that inspires awe makes one's own capabilities seem insignificant, the stressful situation should seem less manageable. A set of studies assess personality characteristics and experimentally create psychological states that should make these types of focus during awe more versus less likely. Multiple methods will be used to study these effects, including measurements of bodily responses and behavior. This will allow tests of awe's effects on people's psychological experience as stress happens and on behaviors that can be self-destructive in the context of facing difficulties. The long-term goal of the research is to achieve a deeper understanding of when and why awe helps people cope with everyday stressors. Understanding simple ways to foster positive responses to everyday stressors can enhance resilience in people's lives, thereby improving well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While instruments for assessing the psychological characteristics of persons have been well developed, parallel instruments for situations have lagged far behind. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that small changes in situations can create large change in behavior; however, the impact of real situations that people actually experience has rarely been investigated. The proposed research will fill these important gaps, and examine the nature of situational transitions, their antecedents, and their consequences in daily life. The results will afford a better understanding of the relationship between personality, situations, and behavior as they naturally occur. Moreover, the proposed research has the potential to be transformative by providing a template for investigating psychological processes in natural environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the study aims, the proposed research will capitalize on several recent methodological and technological advances. First, Ryne Sherman (Florida Atlantic University) and his colleagues have developed a psychometrically valid way to measure situations, which will be used in project. Second, it has been difficult to study real world situations due to a lack of technology for collecting information about situations as they are experienced in real time. This research will utilize advances in mobile sensing technology, which can visually capture the situations experienced by a participant. These images will later be rated by both participants and coders. Data analyses will examine associations among elements of situations, personality traits, and specific behaviors. The novel methodological approach developed in this project could be applied to other important questions, such as how naturally occurring situations affect outcomes such as aggression, relationship satisfaction, or well-being."

Justin,,Fine,Justin.Fine@asu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,08/31/2023,449383.00,"This project focuses on understanding how people learn, plan, and execute hand movements to grasp and use objects. For example, how does a person lift a cup of coffee without spilling or a factory worker line up a Phillips-head screwdriver with the grooves on a screw? Although we perform these tasks routinely without giving them too much thought, dexterous manipulation is one of the most complex and least understood human skills and one that still limits the utility of robots in industry. Of particular interest is understanding the brain mechanisms that allow people to learn to manipulate an object one way (e.g., to lift a mug by the handle) and then apply that knowledge differently (e.g., to lift the same mug by its sides). The investigators are working towards a comprehensive theory, at both the neural and behavioral levels, of how people learn and generalize these hand-object interactions. The results may inspire new robotic manipulators that are more dexterous, with human-like ability to generalize a learned motor behavior to novel contexts. The work may also influence development of more dexterous neuroprosthetics. The project's other broader impacts include a public lecture and discussion on the social and ethical implications of human-robot systems and participation in the ""Science Cafe"" series hosted by the Arizona Science Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work by the investigators has provided evidence for two scenarios for learning how to manipulate objects. In one scenario, people build a high-level (i.e., task-level) representation of object manipulation, which allows them to generalize the learned manipulation to a different context. For example, people successfully manipulate an object even after a finger is removed from, or added to, the object's contact surface or when the object is manipulated by the contralateral arm. In a second scenario, people build an effector-level representation. In this case, they persist in generating the same finger placement and forces despite a new context that requires different solutions, as when an object with an asymmetric mass distribution is rotated. What are the neural mechanisms involved with promoting or interfering with generalization of learned hand-object interactions? Can neural representations at the task level - enabling generalization - be built following repeated exposure to a different manipulation context? These questions represent a significant gap in our understanding of skilled object manipulation. The overall goal of this collaborative research is to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying task- and effector-level representations of hand-object interactions. The studies will record finger position and forces utilized when grasping objects in order to probe the influence of the context in which a given hand-object interaction is learned. Electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to determine the neural correlates of successful and unsuccessful generalizations to new contexts. Quantification of these behavioral variables and the corresponding brain mechanisms will provide insights into how objects are mentally represented and how these representations underlie planning and execution of dexterous manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A comprehensive analysis of this issue has been hindered by the lack of data linking firms, workers, and labor markets over time. This project will use the universe of linked corporate and household tax filings from the U.S. to examine firms, value added, workers, earnings, households, income, and the governments' tax receipts and transfers. The project will address questions on how government policies may affect inequality and uncertainty in the economy. The project will further deliver aggregate statistics on these measures, which will serve the broader community by providing input to relevant policy issues and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using detailed data and new statistical methods, the project will decompose earnings inequality into the components due to (i) worker differences in skill levels, (ii) firm differences in pay for the same skill level, (iii) the sorting of high-skilled workers into high-paying firms, (iv) the productivity complementarities arising from firm-worker matches, and (v) the pass-through of firm productivity shocks. Then, the project will derive and estimate a structural model of labor market monopsony that is consistent with empirical findings and use the model to address questions on the impact of government decisions on inequality and volatility. The project will further examine how labor markets differ between the U.S. and Europe. Also, by utilizing procurement auction data, the project will measure the rate at which demand shocks are passed through to workers by their employers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically focused on terraced landscapes, the scientists will investigate how key cultural (e.g., population density), ecological (e.g., soil and topography), and climatological (e.g., annual precipitation) factors influence changing patterns of agrarian land use. Previous research has documented discrete systems of terracing in parts of the lowlands, importantly demonstrating that these landscapes were sometimes intensively curated and cultivated. Combining soil science, paleoethnobotany, remote sensing, and archaeology with existing ""big environmental data"" (LiDAR surveys of Above Ground Carbon Storage), the research will investigate these agrarian systems across ecologies and settlement patterns, critically evaluating the resilience of these systems across the Maya lowlands. Are terraces constructed only in response to population pressure? Why are terraces built in particular regions? Why do they endure in certain ecological settings and not in others? Does terracing in the lowlands increase local landscape resilience? Do communities maintain terrace systems once they are built? Throughout the world, questions of landscape resilience, especially related to smallholder agriculture are vitally important to address, so that we can better design, plan, organize and maintain systems that are resilient to cultural and ecological change. This project fosters international collaborations and provides research opportunities for enhancing student engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the long-term landscape impacts of increasing agricultural intensity in the Maya lowlands of southern Mexico. It will inventory and analyze remote sensing (LiDAR) transects extending from the states of Chiapas north to Yucatan and Quintana Roo. Originally collected for environmental purposes as part of the REDD+ carbon inventory of southern Mexico, these surveys offer a uniquely expansive survey of human modified landscapes and landscape resilience. Specifically, it will explore how the form and spatial distribution of Pre-Columbian intensive agricultural modifications of the landscape are influenced by settlement density. The research will also study the influence of local environmental variability on the form and distribution of terracing. To address these questions, the team will process, analyze, inventory, and annotate existing LiDAR transects from across the Maya lowlands. This information will be combined with regional environmental data, excavation, soil profiles, and new high precision UAV LiDAR field surveys in order to evaluate land use intensity and land use change.

HVHF is a technique for producing oil and gas from shale formations that has revolutionized the domestic energy landscape. In the U.S., states are the primary regulators of oil and gas production, so there is variation in the types of and effectiveness of regulations in-use. Many of these regulations were enacted in the early-to-mid 1900s and were designed to manage conventional oil and gas production. Given the rapid expansion of HVHF across the country, this project asks whether these regulations are still appropriate, given the differences between conventional and HVHF production techniques. To answer this, the project first develops a cross-state database of regulations in-use to manage oil and gas production, which will be available online for the public, state regulators, journalists, and academics to explore how different states manage oil and gas production and how effective those regulations are. Second, the project engages landowners in focus groups to better understand the perspectives of people impacted, both positively and negatively, by the HVHF boom. Third, the project uses a series of laboratory economic experiments to advance scholarly understanding, in a controlled setting, of how different regulations incentivize individuals? decisions on whether to lease their oil and gas rights for production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars have long been interested in the linkages between governance institutions and the sustainability of common-pool resources (CPR), of which oil and gas are canonical examples. Institutions that facilitate efficient collective action are often seen as the best hope for a solution to the tragedy of the commons, and the long-endurance of institutions is often viewed as a best-case scenario. However, long-enduring institutions also lock participants in to a particular path that may or may not be efficient when exogenous changes occur. This project expands on the intellectual tradition of CPR scholars, by examining how a solution to a CPR dilemma today can exacerbate a different CPR dilemma tomorrow. The problem with such institutions is not necessarily the possibility of resource collapse (i.e. a tragedy of the commons), but rather of continued action in the face of substantially changed circumstances. CPR governance institutions can continue to be used to facilitate collective action, long after collective action ceases to be efficient or equitable for the group. Previously stable and efficient institutions may now have the effect of redistributing rents from those who are least vulnerable to the new risks introduced by an exogenous shock to those who are most vulnerable.

Previous scholarship on climate-human relationship focused on unique morphological and behavioral adaptations of early humans to hot, arid and open savanna habitats, and causally linked the dispersal of early humans with the development of savanna grasslands in Eurasia. However, evidence for an expansion of a savanna corridor at broad millennial temporal scales and/or at a global continental spatial scale is ambiguous and necessitates consideration that disparate climatic processes operating on narrower temporal scales and local spatial scales may have played a critical role in this cardinal and foundational event. Novel, state-of-the-art, complementary and interdisciplinary methods derived from archaeology and geosciences are well-placed to break new ground by focusing on seasonality and other high-resolution spatial and temporal climatic and environmental patterns as some of the driving forces for dispersal of early Homo. This collaboration of archaeologists, geochemists, paleontologists, and geologists from the United States, Israel, Republic of Georgia, and Australia will explore the unfamiliar pattern of seasonality, climate and environment which early humans faced in the Levant. Knowledge of the type, extent and degree of past biological human adaptation holds promise for illuminating issues on the distributions and capacities of modern humans in varying climatic regimes. The research will provide a platform for fostering professional and public discourse on the interactions throughout time among climate, environment, and human responses, enhancing science education across multiple academic levels, and supporting the recruitment of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through mentoring aimed to create leaders in scholarship, research and public life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will derive new data on the local climate and environment of two archaeological sites in Israel and the Republic of Georgia dating from 2 - 1.2 million years ago, which are the some of the earliest sites of humans out of Africa.

Human populations which depend on these regions for their livelihood have had to adapt to these changes and learn to manage these landscapes and their food resources over the course of millennia. Archaeology is well-positioned to understand how foragers, farmers, pastoralists, and ranchers have used these dryland resources through time in sustainable or unsustainable ways. The Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia is a yet little-studied region of dryland steppe, which has had at least 40,000 years of human occupation, and a long record of dramatic environmental change. Dr. Arlene Rosen, of the University of Texas at Austin, will lead a team of Mongolian and US archaeologists, and environmental specialists to the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in the southern Mongolian Gobi in order to study the social, economic, and environmental dynamics of human and natural systems during episodes of climate change over the past 5,000 years. The team will include Mongolian archaeologists and students whose heritage derives from a long cultural tradition of rangeland maintenance and use. The project will benefit from the exchange of information between Mongolian and US scientists about traditional herding practices, ecological knowledge, and culture histories, combined with expertise in reconstructing landscape and vegetation histories for the region. The aim is to develop a model for studying dry-land ranges of other regions as well as the Gobi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate how human inhabitants of the Gobi Desert took an active role in altering the desert-steppe environments either with purposeful intent or as a result of unintended consequences of their impact on vegetation and landscapes. It is commonly believed that ancient pastoralists accelerated desertification when they settled in semi-arid environments. However, preliminary evidence from geomorphology and archaeological botany suggests that the first cattle, sheep-goat pastoralist groups to use this region might have improved the sustainability of the area by inadvertently bringing in the seeds of northern steppe grasses along with their herds, thus improving the sustainability of their economic way of life. By excavating sites from these early time periods, the project will expand knowledge of the many ways in which these herder-hunters and later specialized herders were able to maintain their livelihood over the course of thousands of years of increasing climatic desiccation. The excavation of the Burgasny Enger site, in the Ikh Nart Reserve will provide elements of culture history, lifeways, and economic orientation through the analyses of artifacts, settlement structures and plant and animal remains. This will be paired with geomorphological studies of landscape change and water sources in the immediate vicinity of the site.

We tend to think that our perceptual experience of the cup is what determines our interaction with it. However, several studies over the past two decades have repeatedly shown that a perceptual task, like judging the size of an object or its weight, is processed by a different part of the brain than an action task, like reaching to lift the object. This project takes an alternate view, in which the brain processes the visual scene, but this process may be subject to errors (like overestimating the size of a cup or its weight). These errors are immediately detected while an action is unfolding and the subsequent movements toward the object are quickly corrected. This research plan will explore the nature of these complex corrections. It will also examine certain circumstances in which our perception is faulty while our actions are accurate. This knowledge could help people rapidly learn new visuomotor skills, such as interacting in virtual-reality environments and teleoperation. Indeed, a more comprehensive understanding of visually guided action could inform the development of these emerging technologies. Finally, discoveries from this proposal could help improve the lives of individuals with neurological disorders, which often lead to a profound loss of motor ability that significantly impairs activities of daily living. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project uses state-of-the-art virtual reality environments to test 1) to what extent humans can adjust their motor actions ""on the fly"" to compensate for inaccuracies in visual perception and 2) whether visual perception changes when smooth movement coordination cannot be achieved through motor adjustments. Three mechanistic hypotheses will be tested in which sensory-prediction errors - signals produced when sensory feedback does not match one's expectations - enhance the accuracy of action during repeated visuomotor interactions. At the core of each hypothesis is the idea that when biases in perception lead to inaccurate movements, sensory-prediction errors will drive adaptive changes across the sensorimotor system. Three non-mutually exclusive mechanisms of adaptive change will be tested: (1) Rapid re-alignment of the motor output with the physical world, (2) Changes in calibration of visual perception, and/or (3) Selective changes in the contribution of specific aspects of visual information to action. To test these hypotheses, an integrated set of behavioral experiments will be conducted, in tandem with the development of computational models to mechanistically explain the closely intertwined roles of perception and action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing studies of earlier cohorts of retirees do not fully capture the timing, sequencing, and voluntariness of short-term work-hour and workforce paths and transitions that Boomer men and women may experience. This project examines the experiences of women and men in their 50s, 60s, and 70s as they navigate later adulthood. The project assesses who is working longer, as well as the timing of exits from and reentries into employment. The project also examines whether these dynamics vary between advantaged and disadvantaged workers.  The project will assess whether working longer matters for the financial sustainability of individuals and their families, or the extent to which age-graded safety nets are effective.  Scientific advances from this work will inform the development of policy interventions promoting possibilities for working longer as well as for unpaid community engagement. These insights are key in light of the extraordinary numbers of Boomer women and men considering or undergoing labor market transitions moving them from social inclusion to social exclusion from the mainstream of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project charts patterned short-term workforce constellations, capturing similarities and differences in sequencing and timing, for over 850,000 women and men ages 50 to 75 over eight time points.

Individuals are surveyed in the CPS over a period of up to 16 months, which permits study of labor force entry and exists during that time frame.  Using sequence and multi-level analysis, the  project identifies the impacts of inequalities in patterned workforce constellations by social location, including variations by age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and nativity, in combination with geosocial locations. The project will capture the contemporary complexity, heterogeneity, and inequities in short-term 16-month work-hour/workforce and family living arrangement dynamics of Boomer women, men, and couples, examining similarities and differences in the experiences of Boomers and the cohort preceding them. The project will assess the predictive effects of resources such as prior health, income, and job tenure, combined with disadvantaged social statuses and geographical locations, on the likelihood of following particular workforce patterns, and whether these predictive effects differ by cohort and time period.

Not all children growing up in bilingual homes become equally proficient in both their languages, and there is currently no consensus about the most effective way to promote bilingualism. This project is designed to address a common question raised by bilingual parents: is it easier for children to learn two languages when different people speak each languages Bilingual children, particularly Latinx children in the United States, face a uniquely challenging linguistic environment, as they must learn two languages in the same amount of time that monolingual children learn only one. Therefore, this work will provide insights that are both crucial for the scientific understanding of bilingualism and of great interest to parents, educators, and clinicians seeking to improve language outcomes for bilingual children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been suggested that dual-language learning may be easier when each language can be associated with a particular speaker (e.g., one parent speaks one language; the other parent speaks the second). However, despite its intuitive appeal, there have been no direct empirical tests of this proposal. This research will assess whether reliable associations between speaker and language facilitate learning for Spanish-English bilingual infants and toddlers in both real and simulated bilingual environments. Study 1 will provide the first empirical test of whether bilingual and/or monolingual infants keep track of the languages used by new speakers. Studies 2 and 3 will then ask whether consistent speaker cues facilitate bilingual language learning. Study 2 will use a lab-based manipulation to test whether or not bilingual toddlers are better able to learn new labels produced by speakers who consistently use one language. Study 3 will extend these questions to real home environments and ask whether or not caregivers who consistently use one language have toddlers who show enhanced vocabulary development. Results from these studies will shed light on how bilinguals successfully navigate complex linguistic environments and provide insight into mechanisms of early learning.

Under the sponsorship of Dr. Daniel Schacter at Harvard University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist studying how remembering shapes problem solving. Converging evidence suggests that people rely on past experiences when faced with a difficult problem. Groups with known memory deficits (e.g., older adults, patients with hippocampal lesions) struggle to solve problems. Brief training in recollecting details of a recent event helps people to solve social means-end and personally worrisome problems. This behavioral work suggests that episodic retrieval contributes to problem solving, but cannot speak to the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship. Meanwhile, emerging research in cognitive neuroscience shows that internally directed cognition (e.g., future thinking, creativity) requires coordinated activity in large-scale networks that usually oppose each other. The proposed research investigates the network dynamics underlying both the benefits and costs of remembering a recently encountered solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how episodic retrieval improves and constrains solutions to worrisome problems. For the first time, the means-end problem solving task will be modified for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will either generate steps to solve problems or retrieve them from memory. Functional connectivity analyses will measure dynamic coupling between the executive control network (ECN), which typically comes on line during abstract problem solving, and memory regions in the default mode network (DMN).  While episodic retrieval clearly supports problem solving in many contexts, recent experiences can also interfere with finding solutions. Old, inappropriate ideas can lead to fixation, preventing the generation of new ideas. Participants will also generate novel steps in the presence or absence of interference from previously encoded steps. Again, functional connectivity analyses will assess how interference changes DMN-ECN coupling, as recalled steps are actively inhibited. The results will inform information-processing theories of problem solving, as well as our understanding of when and how the ECN and DMN cooperate to modulate self-generated information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This dissertation research project uses electroencephalography (EEG), a brain-imaging technique with millisecond-level timing resolution, to examine whether the brain utilizes predictive cues to anticipate a complex syntactic structure in Mandarin. This study also examines to what extent the ability to predict complex structures depends on verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, providing new insights regarding the neurological basis of language and the cognitive abilities that modulate success in language comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines what type of linguistic information is used to predict upcoming structure during processing, focusing on the prediction of relative clauses in Mandarin (e.g., the string ""Mary wrote"" in ""the book Mary wrote"").

Brain activity will be recorded via EEG while participants read sentences in Mandarin, in order to track the dynamics of predictive processing throughout the sentence.

Humans have been interacting with changing environments for thousands of years. For communities that live in remote and resource poor ecosystems, environmental changes present life-threatening challenges. Changes in subsistence practices in the past have allowed humans to adapt to environmental changes. These subsistence changes have also had a dramatic impact on the ecosystems that humans lived in with consequences for the health of communities that live in remote habitats. This project will train 3 cohorts of 8 students from diverse backgrounds (including in service teachers) that will learn a variety of transferable STEM skills to investigate the intersection of human behavior and environmental change. Multiple mentorship contexts will allow students to learn skills in a supportive and collaborative environment. This project will focus on student support and the development of cohorts who will investigate critical components of the interaction of humans and their environments. Each student will: 1) generate new knowledge by designing and conducting an original research project with leading international human biologists and archaeologists, 2) collect and analyze data using state-of-the-art methods, 3) synthesize and present the findings at follow-up workshops and professional development seminars in the U.S., and 4) engage in training on the public understanding of science with outreach coordinators at the American Museum of Natural History (New York). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU project will recruit at least 24 US-undergraduate students nationwide- focusing on students underrepresented in STEM fields. A portion of our students will be involved in a Research Experience for Teachers and use this experience to develop school curricula. Our project will focus the interaction between humans and shifting ecosystem dynamics in the past and present. Specifically, we will investigate the following questions: How do present and past populations react to changing ecological pressures? 2)What was the impact of different subsistence strategies on the ecosystem? 3) How do current communities interact with their environment to meet their water and food needs and what are the impacts of this on nutritional status, hydration status, and health outcomes? 4) How have different populations used shifting patterns of mobility and land use to address these ecological and subsistence challenges? Investigating these questions will form the basis of interdisciplinary training. Trainees will gain a series of widely applicable skills as they gain a holistic perspective on the interface between changing environmental parameters and human adaptations in a tropical arid region. Student research will be incorporated into ongoing public outreach and youth initiative programs at the AMNH.

This study will be the first to determine whether and why birth outcome inequality persists including both individual and neighborhood level determinants, holding sorting into hospitals constant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a novel dataset comprised of a cohort of 4,324 women who were recruited by their first trimester and who delivered live singleton births at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA.,  between the years 2006 and 2015. The project will use multivariate analysis to determine whether spatial inequality in birth outcomes occurs net of a wide range of individual determinants.  The project  will use clinical measures of maternal health status and exact addresses to capture neighborhood characteristics. Transportation times are computed using Google Maps API in R. Contextual sources of stress are merged with individual-level pregnancy data from two sources: (1) the 2006, 2008 and 2010 BNS (Boston neighborhood) Surveys, with linear imputations on non-survey years; and (2) annual reports from the City of Boston's 911 database and 311 databases. Contextual variables are merged with the pregnancy data in order to form a spatial weights matrix and data are analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. Lastly, the project incorporates bio-markers of angiogenesis, which are available at three points in pregnancy for a subset of the data, to perform causal mediation analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator, with women often experiencing more severe deficiency. This doctoral dissertation project applies a biocultural perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to investigate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency in both men and women, and for societies undergoing urbanization. The project not only addresses the complex interplay of human biology and culture, but also has the potential to inform public health efforts to understand and address vitamin D deficiency.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological anthropology has elaborated the tradeoffs between the need for vitamin D production and the need to avoid damage from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet rays, but unanswered questions remain regarding how vitamin D is regulated and why some individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  The primary focus has been on sun exposure, but other aspects of the current environment, and aspects of the environment experienced early in life, may be equally important.  This study will use longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, will be tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation - an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression - will be measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. The use of a biocultural anthropological approach allows for an exploration of how lived experience affects vitamin D production and well-being over the life course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the parties to these agreements demand flexibility in how policies are to be carried out in their countries, the international staff need to maintain a flexible mindset, being open to different approaches for implementing international agreements while at the same time providing impartial and politically neutral service to the delegations. This research investigates the ways that international civil servants establish and exercise this flexible mindset as they mediate between science, science policy, and international politics. This project is focused on the professional staff of the United Nations Secretariat charged with supporting operation of the UNFCCC. The research will employ ethnographic methods to uncover how the formal and informal work practices of UNFCCC staff impact the institutional environment in which policy is formed. In addition to its implications for the study of science policy, the results of this project will advance understanding of the anthropology of policy, the anthropology of bureaucratic cultures, and the role of international institutions in global governance. <br/><br/>The doctoral student on this project, will intern and rotate among three UNFCCC staff units over a 12-month period. UNFCCC staff facilitate information flow from scientific bodies to diplomats, write technical reports on science and policy, meet with parties to the climate agreement, coordinate communication, oversee audit procedures, and provide procedural assistance to delegates during negotiation meetings, among other duties. Qualitative data will be collected via participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and review of internal documents, to understand and explain the ways that the UNFCCC staff work, their understanding of that work, and the ways in which their work practices affect the larger United Nations policy making and implementation processes. Qualitative analysis techniques including text analysis, descriptive and interpretational discourse analysis, and context analysis will be applied to the data to uncover meaningful concepts, categories, and relationships. The results of the study will provide conceptual frameworks and data with which to understand the micro-dynamics of international policy making on mitigation and sustainable development efforts. By illuminating the processes by which international agreements are formed and implemented, the findings will be of value to political actors, policy makers and their staffs, and policy researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The government and other entities invest significantly in supporting wildfire risk mitigation on private property and related education to the public. This project investigates the efficacy of a relatively low-cost approach to increase citizens' engagement with these efforts, potentially increasing their effectiveness. Specifically, the project involves an experiment examining the extent to which including different types of wildfire risk assessment information (community-level, parcel-level, comparative) in the outreach material influences peoples' behavior. The experiment will also investigate the behavioral effects of including personalized and social comparison information. The behavioral outcomes measured in the experiment reflect the kinds of behaviors risk reduction education and outreach efforts across the nation are intended to promote. If found effective, the studied approach could be implemented in other areas where parcel level risk assessments exist, related to a range of hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental design applies different information treatments to direct mailings that encourages residents to access multiple sources of information provided by practitioners, including local community meetings. This design allows exploration of how existing biases may be leveraged to encourage behaviors that are individually, socially, and environmentally beneficial. From risk information seeking to mitigation activities, the behavioral outcomes that result from nudges involving personalization and social comparison will be measured across different community types in order to assess the role social context plays in such outcomes. Importantly, the project builds on a unique researcher-practitioner collaboration to conduct the study in communities in the wildland-urban interface, where residents face high risk of wildfire-related losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first project looks at how data-driven recommendations inform our decisions and how decisions in turn affect what data is collected for the recommendations.  This project is useful in understanding and evaluating the implications of the rapidly growing information technology and its use to guide our every day decisions. The developed framework also advances the knowledge on how internet platforms may collect data from individuals and use them to recommend products or to make hiring decisions. The second project looks at school applications by students and considers that students make mistakes in these applications. These mistakes in turn affect forecasting reforms in the application procedures. The third and fourth projects are theoretical tools that will be useful for researchers that work in related areas. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first project develops a conceptual framework for understanding data-driven recommendations that increasingly guide our every-day decisions by considering the feedback mechanism between the recommendations and our decisions. Understanding this feedback process identifies the nature of externalities and potential inefficiencies, leading to deeper understanding and possible policy implications about the new markets guided by data-driven recommendations. The research also addresses the concern that the increasing reliance by employers on third-party algorithms to screen job candidates may adversely affect inclusion in employment. The second project advances mechanism design in school choice by considering that students make mistakes in applications and uses this framework for school matching based on rankings and lottery. The third and fourth projects advance the state-of-the-art research in dynamic persuasion and monotone comparative statics analysis topics that are of central interest in economic theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will give a more thorough analysis of social mobility than that obtained solely on the basis of parent-child relations.  This project will enhance the well-being of society by increasing understanding of the degree and pattern of intergenerational transmission of disadvantages and advantages in key sociodemographic outcomes, which affect the well-being of individuals, families, and society as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project eliminates bias due to unobserved multigenerationally-correlated endowments through use of data on five generations available in the Utah Population Database and an innovative modeling strategy. Causal effects of parents and grandparents on children are assessed across six major sociodemographic outcomes: schooling attainment, occupation, age at marriage, age at first birth, number of children, and age at death. The project makes four contributions.  First, models of multigenerational relations that incorporate controls for unobserved multigenerationally-correlated endowments will be developed and estimated. Second, measurement error biases will be reduced by including more complete sets of members of each previous generation, up to great-great grandparents, than in prior studies. Third, the effects of sex of children and of maternal versus paternal lineage on multigenerational effects will be analyzed.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Alyssa Crittenden at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the impact of positive selection for increased copy number of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1) on the ability for humans to digest starch during the oral phase of food consumption. This project tackles unanswered questions regarding the significance of salivary alpha amylase (sAA) for starch consumption. Oral activity of sAA is the first step towards digestion of starchy foods. Yet humans have removed the need for oral digestion by externalizing food degradation through cooking, which breaks down large molecules such as starch. However it is unknown whether sAA activity during chewing is relevant for humans to digest starch. Importantly, no research exists that explores rate variation of sAA activity on raw versus cooked starch. Humans uniquely possess multiple copy numbers of AMY1, signaling a shift in dietary intake of starch. Such dietary shifts impact human health as it relates to tolerance of starch-rich diets. This project will contribute towards an understanding of human sAA genetic adaptations. Furthermore, understanding the impact of AMY1 variation on nutritional acquisition among ethnically and geographically diverse human populations helps inform dietary therapeutic strategies for metabolic disease prevention. This project uses a multidisciplinary approach to answer open questions about how dietary adaptation impacts health.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has three phases - an in-vitro modeling phase, a human participant trial phase, and a field work phase. Phase I will investigate starch digestion from exposure to sAA as a function of AMY1 copy number by measuring the reducing sugar byproducts across varying short time intervals. Histological assays will show sAA activity via the morphological changes to starch. Phase II will investigate oral starch digestion in human participants over short time intervals via oral manipulation of a starch solution. The expelled solution will similarly be measured for reducing sugars. Enzyme quantity will be measured on stimulated saliva using an ELISA kit for Amylase Alpha 1, and gene copy number will be measured using digital PCR against a reference single copy gene using DNA extracted from buccal swabs. These data will be combined with medical and dietary history data to help discover factors that influence the production and activity of sAA. Phase III entails field work to quantify chewing time allocated for orally processing starchy foods. These are valuable data to contextualize chewing for humans that subsist from foods that have not undergone extensive mechanical or thermal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Andrew,,Smith,smithar3@appstate.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,06/01/2019,05/31/2024,135388.00,"Inaccuracies in expectations and predictions about future outcomes can ruin decision making and optimal planning. One pernicious type of inaccuracy is an optimism bias, in which preferred outcomes are viewed as more likely than warranted and/or unpreferred outcomes are viewed as less likely than warranted.  Optimism biases lead to problematic individual behaviors like unwise risk taking and over-purchasing, human tragedies like deaths from engineering failures and societally important phenomena like stock market bubbles.  Motivational goals are often assumed to underlie optimism biases but there is an inadequate understanding of when different goals impact optimism, including goals that have the potential to reduce optimism and promote accuracy.  In fact, major theories assume that preferences for outcomes and expectations about the outcomes are independent, which is inconsistent with some empirical findings. The proposed research addresses this discrepancy. The research is structured by a novel Goal-Biased Expectations Framework, which posits contextual features that shape the balance between two orientations that a person can take toward forming expectations.  The balance of orientations ultimately determines whether and how goals shape expectations.  The framework is also useful for developing steps to debias or reduce overoptimism and promote accuracy among professional forecasters and the public.  Debiasing overoptimism can yield improved predictions and ultimately better planning, preparation, and outcomes across many contexts (e.g., financial, health, security).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three lines of experiments will be conducted.  One line will examine the scope of, and processes responsible for, a crucial difference in how measures of expectations are affected by outcome desirability or preference.  Past research findings have returned quite different indicators of the extent to which outcome desirability has a biasing influence, but these differences might align with a distinction between two ways in which expectations are commonly solicited in studies and in everyday contexts.  A second line will address how types of available information influence the desirability bias.  One surprising possibility is that as information becomes more clear, people's orientation and goals shift in a manner that produces more bias rather than less. A third line will test a novel debiasing intervention for overoptimism.  Participants in the studies will include sports fans, owners of homes in floodplains, and patients?three groups known to exhibit overoptimism. All of the proposed work will inform the validity of the Goal-Biased Expectations framework.

Federal policy encourages and indeed requires in many cases that researchers make available for re-use research datasets created as a result of federally funded research projects.  A number of previous studies have found that although scholars widely affirm the value of research data sharing in principle they have often failed in practice to share their own data in formats that are accessible for re-use.   This project investigates the reasons for the divergence between the ideals of open science and actual practice to provide an evidence base for the development of more effective and efficient policies for data sharing and to facilitate development of university infrastructure to better support research data sharing.  The results of this research will contribute to the development and implementation of data sharing policies that are more effective in facilitating data re-use while reducing the cost to investigators and universities of compliance with these policies.  Enhanced data sharing will, in turn, contribute to more rapid scientific progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project coincides with a new institutional initiative at Iowa State University to establish more robust institutional support for the ideals of data sharing and re-use, and a central question in the investigation is what institutional approaches are most effective in supporting increased data sharing.  An initial survey of faculty and research staff will be used to establish a baseline measure of existing formal and informal practices for data sharing and data re-use and their variations by discipline, career stage, and other investigator characteristics.   A follow up survey administered 18 to 24 months later will assess the impact on data sharing of new university policies and infrastructure to support data sharing.

How do collective  memories form? To a large extent, the formation of collective memories occurs through acts of communication.  One person might talk to another person about a past event, or one person might watch a video about an event on the Internet. Eventually, some of these memories are propagated throughout the group. The present research examines how acts of person-to-person communication can establish, strengthen, change and weaken what people remember of their own and others' collective past.  It tests the mechanisms by which this interpersonal influence can spread across a network, affect the memories of those with whom there is no direct connection, and in so doing, have a marked effect on the collective memory formed across the network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three sets of experiments are proposed. Using a modified version of the serial reproduction task, the first set examines the extent to which the three conversational influences of interest - reinforcement, induced forgetting, and the implantation of memories - spread across transmission chains of various sizes. It tests whether the extent of this propagation is a function of the strength of these conversational influences and whether these strengths, in turn, are a function of social relationships and the medium of communication. The second phase explores mnemonic convergence, that is, the extent to which a chain of individuals converges onto the same shared memories. Specifically, it investigates whether the extent of propagation can not exceed the length of the transmission chain if convergence is to occur. The third phase moves beyond transmission chains to complex social networks. It now probes for the degree to which mnemonic convergence is a function of both the extent of propagation, or in turn, the strength of conversational influences, and the average length between all pairings of individuals in the network. It also introduces cluster coefficients as an additional variable of interest. The proposed research brings together for the first time two strands of relevant research:  the burgeoning experimentally-based psychological literature on the effect of communication on memory in dyads and the widely discussed work on the propagation of influence through social networks. This synergistic approach produces a model with great general applicability, particularly in the domain of national security. Its interdisciplinarity will link psychological research on individual memory with work on networks and social connectedness. As a result, graduate students working on the proposed research will receive a unique training.  Overall, the proposed research provides an empirical foundation for a model of collective memory formation that will impact on societally important issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2006, the US Department of Defense developed for the first time official criteria for the use of FDA-approved psychiatric medications ""in theater"", in the physical and tactical spaces of military operations including active combat. Conservative estimates suggest that 1 in 6 service members is now taking at least one psychiatric medication. The use of psychiatric medications by the US military has attracted public attention, and is poised to influence the ways that Americans think about soldiering and the nature of war. Studies on the topic remain largely theoretical and center on the ethics of military psychiatric medication use. This project aims to understand how these medications are prescribed and used in practice, as well as how military service members understand medication effects on the work of counterinsurgency. The results from this study will have important implications for public knowledge and policy, as well as for veteran advocates and clinical practice aimed at the post-service transition of veterans. The project fosters the inclusion of underrepresented student veterans in military and veteran-related academic research and to support diversity in social and behavioral science. It will do so by 1) mentoring student veterans, 2) bringing together researchers and veterans in a symposium to address ways forward for collaborative research, and 3) publishing a co-edited volume on this important topic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jocelyn Chua of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will explore how psychiatric medications have been assimilated into the operations, infrastructures and norms of post-9/11 counterinsurgency, how these medications are understood and experienced by soldiers, and what impact these medications have had on the cultural landscape of soldiering in the U.S. Given the Army's prescription trends and prominent role in ground combat operations compared with other military branches, the research will focus on the US Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. The PI and research team will use in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation to understand the formal and informal ways that psychiatric medications are being prescribed, accessed, used, and shared. The research team will also assess enlisted soldiers' experiences of psychiatric medication use in deployment and their evaluations of the propriety of these medications to counterinsurgency soldiering.

It permits purchase of 3 Nvidia dual V100 GPUs to enable theoretical advances and practical applications in interdisciplinary understanding of learning. Rutgers-Newark is undertaking a multiyear effort to build strength in interdisciplinary computer science to support research training, and to address issues of diversity and representation within computer science and data science. These resources would: (1) enable the application of computationally-intensive methods in order to develop new theories and tools to understand human and machine learning; (2) support existing cross-disciplinary training efforts, such as graduate-level courses centered around deep learning and Deep Gaussian Processes; (3) enhance existing funded research by allowing the deployment of advanced data-analytic methods. The GPU cluster will provide a common computational resource for researchers from the Computer Science, Psychology, and Neuroscience departments through which they may collaborate to advance the state-of-the-art in each field. This purchase will complement the existing high-performance computing infrastructure already on campus as well as a recent NSF-supported purchase of a 1.2 petabyte storage system for cataloging the dynamics of human visual experience. Also, it will supplement an NSF-sponsored Mobile Maker Center for community-based data collection and fMRI research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans remain the most powerful and impressive available models of learning, although the roots of these abilities are not fully understood. Although machine learning methods have become exceptionally powerful in recent years, they remain opaque in ways that human learning is not and still require vastly more data, energy and compute power than human learners. Both human and machine learning would benefit from the ability to more tightly connect and study the strengths of each. Gaussian processes provide one such unifying framework. They are an object of interest in machine learning, where they have dual interpretations as regression models and as neural networks, as well as in human learning where they have been proposed as models of cognition and perception. These multiple interpretations of Gaussian processes are key to their interest for bridging human and machine learning. From a theoretical perspective, Gaussian processes are equivalent to (a specific type of) neural network, but much more amenable to mathematical analysis, and can be stacked to obtain Deep Gaussian processes. This Deep learning framework may allow more systematic mathematical analysis than other Deep learning approaches---for example the ability to derive explanations for their inferences. The primary research goal of this project is to use the GPU cluster and the investigators' interdisciplinary expertise to draw deep connections between machine learning and human learning perspectives to advance the state of the art in both, while also improving data analytic capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can result in significant conflict in any collaboration, but international collaborations pose unique challenges with respect to ethical issues and conflict related to scientific authorship. Social norms about scientific authorship differ markedly across national contexts in ways that may create confusion or conflict to an extent not typical in domestic forms of scientific collaboration. This project will explore these issues by studying international norms surrounding scientific authorship, sources and explanations for conflict surrounding authorship in international collaborations, and the extent to which the society in which a researcher lives shapes their ideas about authorship practices. In doing so it will identify roadblocks to effective international collaboration, and develop a set of best practices and a set of guidelines to address sources of conflict in scientific authorship. Findings will also be used to develop educational materials on these issues for domestic and international scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cross-national study of authorship norms and of conflict surrounding issues of scientific authorship will develop a social survey for national and international dissemination across a wide array of scientific disciplines. This project will expand upon a previous study by these investigators in which they researched these issues in two disciplines across four nations. Surveys for this project will be based on those from the pilot study and will be translated into thirteen languages and administered to scientists working in eighty-two nations in a wide-variety of disciplines. The survey will consist of demographic questions, open-ended responses, and Likert-scale survey items measuring levels of agreement and disagreement about authorship practices in international collaborations. The survey will yield qualitative and quantitative data that will be analyzed using established qualitative and quantitative analysis software. Findings from the study will be disseminated in publications and conferences, and through their integration into existing training modules for promoting responsible conduct of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, there is a large body of theoretical and applied literature spanning microeconomics, behavioral economics, marketing, and psychology, suggesting that often individuals do not actually consider every alternative in the feasible set before making their choice. There is also a wide literature documenting that individuals' preferences -- their tastes over different products -- exhibit large heterogeneity even within a group of individuals with similar characteristics. The investigators put forward two broad classes of empirical models of discrete choice that allow both for unobserved heterogeneity in the collection of alternatives that the individual considers, i.e. ""consideration set"", and in the preferences that each individual holds. In one class of models, heterogeneity in preferences and heterogeneity in consideration sets are allowed to depend on each other. This research develops a method to estimate the distribution of preferences and/or consideration sets, and conduct inference on the estimated distributions. It also develops a method to estimate (and conduct inference on) the welfare effect of policy interventions, e.g. ones that make consumers more aware of specific products or product attributes, or those that change the set of products in the market, etc. A primary output of this research is a collection of portable computer programs implementing the methodology, that will be shared with the community openly and free of charges or restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research puts forward new empirical models of discrete choice with unobserved heterogeneity in consideration sets. In the models considered in this research, decision makers are heterogeneous both in the products they consider and in their preferences. The first class of models places no restriction on the consideration set formation process and, in particular, allows for unrestricted forms of dependence of the decision maker's random consideration set with her preferences and with the observable characteristics of the available alternatives. Due to its flexibility, this model is partially but not point identified. The second class of models assumes specific distributions (known up to parameters) for the random consideration sets, building on recent theoretical advances in the microeconomic theory literature on limited consideration/attention. It then aims at providing weak conditions to achieve non-parametric point identification of unobserved heterogeneity in preferences, as well as identification of the distribution of consideration sets. This research aims at suggesting specific estimators/inference methods for the point or set identified distributions. This research further develops computer packages that empirical researcher can use to implement the methods, and that will be shared with the community openly and free of charges or restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contemporary gender inequalities in economic arenas are linked to a legacy of legal inequalities initially enacted in civil property and family law. This project seeks to examine how and why certain family and property laws were adopted, in order to identify the historical processes that have shaped modern gender inequalities. In doing so, the study will provide insight into economic and political inequality in the United States and globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legal foundations of modern nation states and economies emerged throughout Western societies in the 18th and 19th centuries, as numerous countries adopted nationally standardized civil law regimes with complex systems of property rights. This project will investigate the cross-national and cross-time variation in civil laws in order to identify the political processes informing which laws were adopted. Further, it will test the degree to which conflicts over economic and political resources drove these legal and political outcomes. Empirically, the project will examine developments in France and more broadly in Europe and will produce two novel datasets. The first subnational dataset will leverage a set of documents containing reform demands, written on the eve of France?s 1789 revolution, to create a geographically comprehensive source of public and elite opinions on legal reform and women?s rights. The second dataset will provide cross-national quantitative indicators of women?s property rights in the late 18th and 19th centuries.

The Approximate Number System (ANS), a cognitive system which is operational from early infancy onward, allows humans to approximately quantify sets of items without language or symbols. Research suggests that the ANS could potentially support arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, and that the ANS could therefore serve as a bridge to learning formal mathematics. However, the arithmetic capacity of the ANS, and how this capacity develops, is not well understood. This project fills that knowledge gap by systematically examining the computational capacity of the ANS using a series of experiments designed to assess young children before they learn the formal rules of arithmetic in school. The project addresses theoretical debates about the early cognitive architecture of the ANS and its role in arithmetic computation. The project will identify potential ways that educators could leverage children's pre-symbolic mathematical intuitions in order to help them learn formal mathematics. This has implications for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the degree to which computations performed over ANS representations parallel true arithmetic computations.  The development of the computational capacity of the ANS will be examined.  Symbolic arithmetic computation obeys a set of functional rules. For example, the result of an arithmetic computation like 5+6 is a new, independent quantity that is just as precise as the quantities it was derived from, and which can be manipulated and used in further computations. These functional rules make symbolic arithmetic computation both powerful and flexible. This project aims to identify the functional rules of non-symbolic arithmetic with the ANS. In a series of experiments, four to six year-old children will be asked to solve non-symbolic problems with unknown addends (e.g., 5+__=11). This task requires children to perform arithmetic-like computation, holding two separate ANS representations in mind (e.g. approximately five and approximately 11) and performing a computation over them (e.g. subtracting approximately five from approximately 11) to derive a solution. Each experiment is aimed at examining different components of the functional rules of non-symbolic arithmetic, including the representational structure and precision of the solutions to ANS computations and the extent to which these solutions can be used in further computations. Additional measures of working memory capacity, symbolic math performance, and ANS representational precision are used to elucidate contributions of these cognitive systems to the computational capacity and development of the ANS. Data will be analyzed using a combination of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factor analysis, and logistic regression. The project will therefore compliment what is known about the representational structure of the ANS by shedding light on its computational architecture and the development of this architecture in early childhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How do children understand when attorneys are attacking the credibility of their reports, and how does the subtle phrasing of attacks influence children's responses? This investigation will assess how attorneys are questioning children in recent cases of alleged sexual abuse, as well as how children understand and respond to such questions. The findings can provide concrete recommendations for those questioning children about alleged crimes, helping to establish productive techniques that elicit accurate responses. In doing so, the proposed research has the potential to improve legal decision making in cases involving children, by providing questioning methods that better distinguish true from false allegations of abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will utilize a mixed-methods approach. First they will conduct a systematic field assessment of how children are questioned in recent cases of alleged abuse.

Second, a series of laboratory studies will assess children's comprehension and response patterns to such questions, with the materials developed in tandem with the findings from the field assessment to approximate courtroom questioning. In the laboratory studies, the researchers will also include questioning alternatives not used frequently by attorneys. Such findings will assess the boundaries on what children understand.

These technologies depend strongly on the power to tie brain signals to (intended) actions.  In this project, we use state-of-the-art methods in cognitive science to develop a precise mathematical model of the link between brain activity and human behavior.  Our theory now needs to be tested with new experimental data in adverse conditions.  The challenges that will test whether this model can predict the brain-behavior link in new experiments, new behaviors, and new measures of brain activity.

Intelligent machines can use massive data to learn to identify patterns that are similar to learned examples, but people can use very small amounts of data to discover deep similarities between situations that are superficially very different (e.g., engineers have devised a cooling system for buildings using principles adapted from termite mounds). This type of creative thinking depends on analogy: the ability to find and exploit resemblances based on relations among entities, rather than solely on superficial appearances. The present investigation aims to show how relations can be learned from examples (in the form of either texts or pictures) and then used to reason by analogy. The work integrates recent advances in machine learning with more human-like learning mechanisms. Improved analogy models will increase the power of computer-based information retrieval, allowing both text and pictures to serve as retrieval cues to search large databases for items that are analogous in relational structure.

This project develops computational predictive models of how the human brain encodes speech, using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients to validate these models. The outcome of this project is immediately applicable to understanding communication disorders and to the development of neural prosthetic systems that aim to dramatically improve life for large patient populations with disordered speech function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defining the basic neural mechanisms supporting speech comprehension is a fundamental challenge for clinical insights into communication disorders such as aphasia or dyslexia. Better understanding of the neural basis of speech may also enable development of neural prosthetic devices for disabling neurological disorders affecting communication ability (e.g., ALS or stroke). Humans fluidly understand speech despite large variations in speakers and environmental conditions, such as speaker identity, rate, and background noise, but the underlying neural representations that support this invariant speech recognition ability are unknown. We will establish and test computational models of the invariant neural representations used by the human auditory system to achieve reliable speech comprehension. An important application of this knowledge is the development of robust neural decoding algorithms that can be used in neural prosthetic systems designed to restore conversational speech to individuals with disabling language disorders. To achieve these goals, this project will investigate intracranial responses to speech measured with high density electrode arrays implanted in the auditory cortex of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures. The first aim will investigate neural encoding of invariant speech representations believed to comprise key organizational units of spoken language, including phonetic and syllable structure. The second aim develops a novel machine learning framework to build decoding models directly from neural data recorded during intended silent (imagined) speech. This research program will provide new quantitative tools to understand neural mechanisms of speech comprehension and imagery in the human brain with a goal to advance application of these findings toward development of neural interfaces to restore natural speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, it investigates how the effectiveness of these policies is affected by countries' income distribution, entrepreneurial activity, government centralization, and concentration of utility assets.  This study uses data compiled by the IEA and the World Resources Institute.  Findings from this project promise to advance the field of policy research and especially our understanding of consequences of the rapid diffusion of policy instruments around the world.  By determining how national conditions such as entrepreneurial activity weaken or strengthen the potency of policies, results also can aid government decisions about which evidence-based programs are best suited for promoting a particular nation's health and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data for this project comes from merging the WRI's newly created Power Watch dataset on the emissions and water usage of over 20,000 power plants in 190 countries (2004 to 2014) with the IEA's database on domestic policies.  The following hypotheses are tested: 1) policies are more likely to decrease emissions in countries with less inequality, 2) policies are more effective in settings that strongly support entrepreneurial activity, 3) policies on use and policies on effects work less well together within moderately centralized governance systems, and 4) policies are more apt to increase the emissions and water consumption of plants when the plants are owned by companies that dominate domestic electricity markets.

While these relationships are firmly established, their mechanisms are not well understood. Aggregated measures of input (e.g., total words) and outcomes (e.g., vocabulary size) track the consequences of multiple years of learning, but this ignores how children acquire language knowledge through iterative encounters with sentences. To observe this process directly, the present project combines high-density input recordings, eye-tracking methods, and computational modeling to isolate the cues that children use to interpret sentences and how strategies vary with input differences. At a scientific level, this research provides a framework for comparing systematic variation across social groups. While existing models of acquisition assume that the convenience sample (i.e., higher-SES children) offers a suitable proxy of learning in all children, this project tests an alternative hypothesis that SES-related differences in input affect what information children attend to when listening to sentences. Isolating between-child differences in comprehension will reveal strategies that learners must acquire to interpret new sentences. At a societal level, learning and communication depend on accurately interpreting sentences. Describing children's comprehension strategies enables better predictions of future outcomes and offers methods for targeting multiple pathways by which early language can affect academic performance. This framework will benefit other populations whose input differs from mainstream peers, e.g., dual language learners, cochlear implant users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the sentence-level processes that mediate between parental input and language outcomes, the present project examines how language experience influences comprehension strategies in 5- and 6-year-olds from varying SES backgrounds. This project tests the hypothesis that input properties regulate what cues are informative for interpreting sentence meanings. For higher-SES groups, greater input quantity supports learning of fine-grained word properties, and increased word diversity enhances the need to access detailed patterns when interpreting sentences. For lower-SES groups, however, decreased quantity and diversity make coarse-grained patterns more useful, both because they require less input to learn and imply similar meanings when words occur in canonical sentence frames. This project measures word-specific and sentence-frame patterns in parental input using high-density recordings of utterances, and distinguishes children's sentence interpretations using eye-tracking experiments. Computational models combine these data to derive child-specific estimates of reliance on fine-grained word knowledge versus coarse-grained frame knowledge during comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teams constitute the social engines that drive new developments with an increasing dominance in science and technology. Nevertheless, little is known about the process through which teams succeed and fail as the vast majority of studies are based on observation and analysis of successful teams alone. For example, most team research is restricted to teams that successfully formed in the first place, resulting in a joint publication or patent. In reality, most teams fail, sometimes in a spectacular manner. This fact suggests that our current understanding of teams suffers from systematic selection bias where failed teams have largely been ignored because the data that trace them are much less abundant. Prior investigations have documented the career advantages teams confer on their members, but not how they influence scientific discovery and technological invention. Here by analyzing teams that fail alongside their successful counterparts across many domains and outcome metrics, this project will uncover empirically-grounded insights regarding why, how, and when teams fail. Without analyzing the many ways in which teams fail, researchers remain unable to identify robust factors associated with success. This project examines team success and failure across a broad array of science and technology-related contexts, ranging from biological, social and natural science and scholarship to technology, software, and entrepreneurship. Teams can be large or small, more or less structurally integrated, and involve distinct combinations of member roles or mixtures of prior experience. The project involves a two-stage research program to understand how successful teams of different sizes and shapes ""think differently"" and can be designed to accelerate scientific and technological development. First, the project evaluates success and failure outcomes for than 100 million R&amp;D teams over 100 years in terms of team size, network structure, role composition and experience. Second, insights developed from this investigation will enable the launch of large-scale online team experiments to isolate the causal mechanisms driving these effects. These experiments will bring certainty about critical team mechanisms and facilitate recommendations for policy that can be used to design teams optimized for specific purposes in advancing science and technology. Overall, this research promises to dramatically improve our ability to trace, assess, predict, nurture and design high-impact and highly disruptive teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, our project first involves (1) massive data cleaning and linkage between data on teams from a variety of domains in science, invention, and entrepreneurship. Then (2) team success and failure is measured at many stages, including the failure to secure funding, publish papers and prosecute patents, inject the frontier with novelty, attract scientific and technical attention, remain robust to replication, and achieve persistent influence. Next, the research (3) analyzes the impact of team size and complexity on success and failure by examining the size, complexity, role structure and diversity of experiences within teams. The project uses insights from this investigation to (4) deploy online team experiments to causally identify the influence of team characteristics on success and failure outcomes. Finally, (5) optimal teams are recommended, as also optimal team alterations or adjustments based on desired science and technology outcomes. Results from this work could influence global science and technology policy by increasing appreciation for the benefits of distinct types of teams -- small and large, simple and complex, diverse and similar -- relative to the science and technology outcomes they support, including disruption and collective advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Roger,P,Levy,rplevy@mit.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,11/01/2017,07/31/2019,115338.00,"People often mean more than they say. To take an example, imagine Adam says ""I could use a cup of coffee"" and Bob responds by saying ""There's a place called Joe's around the corner."" We understand this as a coherent exchange even though Adam's utterance wasn't phrased overtly as a question and Bob didn't explicitly say that Joe's sells coffee. Extracting this rich additional meaning requires us to consider sentences in light of both the context they are used in and the cooperative motivations of Adam and Bob in using language (what are called ""pragmatic inferences""). This project is devoted to constructing formal models of these pragmatic inferences. Modeling pragmatic inference is a major scientific challenge in the study of language and the human mind and a key to the future development of autonomous intelligent systems that can communicate with humans using natural language. Machines that can do robust language understanding in context will pave the way for societally beneficial technological applications such as adaptive intelligent tutoring and assistive technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical core of the project involves developing and extending models of pragmatic reasoning, drawing on ideas and insights from decision theory, probabilistic models of cognition, bounded rationality, and linguistics.  In particular, the work extends the recently developed family of ""rational speech act"" (RSA) models, which provides a set of formal tools that can be used to address basic challenges in psycholinguistics concerning how major principles of pragmatic inference fall out of simple assumptions about cooperativity and shared context among conversation participants. This enterprise has the potential to fill a major open theoretical gap in our scientific understanding of human language and social cognition. Project work includes developing computational Bayesian models of semantic composition and pragmatic inference and testing those models using controlled psycholinguistic experiments.  The work will also yield new models and publicly available datasets and will contribute to interdisciplinary connections by creating and reinforcing links between linguistics, psychology, and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, studying campaigns and their effects is difficult. This is particularly true when it comes to situations where numerous elections are taking place in a single country at one time. In this project, the PIs build on data that have been collected since 2002, analyzing large samples of candidate websites and conducting surveys of candidate campaigns. These data provide a holistic picture of a wide range of campaigns-both winners and losers-and offer scholars and citizens the ability to assess what campaigns do, why they do it, and how it might relate to subsequent governing. The intellectual merit to the project is that the data will allow scholars and citizens access to unprecedented data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ.  The broader impact is that the enhanced understanding of campaigns that these data will provide will enable practitioners to identify sources of political change and discuss reforms that could ultimately improve campaign quality. The project also will involve students who will learn how to conduct research and be able to use the data in their own work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States, citizens choose their representatives in part based on campaigns. Yet, campaigns are difficult to study as they involve so many candidates, many of whom run relatively low-cost, small campaigns. One way to obtain a representative sample of campaign discourse is to rely on candidate websites since virtually all candidates have websites. Websites also are ideal insofar as campaigns view them as holistic portraits of messages aimed at voters. Since 2002, the PIs have coded campaign websites and conducted surveys of campaigns. The result is an unprecedented data set of campaign behavior over-time. In this project, the PIs will extend that data into the upcoming election, which is of particular interest given increased affective polarization and incivility, and the nationalization of elections. The intellectual merit to the project is that it will allow scholars and citizens access to data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ.

This research project will study how natural disasters affect brain, thinking, and mood. Natural disasters are disruptive and affect millions of people worldwide each year, including children. Disaster experiences are associated with youth feeling vulnerable and experiencing problems at school, at home, and with peers, as well as problems with mental health and substance use. This research also examines how pre-disaster brain functioning and thinking may protect against some of the effects of disaster-related stress on youth. The funded work will likely inform local, state, and national responses to disasters, identify youth at greatest risk after a disaster, reveal patterns of resilience, and strengthen our understanding of typical child development.<br/><br/>In the year before Hurricane Irma's landfall, a large sample of children in Florida and South Carolina--who were later affected by the hurricane--began participating in a large, multisite longitudinal investigation of brain and cognitive development, the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Also studied was a large sample of control children in California, who were not affected by the hurricane. The current study will take advantage of data collected prior to the hurricane in the ABCD study, which used a battery of neuropsychological, interview, genetic, and structural and functional neuroimaging tests. Because disasters are rarely predictable, most prior studies of the effects of disaster exposure do not have access to important information about research participants' pre-disaster statuses or levels of functioning; the prospective design of the current research will avoid this problem. In addition, this research will enable data to be collected very soon after the hurricane, while the experiences of the hurricane and its aftermath are fresh. As a result, the researchers will be able to compare pre- and post-hurricane brain functioning, mood, and thinking, to test hypotheses about the effects of disaster-related stress on several developmental processes. Key predictions are that in addition to causing elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms in both cognitive and affective domains, increased hurricane-associated stress will have caused loss of volume, reduced cortical thickness, and impaired neural transmission in specific brain areas (for example, in the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and other areas). Neural measurements will be taken using T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans and diffusion-weighted MRI scans. By studying children's Irma-related experiences, traumatic exposure, and evacuation-related stress, this study will afford a unique opportunity to longitudinally examine the effects of disaster exposure and disaster-related stress on youth development. This study will help the general public better understand the effects of disasters on children and identify youth at greatest risk in the aftermath of disasters."

Paradoxically rivers fix political boundaries yet shift unpredictably across their floodplains, posing problems of jurisdiction and questions of international sovereignty. Additionally, governments manipulated rivers for irrigation, changing river channels so drastically that they no longer adhere to the boundaries they supposedly demarcate. This research examines how rivers have shaped landscapes of belonging and exclusion by focusing on socially differentiated river communities whose shared boundaries shifted when rivers shifted. In response, these communities formed alliances and negotiated conflicts among one another. The doctoral student will evaluate how communities are differentially impacted by contemporary water controversies such as drought and river restoration. Findings will be disseminated to water managers, conservation groups, and the public through publication of written materials in regional outlets and a broadly accessible book. Findings and oral history interviews will be converted into digital narratives to contribute to public debate about the contemporary legacy of past river use and development and can serve as instructional material in classrooms. Results will be shared with the relevant communities. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>Through its focus on the physical manifestation of boundaries, this project will reveal how power has been routed through rivers to shape landscapes of belonging and exclusion for different social communities. Integrating ideas from environmental history, political ecology, and borderlands studies, the doctoral student will investigate: (1) how river development in the form of dams, canals, and reservoirs made and re-made territorial boundaries separating Native American and African-American river communities; and (2) how these communities responded to shifting river boundaries through alliances, oppositions, and internal divisions to remain rooted to an increasingly managed landscape.  National archival material will demonstrate how river development caused these boundaries to shift, while local archival collections and oral history interviews will demonstrate how these local communities responded in turn.  Case studies will focus on communities that have been historically divided by changing boundaries set by this transnational, dynamic, and essential river.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is based on a comparative case study of violent crime patterns in four U.S. cities: Chicago, Boston, Cincinnati, and San Francisco. Particular attention is directed towards understanding how the topology of social networks influences the spread of crime and violence within a population, maintaining that this diffusion of crime and violence can be more fully explained by the structure of social networks than by individual or neighborhood attributes.  To that end, the project is divided into two inter-related studies. The first phase focuses on individual networks at the core of inter-personal violence. By analyzing the social networks of individuals in these four cities it examines (a) how an individual's position within a social network influence his likelihood of being shot or the victim of violent crime, (b) whether or not certain types of networks are more conducive to the diffusion of violence than others, and (c) the extent to which certain network positions are more susceptible to victimization than others.

Such processes within the brain, referred to as cognitive control, are thought to differentiate individuals in terms of mental abilities that are critical for successful navigation in activities of daily life, such as planning, problem solving and reasoning.   Current brain imaging methods enable examination of the activity and interactions among brain networks as individuals perform various tasks, thus providing a window into the mechanisms of cognitive control. However, research efforts to date have mostly used imaging data to generate snapshots of brain activity that are averaged across groups of individuals and many different events while performing a task. In this research program, the investigators develop a new form of analysis to characterize the moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity, within each individual, as they transition from rest to cognitively demanding task conditions.  In particular, efforts will be directed towards the development of a computational model that can predict how brain networks coordinate activity over seconds-level timescales in response to changing task conditions.  A key aspect of the effort will be to develop unique models for each individual, drawing from a large database of previously obtained neuroimaging data.  In these data, individuals perform a range of tasks requiring different cognitive control strategies, some proactive (sustained) versus others reactive (transient). Thus, application of the model will reveal how the brains of these individuals differentially respond to various types of cognitive demand.  The development of this model also provides a unique opportunity for education and outreach; specific efforts will be directed toward the development of a software platform through which members of the public can work with demonstration models to probe and learn about how different patterns of brain activity relate to cognitive function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functional neuroimaging has allowed for detailed spatial and temporal characterizations of brain network activation in an effort to elucidate the neural underpinnings of cognitive control. However, such analyses usually rely on static snapshots of neural activation patterns in individual brain regions and/or correlational indices of inter-regional co-activation (i.e., functional connectivity). Further progress in understanding distinctions between cognitive states and cognitive control strategies requires more precise descriptions of the brain dynamics that govern how patterns of neural activity (trajectories) evolve across time. Leveraging recent advancements in optimization theory that allow for reliable high-dimensional parameter estimation, this award will support the validation and parameterization of single-subject dynamical models using high-resolution, long-duration resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, which contains data from over 1000 individuals. Subsequent model analysis will characterize individual differences in terms of brain network dynamics, focusing on quantitative metrics of the ruggedness of the attractor landscape (which indicates the diversity of achievable trajectories) and the consequent energetic costs incurred by shifting between cognitive states and strategies. Hypothesis testing will be conducted with a unique follow-up dataset, consisting of a subset of HCP participants and monozygotic (identical) twins (over 100 in total) tracked in multiple neuroimaging sessions, under conditions that systematically manipulate cognitive control strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A main tool for estimating such structural models is inference via simulation.  For different parametrizations of the model, synthetic data is generated via the model, and the parameters generating data that most closely resembles observed data are used as estimates. Recent modern artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning for image recognition are based on this same principle. These methods have been achieving impressive results over the past years. Therefore, this research takes advantage of such powerful tools in modern pattern recognition for structural estimation in economics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research considers a set-up where individual outcomes are a known function of exogenous variables and an error whose distribution is known up to a finite dimensional vector of parameters. The goal is to estimate the finite dimensional parameter. The investigators adopt the generative adversarial network approach (GANs) to find the parameter value such that given a discriminator, a device that can accurately distinguish data generated using the model from real data, is unable to do so when the data is generated according to such parameter value. The method developed in this research differs from other simulation-based minimum distance estimators in that the distance is adaptive. That is, the discriminator learns the features of the data that are best at distinguishing real from synthetic data as opposed to hard-coding what features of the data to match. This adaptability property has proven powerful in pattern recognition tasks. In structural estimation, adaptability can translate into alleviating the curse of dimensionality, and obtaining parameters that are able to more closely match entire distributions of data, as opposed to a set of pre-specified moments. This estimation framework should be useful in applications were distributional effects and heterogeneity are first order to evaluate the effect of a particular policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will provide new spatiotemporal data and tools for the analysis of spatial change. The enhanced database is needed for basic social research and policy analysis because models and descriptions of the past underlie both theories of past social change and projections into the future. The project outcomes will be important not only for academic research, but also for social science training, journalism, policy research at the state and local levels, and private sector research. The planned improvements will expand the impact of NHGIS by making it more powerful and accessible. Data access and product enhancements will facilitate a range of new research applications and data visualizations drawing directly from the massive NHGIS data collection.

Men are more likely to be invited to talks, to have their work assigned on course syllabi, and to be contacted by the media for reactions to current events. But many social science experts are women; they are simply not as visible or well-known, and it is easier for those seeking expertise to call on those scholars with whom they are already familiar. Reducing this implicit bias against women requires positive steps to make the expertise of women more visible and easily accessible. The Women Also Know Stuff (WAKS) project does exactly that. Created in February 2016, the Women Also Know Stuff initiative is working to make it easier for scholars and journalists to identify experts who are women, through a website of women experts and an active Twitter feed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Women Also Know Stuff has worked for the past 20 months to populate and publicize a crowd-sourced online database that highlights the expertise of women scholars. The Women Also Know Stuff Editorial Board collects and manages this information with the goal of promoting women's public and professional engagement. This project will allow women listed on the website to give citations of 1) peer-reviewed published journal articles and books and 2) media interviews, by allowing them to check boxes for relevant subject areas (e.g., conflict studies, international relations) next to each citation. Icons (e.g., stars) next to the names of scholars will indicate if they have provided a linked citation for a given subject area. This system of linked citations and icons will allow users of the website to narrow their searches to only those scholars who have citations listed for publications and/or media interviews in the subject area of interest.

Economic inequality often leads to social conflicts which in turn is destructive of the economy.  The relationship between economic inequality and social conflict is complex; social conflict does not always rise with inequality.  While economic inequality increases the gain from conflict, it also increases the cost of such conflict.   It is not clear why inequality leads to social conflict and economic destruction on one context and not another.  This research project combines insights from economics, psychology, and other social sciences to develop a theory to explain the relationship between economic inequality and social conflict.   Several social and political conflicts (phenomena) can be explained with this model. Understanding the forms social conflict can take is of importance to academics as well as policy makers who may craft better policies to mitigate the effects of such inequalities.  By providing a robust explanation of the sources of social conflicts and how to reduce them, this research project will provide inputs into policies to reduce social conflicts and hence increase economic growth and prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project extends the theory of socially dependent aspirations to the study of economic inequality and social conflict.  Social surroundings affect individual's preferences through the setting of individual aspirations as the threshold between achievement and failure.  Individual's growth can be enhanced by achieving their aspirations but may also be frustrated if the aspirations are not achievable.  Because aspirations are generated by social surroundings, this leads to the interplay between the distributional character of economic development and individual behavior.  With relatively moderate inequality, aspirations are achievable, and resources are expended to achieve them; when inequality is high agents give up on achieving their economic aspirations and turn to other components of their aspirations vector.  The theoretical model can explain why direct class conflict is a relatively rare phenomenon.  This research will apply this concept to the study of contemporary social conflicts and other phenomena, such as racism and xenophobia.  The results of this research project will provide a better understanding of the sources of social conflicts and provide inputs into policies to reduce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While such change is inevitable, it is very often induced or accelerated by situations of language contact, which are increasingly common due to population mobility in a globalized world. This project will contribute to recent scholarship on grammaticalization, or linguistic change which enhances grammatical complexity as words referring to objects and actions (i.e. nouns and verbs) develop into grammatical markers (e.g. affixes and prepositions). It will do so by scrutinizing dialect divergence within Dakota (dak), a Native American language experiencing extreme contact with -- and shift towards -- English. This dialect divergence holds critical insights for theories of language contact and change, which currently maintain that extreme forms of contact yield morphosyntactic simplification and interference (grammatical borrowing) from the dominant language. As recognized in The Native American Languages Act passed by Congress in 1990, languages spoken by indigenous peoples of North America have a unique status and significance. When documenting and analyzing the progression of grammaticalization and its role in differentiating related dialects, this project will adopt a collaborative research design that enhances the participation of Native Americans in science research and strengthens STEM educator development for Native American instructors.  Other broader impacts include the professional development of a doctoral student, enhanced collaboration between a research university (University of Virginia) and a tribal college (Sisseton Wahpeton College), and the training of tribal citizens in documentary linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the Sisseton dialect of Dakota, a highly endangered Siouan language spoken in several reservation communities scattered across the Northern Plains. Because of the historical depth and richness of scholarly work on Dakota dialects, this language presents a rare opportunity to examine dialect variation and development in Native America. Yet unlike other Dakota dialects, Sisseton speech has not received sustained scholarly attention. While the little research that does exist emphasizes lexical (word) and phonological (sound system) similarities between Sisseton and related dialects, this project will analyze the Sisseton dialect's recent and ongoing morphosyntactic (grammatical) divergence. The Sisseton dialect displays evidence of enhanced grammatical complexity that elaborates the head-marking characteristics of Dakota (i.e. making grammatical distinctions on phrasal nuclei) as opposed to borrowing the dependent-marking characteristics of English (i.e. making grammatical distinctions on modifiers). In order to enrich and extend our understanding of how language change unfolds amidst situations of contact, this project will produce an accessible and archived annotated audio-visual corpus of Sisseton speech. The project will also produce a dissertation, and descriptive and theoretical findings will be disseminated via journal articles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team seeks to develop a model of how individuals make decisions. They propose a framework that could be an alternative to the standard approach of modeling economic preferences. The team wants to replace this standard approach with an alternative that can better explain results from experimental and behavioral economics. They seek to develop an approach that is quite general, so that it can be applied to any economic decision. Their model will replace the simple preference relation (which ranks all alternatives) with a concept they call a preference structure. Preference structures include two relations. The first captures all rankings that the individual finds easy or straightforward. The second relation that comes from observing how the individual makes decisions between two alternatives, whether that decision is easy or hard. The goal is to provide new methods for behavioral economics. If the project provides a more accurate way to model actual decision making that can also be used to predict future decisions, it would be useful in a wide variety of practical contexts in business management and public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model of preference structures includes two binary relations. The first captures easy rankings. As cyclical choice patterns are unlikely to rise from easy pairwise choice problems, this relation is required to be transitive but not necessarily complete. The second relation is complete, but may not be transitive. The two relations are consistent. This model subsumes many preference models, such as those that allow for indecisiveness, imperfect ability of discrimination, regret, and completions based on recommendations. Moreover, there is a natural way of modeling the choice behavior induced by a preference structure by using the notion of top-cycles. This leads to a generalization of standard rational choice theory which meets three goals. It has predictive power, it has appealing existence and uniqueness properties, and it provides ways of empirically eliciting preference structures from choice data. The team plans to explore a number of avenues, from classical consumer theory to game theory. They also hope to consider decision making under risk and uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extreme heat is the most common weather-related cause of death. A better understanding of heat wave size, intensity and drivers of these characteristics will enhance public safety by identifying where and under what conditions heat waves are likely to be larger and/or more intense, so that public health interventions such as warnings, education, and staging of cooling/hydration stations, etc. can be planned. Novel integration of methods from climatology and landscape ecology will allow for development of a spatial database of heat waves that can be used to answer questions, such as how climate and land-surface change impacts heat wave size and intensity. Broader impacts of the project include implications for public health, urban planning, and disaster management and preparedness as well as land management and policy.

The project has education and outreach activities designed to promote the inclusion of underrepresented groups and foster increased minority participation in geography and related STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the critical need to improve the spatial and temporal modeling of heat waves. Spatial analysis techniques from the fields of geography, landscape ecology, and climatology will be combined to examine the spatiotemporal evolution of heat waves. Heat waves will be tracked daily using a novel combination of simple geometric concepts, formalized as shape metrics, and a clustering algorithm. Regions within heat waves where conditions are expected to pose a significant risk to human and environmental health will be a key focus. Using statistical models and the concept of critical climate periods these regions will be linked to geophysical variables including atmospheric and land surface variables that influence surface air temperature and humidity. The two main research questions are: (1) what changes can be observed in spatiotemporal characteristics of heat waves, such as size and shape? and (2) what are the relationships among statistical characteristics of heat waves (frequency, magnitude, duration), spatial characteristics of heat waves (size, shape, connectivity), and geophysical variables?

One is that the two languages compete for selection, suggesting bidirectional cross-language influences. Another is that using two or more languages has consequences for cognitive functioning across the lifespan. However, this research has only focused on the long-term consequences of bilingualism. Therefore, it remains unknown how bilinguals draw from domain-general cognition to enable the use of language in real time. Moreover, despite the fact that bilinguals differ among themselves in their language experiences, few of the past studies examining the cognitive consequences of bilingualism have used anything more than measures of self-reported proficiency, and do not provide a comprehensive characterization of the context of language use. Critically, heritage speakers and adult second-language learners are the predominant groups of bilinguals in the US, yet little is known about how these individuals recruit cognitive resources to support the functioning of their languages in a context where one of the two languages predominates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses behavioral and neuroscientific methods to identify the cognitive mechanisms that enable heritage speakers and learners to successfully process language in real time and seeks to challenge the idea that language ability in these populations is solely determined by proficiency and/or incomplete acquisition. Using a recently-developed cross-task adaptation paradigm, the project compares performance of: 1) heritage Speakers of Spanish immersed in an English-dominant environment with Spanish-English bilinguals immersed in a Spanish-dominant environment; and 2) advanced classroom learners of Spanish with learners who are immersed in a Spanish-dominant environment while studying abroad. A key feature of the cross-task adaptation paradigm is that it provides a measure of how conflict experienced in a general cognitive task directly affects the ability to resolve conflict during language processing. Language performance is measured at the level of the lexicon and grammar, comparing comprehension and production in both Spanish and English, using behavioral measures of speed and accuracy, eye-tracking measures during sentence reading, and electrophysiological measures that examine the time course of word production. This program of research shifts the focus of attention to a more dynamic view of language and how it draws from cognition, which holds significance for shaping bilingual education in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant proportion of cases are due to household reliance on biomass fuels and exposure to airborne toxicants in biomass smoke.

Airborne toxicant exposure are already known to disproportionately impact individuals from disadvantaged socioeconomic status. This study, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirical data collection and analysis, explores variation between cultural perceptions of risk and vulnerability to pollution exposure and biological outcomes.

Groups living at high altitudes, like in the Peruvian Andes, experience not only physiological challenges but also significant environmental limitations that have the potential to drastically affect productive subsistence practices. In addition to these challenges, ancient populations were subjected to varying levels of influence of large-scale political entities such as the Inca Empire, and/or post-contact colonialism, which likely changed traditional subsistence patterns, community organization, and cultural practices. This project will investigate how individuals as well as communities were able to adapt in order to mediate the effects of environmental challenges and political/cultural changes. The proposed research will address questions surrounding how these challenges affected people's ability to subsist, how changes in political structure altered community organization and cultural practices (i.e. site usage and mortuary practices), and whether there were changes in population composition at the archaeological site of Marcajirca from the Late Intermediate Period (LIP) through the Early Colonial Period (ca. 1000-1640AD).  The goal of this research is to complement the work of and provide valuable resources to local archaeologists who are beginning to construct a more detailed picture of human habitation in previously under-researched environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Fehren-Schmitz and Mrs. Washburn will utilize a combination of stable isotope (Carbon and Nitrogen) and ancient DNA analysis in order to explore changes in socioeconomic and subsistence patterns. The use of either stable isotope analysis or aDNA can be seen in bio-archaeological projects throughout the Andes; however, it is not common practice to utilize a combination of both methodologies, which if not done has the potential to limit the scope of research projects because each set of data has usable limitations. By combining these two methodologies, this project can address questions of how environmental challenges and cultural/political stability or change ultimately affected community organization and daily life. Moreover, unlike other regions of South America, the under-representation of human aDNA data from within this region inhibits the ability to fully reconstruct South American population density, history and interaction, as well as the impact of European colonization.

Understanding this ability has been a central goal in the neurobiology of language, as well as in theoretical linguistics. However, despite a rapidly growing body of research, the brain basis of composition has been vaguely understood at best. Most of the progress during the last decade has been limited to general descriptions of the sentence level, identifying a network of brain areas recruited for the composition of sentential meaning but not further specifying how the individual facets of sentence composition are encoded. Considering the assumption in formal semantics that composition can happen via at least two different rules, understanding very basic instances of composition in various linguistic environments is an essential first step for characterizing the neural basis of sentence interpretation. To this end, this dissertation takes a bottom-up approach, investigating neural substrates of small units of composition, with its focus on English verb phrases. Disentangling the two major modes of composition around a verb, namely modification (e.g., paint + slowly) and saturation of arguments (e,g., paint + a picture), this work aims to provide an answer to the question of how the meaning of a complex event description, e.g., ""John reluctantly painted a picture,"" is composed from the various event elements, i.e., John (agent), reluctantly (manner), painted (action), and a picture (object). This work aims to lay a critical foundation for a computationally detailed characterization of full sentence composition. <br/> <br/>   This dissertation consists of three studies that take advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of magnetoencephalography to characterize the dynamics of composition. The first experiment investigates the neural signatures of modification in the verbal domain, asking how the combination of a verb and its modifier engages the brain, and how this overall pattern compares to that of noun-modifier combination, for which stable results have been described in prior work. The second experiment investigates the neural representation of conceptual specificity in the event domain. Previous literature has shown that a particular brain region, the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL), is sensitive to conceptual specificity in the object domain (e.g., boat vs. canoe). Asking whether event specificity also involves the same area in the same way, the second experiment manipulates the conceptual specificity of events (e.g., ""hoard fuel"" vs ""store fuel""). The last experiment explores situations of (possible) semantic composition in which the combining words do not form a syntactic constituent. In all, these studies combine insights from theoretical linguistics and from the psychological literature on concepts and categories to elucidate the neural reflexes of event composition as manifested in verb phrase interpretation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the functional significance of this shift in molar form, drawing upon, and contributing to, a framework that considers how dental wear alters the shape and function of teeth throughout an organism's life. This project will also provide opportunities for public outreach and undergraduate research engagement, including students traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers.

This project will use 3D dental topographic methods to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential of molars at varying wear stages in a sample of extant and fossil catarrhines (i.e., Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). First, the investigators will establish a baseline of how extant catarrhine molars are altered by macroscopic wear and use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether diet or tooth morphology has a greater influence on maintenance of shearing function. Second, these methods will be applied to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential from molars of Oligocene and Miocene catarrhines. While extant Old World monkeys have two fully developed lophs on their molars, early members of this clade exhibit partial loph development in some molars. The investigators will test whether these early stages of bilophodonty gave stem cercopithecoids greater persistence of certain tooth functions relative to their non-cercopithecoid catarrhine relatives.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Judy Gerber at Vanderbilt University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of parent strengths in predicting family reunification in juvenile dependency (i.e., child protection) cases. The burden on the U.S. child welfare and juvenile dependency system is heavy. There are 4 million reports of child maltreatment annually; the government spends billions of dollars on improving the system every year; and community providers spend countless hours delivering intensive services to families. Yet, even after these efforts are successful in reunifying children and parents, families continue to experience problems, with approximately 30% of children re-entering foster care within three years. These statistics highlight the critical need for research to determine what predicts successful, safe, and long-lasting family reunification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the study is to identify strengths (e.g., commitment, insight, social support) in a sample of parents who have recently become involved in the juvenile dependency system. The study also will examine the extent to which these strengths change over the course of parents' cases, why they change, and how they relate to parents,compliance, behaviors, and permanency outcomes (i.e., reunification and re-entry rates). Parents who have recently had children sheltered in the juvenile dependency system will be interviewed to identify these strengths. A 6-month follow-up assessment will examine changes in strengths, and will include a qualitative component to examine why families experienced changes in the strengths,notably, a component not included in current strengths-based models. Case file reviews conducted within 12 months of case opening, will determine parents' compliance with services, professionals perceptions of parents, behavior change, and reunification rates. Administrative data reviews, conducted 6 months later, will determine re-entry rates. Findings have the potential to illuminate our understanding of the mechanisms associated with family reunification. Additionally, findings will help to inform the policy contexts that shape family planning and engagement to ultimately improve the lives of children and parents, and keep families together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Steven,,Boutcher,boutcher@umass.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,07/15/2019,12/31/2021,245269.00,"Public sector employment accounts for nearly one fifth of the U. S. labor force and is an important site of employment for women, racial minorities, and middle-class jobs.  Traditionally public sector jobs have been viewed as stable, in contrast to private sector jobs that may be lost during economic downturns, as well as due to changes in demand for goods and services.  Recent events, however, suggest public sector employment may also be precarious, and we know very little about how such precarity unfolds. This project uses administrative data to systematically analyze changes to public sector work from 1974 to 2017. This project investigates: 1) the quality of public sector jobs, including pay, turnover, and full time employment; and 2) differences in employment and pay by race and gender.  The project will also chart state-level variation in these employment dynamics.  Project findings will inform policy regarding workforce supports for employees in the public sector, including the need for retraining and transition support when public sector jobs are lost.  State-level variation in such dynamics will enable policy makers at the state level to craft social supports most appropriate to their jurisdictions.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using over 7 million observations of workplace level data collected by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), this project is the first to conduct a systematic organizational level analysis of trends in public sector job quality. The project will evaluate the role of both organizational and state-level determinants of public sector employment.  It considers state level institutional forces, such as union strength, political composition, and local economies, as well as organizational level factors, such as managerial composition and preexisting racial and gender segregation by workplace.  The project will examine these dynamics descriptively for all US states from 1974 to the present and then statistically model dynamic change at the workplace level using error correction modeling, followed by fixed effects analyses.  The project will contribute to the Relational Inequality Theory framework, thus enriching knowledge through in-depth study of how public sector organizations influence employment dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines the causes and consequences of women’s exclusion from, and appointment to, three of the most powerful cabinet posts: defense, interior/home affairs, and foreign affairs. These prominent positions policy influence and it is thus vital to explain when, why, and how women access these portfolios, as well as to understand how women’s inclusion shapes policies that are central to the functioning of the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central claim of this project is that women’s presence in political office shapes, and is shaped by, beliefs about the policy responsibilities of the position. Though each of the portfolios studied has distinct responsibilities, they share a focus on security (i.e., protecting the state from domestic and international threats). The first set of hypotheses posits that women access the inner cabinet when the portfolios’ focus expands beyond traditionally masculine policy arenas (such as terrorism and war) to emphasize issues like peacekeeping and human rights. The second set of hypotheses suggests that male and female ministers’ policy priorities are largely explained by the conditions that bring women into (or keep them out of) office, rather than innate gender differences. The third set of hypotheses posits that the appointment of female ministers affects citizens’ beliefs about the aims and prestige of these positions and informs their levels of trust and confidence in the minister, the ministry, and the state. This project thus advances the scientific study of women’s political representation by collecting original data to test these hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project offers the first worldwide study of women in the inner cabinet and a framework for assessing the causes and consequences of women’s access to male-dominated posts in other realms. In doing so, the project develops a new framework for explaining when women access traditionally masculine domains and how their pathways to power affect policy outcomes and citizens’ relationship to the state, we well as compiles a global database on women’s cabinet appointments and policy outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Paul,,Allopenna,paul.allopenna@uconn.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,08/31/2022,202981.00,"One of the greatest mysteries in the cognitive and neural sciences is how humans achieve robust speech perception given extreme variation in the precise acoustics produced for any given speech sound or word. For example, people can produce different acoustics for the same vowel sound, while in other cases the acoustics for two different vowels may be nearly identical. The acoustic patterns also change depending on the rate at which the sounds are spoken.  Listeners may also perceive a sound that was not actually produced due to massive reductions in speech pronunciation (e.g., the ""t"" and ""y"" sounds in ""don't you"" are often reduced to ""doncha""). Most theories assume that listeners recognize words in continuous speech by extracting consonants and vowels in a strictly sequential order. However, previous research has failed to find evidence for invariant cues in the acoustic signal that would allow listeners to extract the important information. This project uses a new tool for the study of language processing, LEXI (for Linguistic-Event EXtraction and Interpretation), to test the hypothesis that individual acoustic cues for consonants and vowels can in fact be extracted from the signal and can be used to determine the speaker's intended words. When some acoustic cues for speech sounds are modified or missing, LEXI can detect the remaining cues and evaluate them as evidence for the intended sounds and words. This research has potentially broad societal benefits, including optimization of human-machine interactions to accommodate atypical speech patterns seen in speech disorders or accented speech. This project supports training of 1-2 doctoral students and 8-10 undergraduate students through hands-on experience in experimental and computational research. All data, including code for computational models, the LEXI system, and speech databases labeled for acoustic cues will be publicly available through the Open Science Framework; preprints of all publications will be publicly available at PsyArxiv and NSF-PAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project unites signal analysis, psycholinguistic experimentation, and computational modeling to (1) survey the ways that acoustic cues vary in different contexts, (2) experimentally test how listeners use these cues through distributional learning for speech, and (3) use computational modeling to evaluate competing theories of how listeners recognize spoken words. The work will identify cue patterns in the signal that listeners use to recognize massive reductions in pronunciation and will experimentally test how listeners keep track of this systematic variation. This knowledge will be used to model how listeners ""tune in"" to the different ways speakers produce speech sounds. By using cues detected by LEXI as input to competing models of word recognition, the work provides an opportunity to examine the fine-grained time course of human speech recognition with large sets of spoken words; this is an important innovation because most cognitive models of speech do not work with speech input directly. Theoretical benefits include a strong test of the cue-based model of word recognition and the development of tools to allow virtually any model of speech recognition to work on real speech input, with practical implications for optimizing automatic speech recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data with these characteristics commonly arise in fields such as neuroscience, the environmental sciences, and economics. Currently, there are limitations with the statistical tools available to analyze these data, particularly in neuroimaging. Some of the commonly used methods are either not able to adequately capture the complex structure underlying these data or are computationally expensive and only practically feasible in very low-dimensional settings. This project will result in improved methods that are general and therefore applicable to the analysis of data from a variety of fields. New educational and training opportunities will be provided to graduate students pursuing research at the interface between statistics and other areas such as neuroscience and the environmental sciences.

These models and related computational tools will lead to joint and fast inference on the time-varying spectral features that characterize each individual time series, as well as inference on the time-frequency relationships across the time series components in the set. Dynamic hierarchical models for analysis of multiple time series also will be developed. The hierarchical approach will borrow strength across multiple time series to make accurate inferences on their common underlying time-frequency structure. Tools for sparsity and dimension reduction in these multi-dimensional temporal model settings will be developed and implemented.

Understanding the way the brain controls the various organs and muscles of vocalization is a basic scientific question that may illuminate more general principles that can describe how the brain programs and controls all behavior.  In order to understand the neural mechanisms of motor behavior in vocal production, the proposed research will test specific hypotheses about the timing of different brain regions, the timing of muscles that produce vocal behavior, and the response to normal and abnormal auditory feedback.  Understanding the neural mechanisms of motor control can have broad implications, including the development of more human-like robots, better computer-generated speech and vocal prostheses, as well as new therapies for treating articulatory disorders such as stuttering, dysarthria, aphasia, and other problems in speech production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will measure the timing of neural circuits that control vocalization in humans and song birds.  The bird song production system has long been used as a model system that has relevance to understanding speech production. While simpler than humans and with less behavioral control of the experiments, studying birdsong is complementary in providing more granular measurements of neural activity in a vocal learning system than possible in humans. The experiments will test a novel hypothesis, that the motor system is not organized by the commonly assumed ""top down"" organizational scheme, but by a coherent network that operates as a unitary mechanism as described by certain mathematics of non-linear systems. The comparison between species will also be informative about how robust the results are across very different species and neural systems offering the possibility of generalization of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, languages aren't merely passive vehicles for the transmission of information. Rather, our sentences carry along with them evidence of the fundamental concepts and categories that we use to understand the world and each other. At one level, this fact about language might seem obvious: a person on one side of an argument might choose to use words that a person on a different side might not, and attending to these different choices tells us something about the people speaking. Such observations about language and language users are studied in fields like sociolinguistics. Yet, our language also reveals more basic truths about us which are not as easily accessible to consciousness, and which are more tied to elements of our common experience. For example, people talk as if there are objects that can be counted (""four spoons"") and substances that cannot (e.g., ""four muds"" is odd), even if arranged in discrete piles. Investigating language at this deeper level can thus reveal basic structures of thought, informing theories of cognition and its development, as well as applications in artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies parallels in the conceptualization of the basic categories 'object' and 'event' as they are encoded in language and understood by both adults and 4 year olds. Previous research in linguistics and the philosophy of language has uncovered striking formal parallels in the encoding of these categories across nominal and verbal language. The project links this research to what is known about object representation in cognitive science, and uses this link to extend what is known about event representation. Specifically, the project (i) tests whether the observed linguistic parallels correspond to parallels in how adults and children conceptualize minimally-different static and dynamic scenes, (ii) investigates the extent to which representational biases for simple dynamic scenes predicts how adults and children understand quantificational language involving words like ""more"", and (iii) probes the hypothetical universality of the language-cognition linkages by teaching English-speaking adults and children attested, but non-English patterns of event encoding. The results of this project will demonstrate the fruitfulness of connecting formal semantics, philosophy of language, and cognitive science to illuminate the interface between linguistic and non-linguistic perception and cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Steven Franconeri at Northwestern University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating ways to help people understand visualizations of data. Accurately interpreting visualizations of data is vital for success in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Scientists depend on graphics to communicate and develop ideas about data. Further, people use visualizations of data to make large-scale policy decisions, such as where to allocate resources before a hurricane and more personal decisions, such as which medical treatment to undergo. Given the widespread use of visualizations and their global impact, it is important that everyone can use visualizations of data effectively. Unfortunately, not all people can understand visualizations of data easily. One-third of the US population exhibits low graph literacy and numeracy, or the underdeveloped ability to work with graphically presented information and numbers. Graph literacy and numeracy are two key factors that contribute to visualization literacy. This work removes barriers for disadvantaged students in STEM by identifying the causes of low visualization literacy, and developing free and equitable resources to improve visualization literacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on determining the nature of the cognitive factors that produce difficulty in reasoning with visualizations. In a recent review paper, Padilla and colleagues proposed a cognitive model for how people make decisions with visualizations (Padilla, Creem-Regehr, Hegarty, &amp; Stefanucci, 2018).  Building on this model, the current project seeks to identify cognitive components that lead to a misunderstanding of visualizations for people with low visualization literacy. These studies contribute new knowledge about how diverse groups of people understand and use data visualizations, in addition to providing practical recommendations for how to help people make their best possible decisions with visualizations of data. The results of this work strengthen our basic understanding of visualization cognition for people that have difficulty understanding STEM graphics. This project also provides educators with empirically tested methods for helping students with low visualization literacy use and understand visualizations of data, thusly removing a barrier to success in STEM for these disadvantaged populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team seeks to develop a model of how individuals make decisions. They propose a framework that could be an alternative to the standard approach of modeling economic preferences. The team wants to replace this standard approach with an alternative that can better explain results from experimental and behavioral economics. They seek to develop an approach that is quite general, so that it can be applied to any economic decision. Their model will replace the simple preference relation (which ranks all alternatives) with a concept they call a preference structure. Preference structures include two relations. The first captures all rankings that the individual finds easy or straightforward. The second relation that comes from observing how the individual makes decisions between two alternatives, whether that decision is easy or hard. The goal is to provide new methods for behavioral economics. If the project provides a more accurate way to model actual decision making that can also be used to predict future decisions, it would be useful in a wide variety of practical contexts in business management and public policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model of preference structures includes two binary relations. The first captures easy rankings. As cyclical choice patterns are unlikely to rise from easy pairwise choice problems, this relation is required to be transitive but not necessarily complete. The second relation is complete but may not be transitive. The two relations are consistent. This model subsumes many preference models, such as those that allow for indecisiveness, imperfect ability of discrimination, regret, and completions based on recommendations. Moreover, there is a natural way of modeling the choice behavior induced by a preference structure by using the notion of top-cycles. This leads to a generalization of standard rational choice theory which meets three goals. It has predictive power, it has appealing existence and uniqueness properties, and it provides ways of empirically eliciting preference structures from choice data. The team plans to explore several avenues, from classical consumer theory to game theory. They also hope to consider decision making under risk and uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently the study of the few remaining populations of hunter-gatherers has high priority for the social,  medical and behavioral sciences. Most research has focused on a few very well-known African groups, notably the Khoisan peoples of southern Africa and the Hadza of Tanzania, who have been conscripted by anthropologists and the popular media as the model for ancestral human society. In the past, hunter-gatherer societies also existed in tropical Asia, but much less is known about them. It is an open question whether Asian rainforest hunter-gatherers differ in significant ways from the savannah-dwelling Africans. The discovery of an isolated tribal population is an unique and exceedingly rare event, and one that is likely to excite public interest in anthropological, biological, and linguistic science. The research team have plans to educate both scientific and non-technical audiences about the population genetics, language, and ethnography about this group, thereby engaging a wider audience in scientific research.

In 2017 the elected leader of the Punan of the eastern region of Indonesian Borneo discovered an unknown,  isolated population of 118 cave-dwelling Punan hunter-gatherers. Concerned about their welfare, the Punan leader requested assistance from a biomedical research team from the Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, including anthropologist Dr. Steve Lansing of the Santa Fe Institute. Specifically, the Punan leader requested that Lansing and one Indonesian researcher accompany him to the cave, to assess the immediate biomedical vulnerabilities of the inhabitants, and ensure that appropriate precautions are taken to safeguard their health and welfare. Lansing and the Indonesian research team will seek the informed consent of the Cave Punan for follow-up visits to conduct comprehensive  studies of their health, demography, languages, material culture and kinship practices, using methods described  in numerous recent publications by Lansing and colleagues.

Are urban surface temperature signatures explained better by such urban classes than by individual land-cover classes?  How is urban structure associated with ecosystem services such as air pollution and noise mitigation?  How do different configurations of urban vegetation help mitigate air and noise pollution in cities such as Philadelphia?

Those fortunate enough to avoid the scrutiny of the justice system never need exercise these rights. Those who do find themselves entangled in the criminal justice system also rarely exercise these rights. Today's accused frequently forgo their right to a trial, and all related rights, by entering a guilty plea. Guilty pleas have been increasing over the last 40 years and now account for over 95% of criminal convictions. The shift away from trials and toward pleas has unquestionably increased judicial efficiency, allowing defendants faster case resolutions. Consequently, it is not the increase in pleas, but the increase in false guilty pleas--cases in which a defendant subsequently proven innocent pleads guilty--that is particularly worrying. The National Registry of Exonerations has reported that guilty pleas were a factor in approximately 15% of wrongful conviction cases, but believes that many more false guilty pleas have never, and will never be discovered. Juvenile defendants are especially vulnerable to pleading guilty falsely. Given the transformation of our criminal justice system to one of pleas, it is of critical importance that we increase our understanding of what factors might lead one to plead guilty, especially when factually innocent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our current understanding of the ""deals"" that lead so many to plead guilty is often tied to the shadow-of-the-trial (SoT) model, which posits that plea outcomes rely solely on the discrepancy in penalties from a plea deal versus a trial conviction, factoring in the probability of conviction at trial. Yet, research has shown that both the actual guilt status and age of the accused can significantly and systematically impact plea outcomes. Thus, the research will be conducted with two broad objectives: 1) testing the predictive validity of the SoT model against an updated model, which incorporates an interactive effect of guilt status and age on plea outcomes; and 2) expanding, testing, and disseminating novel plea-simulation software designed for both research and educational purposes. The research will employ a 2 (innocent or guilty) x 3 (conviction probability: 20%, 50%, or 80%) x 3 (plea penalty/offer: 6 months, 12 months, or 18 months) between-participants design. We will recruit a sample of college students, an adult sample, and a juvenile sample. The results of the proposed research could have important policy implications regarding current plea procedures. If, for instance, significant penalty discrepancies are shown to impact the innocent more than the guilty, it would provide justification for reining in the discounts prosecutors can offer during plea negotiations. Additionally, the simulation software will include an educational extension designed to improve comprehension of the plea process and its consequences among juveniles. Ultimately, the research will contribute significantly to understanding of how cases are now adjudicated in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Mona,,Lynch,lynchm@uci.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,02/01/2019,01/31/2021,133436.00,"Criminal courts that operate under the same formal law and policy often develop their own norms and practices, resulting in very different kinds of justice outcomes depending upon where a case is adjudicated. And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court ""communities"" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peer-review is used to identify quality scientific work and as such is the mechanism by which the scientific community regulates itself.  Science, however, does not take place in a vacuum. The possibility of bias from known characteristics such as gender, name, title, or nationality has led to frequent and recurrent calls that the evaluation of scientific work should follow a double-blind review process (where the identities of both the reviewers and the authors are withheld) rather than a single-blind review process (where the identities of the reviewer are withheld but not the authors). Yet, there are strong arguments for the use of single-blind review, including that it is difficult to truly conceal the identity of the authors and that their identities may serve as a valid cue for the quality of the work. The project will compare the outcomes from single- and double-blind reviews of talks included on the program of a national conference. The experiment will examine how well each review process predicts highly rated talks (accuracy) and whether the reviewers show preferences for author characteristics unrelated to talk quality (bias). The project will provide evidence-based recommendations for review procedures that facilitate an efficient, fair, and impartial review process. The project also will help develop methods to insure underrepresented groups have an equal and fair chance in other fields where peer review plays an important role in the research selection process, such as science, technology, engineering, and math.

The project also will examine the impact of the use of these cues on evaluation accuracy. All abstracts submitted for a paper presentation will be subject to both single- and double-blind review. This will allow a direct comparison of the two review processes controlling for heterogeneity between papers. The accepted talks at the annual conference also will be evaluated for their quality and attendance to determine which of the two review methods better predicts these outcomes. No published study has compared actual outcomes of different review processes. Reviewer ratings will be modeled not only using the characteristics of the submitting author, but also the features of the topics in the submitted abstract, thus allowing for comparison of how different review processes impact the judgment processes of reviewers.

Early language development in turn depends on linguistic interactions with adults. Increasingly, researchers are using daylong audio recordings to study child language development and child-caregiver interactions. Compared to short language samples, daylong recordings capture the full range of experiences a child has over the course of a day. Daylong audio recordings are also being used in applied settings. For example, studies show that by the time they enter First Grade, children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds hear tens of millions more words than children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, perpetuating social inequalities. Multiple large-scale intervention projects targeting low socioeconomic households, including the Thirty Million Words Initiative in Chicago and the Providence Talks program, are using daylong audio recordings to provide automated, personalized feedback to parents on when and how often their child hears adult words and experiences conversational turns. The features of daylong recordings that are advantageous for researchers and practitioners also pose unique challenges. For one, their long durations are ideal for studying the temporal dynamics of child-adult interaction, but taking advantage of the long durations requires the enlistment of automated speech recognition technology. Current automatic speech recognition systems have difficulties with child speech and are challenged by the noisy and varied acoustic environments represented in the recordings. Another challenge is that the recordings capture private moments that require long hours of human listening to remove. This makes it difficult for researchers to share the recordings publicly, so that the potential value of the recordings collected by individual research labs is not fully realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create a new resource, called HomeBank, that will have three key components: (1) a public dataset containing daylong audio recordings that have had private information removed by human listeners, (2) a larger dataset containing about ten to one hundred times as many hours of recording that have not had private information removed and will be free but restricted to those who have demonstrated training in human research ethics, and (3) an open-source repository of computer programs to automatically analyze the daylong audio recordings. HomeBank will take advantage of an existing cyberinfrastructure for sharing linguistic data called TalkBank. The daylong audio recordings included in the datasets will represent both typically developing and clinical groups, a range of ages from newborn infants to school age children, and a range of language and socioeconomic backgrounds. We expect the primary users to be basic and applied child development researchers as well as engineers developing automatic speech recognition technologies. The free-to-access database and the open source computer programs will ultimately improve both the data on which early interventions are based and the tools available for providing parents with feedback on the linguistic input they provide their children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This RAPID award supports the collection of critical but ephemeral data where the largest figurine workshop ever encountered in the Maya world has been just recently unearthed.  This is an important discovery that is worthy of scientific study for several reasons.  Academically, this is a little-understood region in spite of its importance to the Mexican and Central American economy as the source of the lion's share of vibrant green quetzal feathers that were used by Maya, Aztec, and other Mesoamerican rulers. Ethically, the owners want to preserve this find and support scientific advances. This emergency RAPID project will provide a solid framework upon which to test the extent to which trade routes and trends observed by the Spaniards were present before the Classic Maya collapse and provide for a detailed model for Classic Maya figurine production and exchange, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of archaeological findings related to regional trade and development. The project improves scientific infrastructure through international scientific collaboration. Research data and findings will further be disseminated through a variety of means to improve scientific and technological understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In May 2018, heavy machinery on the outskirts of the city of Coban, Guatemala cut into a large earthen mound, revealing hundreds of Classic Maya figurine molds, figurines, and incense burners.  The contractor stopped construction immediately and contacted local authorities, who in turn brought in Dr. Brent Woodfill to assess the site's importance.  Dr. Woodfill and his team will investigate the techniques for figurine production, which can be tested against previous models based on limited archaeological data.  By studying this workshop in a largely undisturbed state, they will be able to relate figurine production and exchange to other economic activities that occurred here, and the relationships the producers maintained with local and far-flung Mesoamerican groups.  There has never been a formal archaeological project in this important region, so much of our understanding is based on limited Spanish writings about the local Maya after the Spanish conquest.  By examining the figurines and other archaeological materials, we can test the degree of cultural continuity before and after the drastic changes caused by the Classic collapse and the arrival of Europeans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This limited efficacy of robotic training is possibly due to unnatural human-machine interactions experienced when patients use the device. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project investigates robot-assisted motor learning in people with and without brain lesions. The aim is to improve effective gait rehabilitation after stroke by determining how to maximize generalization of learning from trained to untrained conditions. The PI will also use the research objectives in this project as a means to increase the participation of students from underrepresented minorities (URM) in science and engineering. Specifically, the PI will recruit, mentor, and prepare URM students from K-12 and college to pursue advanced education, with the ultimate goal of broadening the professional opportunities for URM students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split-belt walking, during which the legs move at different speeds, has been shown to induce locomotor learning in post-stroke patients and subjects without neurological damage. Here the PI will determine if the learning phase on the split-belt treadmill in these two populations can be altered to enhance the generalization of learned movements from the treadmill to natural walking. The research uses a human-in-the-loop method that manipulates a subject's perceived gait symmetry to create the illusion of error-free performance during split-belt walking. Through this closed-loop approach, the PI aims to identify ways to enhance the generalization of movements learned on the treadmill to non-treadmill conditions.

Many assessment tests and surveys given by researchers in the social and behavioral sciences are perceived as low stakes by participants, yet researchers rely heavily on such data to address their research questions. Data from low-stakes assessments may contain a substantial portion of inattentive responses, driven by carelessness or fatigue from participants, or sometimes from malicious attempts by survey-bots. The increasing popularity of online platforms for participant recruitment and data collection further exacerbates the problem. The investigators will develop statistical methods to detect inattentive responses. They will benchmark the performance of these methods and identify the best method for different types of inattentiveness.

Meanwhile, nearly half of the world's 7,000 languages are under threat of disappearance, presenting linguistics with the urgent challenge of documenting under-studied languages while communities still use them. This dissertation project addresses these issues not only by documenting an under-studied, segmentally-rich language, but through groundbreaking adaptation of experimental methods to a fieldwork setting to provide rich, quantitative data of the type normally only available for well-studied languages. The researchers will conduct the first quantitatively-driven investigations of the sound system and grammar of Tsova-Tush, a critically endangered Northeast Caucasian language spoken in Georgia. This language family and region are both dramatically underrepresented in linguistics, meaning that quantitative data from this language are particularly valuable for helping to increase the diversity of the database available to linguistic science. Further, its location in Georgia is an ideal fieldwork setting for adapting experimental methods for an endangered language: Tsova-Tush is spoken in a rural, agricultural village with many of the challenges of other fieldwork sites, but with reliable enough access to transit and telecommunications to make the application and troubleshooting of experimental methods feasible. Finally, the documentation will provide valuable data about a segmentally complex language that will further our understanding of the cognitive demands of human language complexity in general. Broader impacts include a public repository of recordings and transcriptions, the training of a doctoral student, and facilitating access to linguistic resources for a minority language group to enhance scientific understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative studies in the dissertation focus on three linguistic questions: the status of long vowels and consonants, the grammaticality of demonstratives and pronouns (indexicals), and the readability of a proposed writing system. It has been suggested that Tsova-Tush has both plain and ""intensive"" consonants, as well as short, long, and ""hyperlong"" vowels, but linguists lack the phonetic details to establish the exact properties of this complicated sound system. Through a detailed acoustic study with multiple speakers, this project will describe the durational properties that distinguish these consonants and vowels. Further, Tsova-Tush has a complex system of indexicals, distinguishing three deictic distances ('here'/'there'/'over there'), whose grammatical uses are poorly understood. In this project, an experiment will be conducted, in which speakers will be asked to judge the grammaticality of sentences with indexicals in a wide variety of contexts, thus establishing the parameters of indexical shift. Finally, based on the findings of these studies, the researchers will test the readability of a proposed Tsova-Tush writing system and provide speakers with linguistically sound recommendations for developing written materials in the language. The dissertation's description of the successes and challenges of the quantitative studies in a documentation scenario will help improve the methodologies of both documentary and experimental linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reading comprehension difficulties and concomitant lack of access to printed ideas and information is a problem for a wide range of populations of children with poor reading skills (e.g. poor urban and rural children, children with dyslexia, and deaf children.)  Research discoveries in each of these populations have advanced our understanding of the diversity of reading development and supported the development of optimal instructional strategies for various types of young readers. Deaf children's reading abilities vary, but on average have remained far behind those of their hearing peers despite advancements in hearing technologies (e.g., hearing aids and cochlear implants) and decades of various approaches to providing visible access to spoken language (e.g., speechreading, Cued Speech, Signed Exact English). By examining successful deaf readers, researchers have repeatedly found examined strong correlations between sign language proficiency and reading outcomes. Unfortunately, it has remained unclear exactly what aspects of sign language proficiency contribute to reading outcomes in deaf children. One important predictor of reading abilities in hearing children is phonological awareness (PA), the ability to identify and manipulate the phonological structure of words, and recent behavioral research has found that PA for signed languages is related to deaf children's reading, but whether signed and spoken language PA are the product of a common cognitive mechanism remains unclear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the brain basis of PA for American Sign Language (ASL) and English and address two hypotheses of phonological awareness and reading development in deaf children. The spoken language phonology dependent hypothesis holds that spoken language phonology is essential for reading, and that phonological processing in deaf children is delayed rather than abnormal. Abstract phonological representations are assembled from the accessible auditory signal and visual articulatory cues (i.e., mouth movements) that can be strengthened over time. Though delayed, the phonological representations are the basis for phonological awareness and reading in deaf children. According to the modality independent hypothesis, abstract phonological representations are not tied to speech, but are amodal. When children have early, natural exposure to language, regardless of modality, they develop strong phonological representations which give rise to PA skills for segmenting and manipulating phonological information that can be applied to learning to read.  To test these hypotheses, we will recruit deaf children who use ASL and hearing monolingual English speakers enrolled in grades K - 6. All children will be administered standardized reading comprehension and nonverbal IQ assessments. While undergoing functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging, we will assess the brain bases of ASL and English PA using a non-orthographic, non-linguistic picture-matching paradigm. Analyses will investigate the relationships between brain regions activated for PA in both modalities and reading comprehension.

The primary goal of this research is to focus on fiduciary duties -- regulations designed to ensure that agents act in their clients' best interest -- imposed on various agents in the retirement system. This research aims at (1) providing empirical evidence on the effects of the efficacy of these regulations and (2) studying the effects of alternate regulatory proposals on the structure of the retirement market. The investigators first study the market of financial advice. The United States is in the middle of a protracted debate over the merits of imposing fiduciary duty on broker-dealers selling retirement products, which partially involves trading off the potential for aligning incentives of the clients with those of the adviser with the costs of an excessive regulatory burden. The investigators also study the market of employer-provided defined contribution plans, like 401(k) plans, when plan managers for certain plans are subject to fiduciary duties imposed through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  This research studies how employer-trustee bargaining can influence the fees and plan offerings and examines regulations to restrict either fees or plan offerings, which can have important distributional consequences for a market in which investment options and costs are directly tied to one's place of employment. The investigators bring previously unexplored data to these questions and develop new methods for studying choices in the presence of multiple decision makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has three prongs.  First, the investigators leverage a transactions-level dataset from a major financial services provider to study the effects of fiduciary duty on product choice.  This research utilizes a differences-in-differences approach, comparing across states that impose differential fiduciary duties on broker-dealers and using investment advisers regulated at the federal level as a control. The investigators then supplement this reduced-form analysis with a model of selective entry into the market for financial advice.  Second, this project develops a structural model of discrete choice in which choices are determined not just by consumer utility but also by (possibly biased) advice.  Estimates from this model will help decompose the mechanisms through which fiduciary duty operates and also provide guidance on alternate reforms; it will also provide a framework for analyzing advice in other markets.  Finally, the investigators use data on the fee structure and plan offerings of the universe of ERISA-compliant defined contribution plans to develop a model of bargaining between employers and plan providers to quantify the level to which various parties internalize plan costs.  The model also allows for studying the effect of imposing most-favored-nation clauses on fees or plan offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All societies have leaders but the forms, functions, and effects of leadership vary from society to society. For the vast majority of human evolutionary history, people lived as hunter-gatherers in small nomadic bands and had social structures likely characterized by high degrees of egalitarianism, a lack of inherited social distinctions, and a cultural ethos of sharing. Leadership under these conditions would be quite different from leadership in contemporary societies, which are larger and less homogeneous. Therefore, to understand the origins and development of leadership, the roots of contemporary leadership forms, it is necessary to collect data in the few small-scale societies that remain. The research is important because leadership is a major force in shaping human behavior, health, culture, and society. A complete understanding of human leadership begins with a detailed understanding of leadership in small-scale egalitarian societies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Washington State University doctoral student, Zachary Garfield, with oversight by Dr. Edward H. Hagen. The researchers will test four evolutionary theories of leadership among the Chabu, a population of approximately 2,000 recently settled Ethiopian hunter-gatherers who now subsist on a mix of hunting, gathering, horticulture, and cash crops. The Chabu recently adopted the Kebele system, a local administrative unit of the Ethiopian government in which the community elects multiple leaders to fulfill several internal and external functions. Hence, there is a unique opportunity to investigate leadership among a contemporary egalitarian society currently transitioning to a more hierarchical social structure within the male-dominated Ethiopian state. The four theoretical models of leadership to be investigated are (1) the egalitarian forager model, (2) the dominance-prestige model, (3) the wealth inequality model, and (4) collective action models of leadership. Data will be collected using self-report, peer-ratings, anthropometry, and free-listing for a sample of approximately 250 individuals. These data will be used to test preregistered predictions and other analyses.

Amid a new sense of urgency regarding environmental change and food production, policymakers are deciding how to allocate development aid to improve food systems under the banner of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). CSA aims to be an experimental and data-driven approach, with a focus on introducing new technologies, improved and transgenic seeds and novel farming techniques among small-scale farmers to mitigate the effects of rapid environmental change more efficiently. The United States is an early adopter of the climate-smart concept since 2010 but has only recently started to direct official development aid toward expressly climate-smart agricultural (CSA) programs elsewhere, in conjunction with international organizations, philanthropic foundations, and multinational corporate partners. To date, the technological and relational content of climate-smart agriculture in practice has received little in-depth scholarly investigation. Both academics and practitioners of development puzzle over what climate resilience actually entails and how its success can be achieved and measured. This study, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirical data collection and analysis, explores the relationship between climate-smart agriculture and practices related to food security.

Mozambique is an appropriate site for assessing climate-smart agriculture in practice. The high volume of development aid invested historically and currently, especially in the area of sustainable development, makes it an ideal laboratory for evaluating climate-smart agriculture longitudinally. Climate-smart commitments take place via bilateral aid partnerships with traditional donors such as the United States, as well as emerging donors like Brazil, and private corporations. Using ethnographic methods of participant-observation and interviews with farmer beneficiaries and development practitioners, the researchers will examine how development discourse, technology transfer and farming practice is reconfigured when agricultural aid is mobilized around the climate-smart paradigm. Of particular interest are the ways that women farmers respond to these initiatives, and the local perceptions and lived experiences of environmental change, land rights and food security that emerge in the context of these interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At 3.0 Ma, multiple species of Australopithecus are represented in the fossil record across eastern and southern Africa. By 2.5 Ma, Australopithecus mostly died out, and in its place evolved two separate lineages with very different adaptations to the environment. One lineage is our own, Homo, characterized by a pattern of increased brain size and dependence on material culture that has persisted over the last several million years. The other lineage, Paranthropus, lasted over 1 million years, and was represented by three species with unique dental and facial adaptations for potentially eating tough or hard foods. Despite the obvious importance of this interval, it is poorly represented in the fossil record and few fossil specimens have been found that can shed light on the causes and patterns of the origins of these lineages. The Ledi-Geraru Research Project works in a fossiliferous region that includes this important time interval and aims to illuminate the issues relevant to the extinction of Australopithecus and the emergence of Homo and Paranthropus. The investigators will use the results of this work in public science outreach about the hominin lineage, including the critical relationship between environmental variance and hominin adaptations. The project also will foster international collaborations and student training. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the last decade, the investigators have identified fossiliferous sediments in the Afar region of Ethiopia that range from 2.9 to 2.4 Ma before present. Finds from these sediments include a 2.8 million year old mandible that is the earliest known representative of the genus Homo, and additional fossils suggesting that there were multiple hominin species existing at roughly the same time in the region. In addition, several localities in the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area show evidence that hominins were using stone tools to gain access to animal tissues and resources. Continued paleoanthropological research will be conducted at Ledi-Geraru Project sites to recover additional fossil and archaeological materials and better understand relationships between hominin behaviors and environmental contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Workshop will provide a forum for scholars and practitioners to discuss strategies that would advance a more theoretically robust and methodologically rigorous environmental sociology that seeks to overcome institutional and disciplinary obstacles to advancing the study of race and the environment in sociology and in the sub-discipline of environmental sociology.  This Workshop will bring together U.S.-based scholars to share work that draws on theoretical frameworks that are outside of the traditional purview of environmental sociology to address the lack of diversity in scholarship in the sub-discipline. This Workshop aligns well with the core value of inclusiveness and the strategic goal of innovative interdisciplinary collaboration outlined in the NSF Strategic Plan for 2014-2018. Both initiatives strive to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific inquiry. <br/><br/><br/>Over the past four decades, membership in the Environmental Sociology (ES) section of the American Sociological Association (ASA) has steadily grown to reach 510 members in 2017, which is slightly higher than the section average of 505 for all 52 ASA sections.  However, the percentage of African American, Hispanic/Latino(a), and Asian/Asian American scholars in the ES section is very low in comparison to other ASA sections and the association overall. Just under 5% of section members identified as Asian/Asian American in 2005 and 2016, and around 2.5% as Hispanic/Latino(a) in 2005 and 2016. Regular ES members who identify as African American increased from zero members in 2005 to seven in 2016, and now represent 2.5% of section membership. The proposal argues that the lack of diversity in ES and in the subfield of environmental sociology is a result of lack of engagement with other disciplinary fields. The one-day workshop will increase the range of theoretical and methodological discussion in the subfield, thus encouraging greater diversity in both scientific approaches as well as in the demographics of participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While households are free to migrate away from declining areas, towards prospering ones, many reasons mitigate mobility, leaving residents exposed to local economic conditions. This CAREER agenda proposes a line of projects to examine the causes and consequences of limited mobility, how it varies across the income levels, and ultimately contributes to well-being or inequality. The first line of research will focus on the consumption patterns across US cities and income levels. The second line will investigate the benefits of living nearby one's family members. The third line of work will look at the consequences of financial instability and housing foreclosure on homeowners, renters, and landlords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate the geography of consumption inequality, the investigator will use a new dataset of linked bank account and credit card micro data covering 5 percent of the US. This analysis will shed light on whether consumption bundles vary mostly based on one's income or whether one's place of residence influences one's consumption bundle. The second line of work will shed light on why low skill workers appear less willing to migrate between cities. A likely mechanism contributing to limited migration is low skill workers' desire to live near their families. While geographic proximity to one's family may be beneficial in many ways, the research will investigate its labor market value using administrative data. The third line of work will analyze the costs and consequences of losing access to one's home and neighborhood through foreclosure. The project will separately study impacts on homeowner occupants, renters, and landlords to decompose the financial versus eviction effects of foreclosure. Heterogeneity in the impacts of foreclosure across high and low-income neighborhoods will provide additional evidence on whether foreclosure is a regressive or progressive policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of Latin American countries share some of the feature present in Honduras: multiparty systems, low institutionalization of political parties, weak programmatic links between parties and voters, which makes the vote choices very volatile and hence the information available at the time of the election has a prominent role. This is all against a backdrop of eroded confidence in the electoral system, which is to a certain extent shared across the region. Deepening the understanding of the electoral process through individual-level data is key to better understand voter behavior and how this impacts and shapes representation, influences parties? decisions and legislative outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideological identification, candidate issue position and party identification (Campbell et al 1960) can help voters make their voting choice. However, when voters have to choose among parties and candidates within them (i.e. open list systems with panachage), party ideology or issue position may not provide enough information to the voter. In this context, some voters may rely on information cues such as name recognition, incumbency, gender and race among others, while others will simply deploy satisficing strategies to deal with voter fatigue phenomena. In addition to this, ballots may not be presenting all alternatives equally or may demand a different amount of resources for the choices available. Or some candidates can be favored given their placement in the ballot, or by physical attributes visible thought the picture in the ballot. Although it is reasonable to assume all these factors can affect voter behavior, we know very little about voters? decision under these set of rules. In this project we use a stratified sample of actual votes cast randomly selected out of the more than 18.103 ballot boxes across the Honduras, where six million Hondurans were registered to vote. Analyzing actual votes cast in open list systems may provide the means to deepening our understanding of the electoral process and how voters use the provisions offered by the electoral rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, second language learning is a complex and challenging endeavor that results in a great deal of variability in learning outcomes. Some learners reach acceptable levels of proficiency for their purposes whereas other learners do not. Nonetheless, the factors that explain the varying levels of success in adult second language learning are still not fully understood. One way in which researchers work to explain who is expected to be successful when learning a second language is to identify the set of individual factors that are associated with successful adult second language learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project investigates two cognitive factors that have been shown to play a role in bilingualism and that have also recently been proposed to contribute to second language learning. The first factor, inhibitory control, is defined as an individual's ability to deliberately suppress automatic responses and has been shown to be key for bilingual language control. The second factor, language flexibility, refers to an individual's ability to tolerate changes to their first language and is evident in bilingual language processing. The dissertation will examine the role of these factors in second language learners as they become bilingual. To do so, we will first assess second language proficiency with multiple measures in adult learners of Spanish who are at early, intermediate, or late stages of learning the language. Second, behavioral measures will be taken of learners' inhibitory control ability, and brain-based, electrophysiological measures will assess language flexibility by examining the extent to which their developing Spanish affects their first language processing. Finally, these sets of data will be analyzed to examine to what extent inhibitory control abilities and language flexibility predict the level of proficiency that the learners achieve. The findings from the study are expected to have broad implications for theory and practice. The research will inform our theoretical understanding of the underlying cognitive and brain mechanisms that contribute to the complex task of learning a second language. This increased understanding about how languages are learned, in turn, will inform methodological approaches for teaching second languages. For example, instructional materials can be designed that leverage or support individual learner characteristics such as their inhibitory control ability. This project will also provide invaluable hands-on experience to graduate and undergraduate research assistants in areas including research design, data analyses of cognitive and brain-based, electrophysiological data, and data interpretation. Finally, given that the institution where this research will take place has a diverse student population, it will involve students from groups who are often underrepresented in higher education, many of whom are second language learners themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By uncovering the determinants of vote choice and political participation in the 2020 presidential election, the 2020 ANES will yield high-quality data focusing on questions that go to the heart of democratic governance including citizens' satisfaction with their government and their ability to hold political leaders accountable. While the 2020 study continues the tradition of a fresh cross-section sample, it also includes two panel components that allow researchers to examine changes in American public opinion over an especially turbulent period of national politics.  Re-interviews with 2016 ANES respondents will shed light on long-term changes in attitudes following the election of President Trump. Re-interviews with a sub-sample of respondents who completed the General Social Survey in the spring of 2020 will illuminate more short-term shifts in beliefs and opinions over the course of the 2020 campaign. Overall, the ANES 2020 study provides researchers with strong leverage over the dynamics of voter decision making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2020 study will continue to serve as a benchmark for research on American public opinion. The study will survey at least 3,500 Americans, recruited by mail to complete questionnaires online.

These datasets will permit groundbreaking research on many important questions that would not be possible with a single cross-sectional study, providing unique opportunities to map continuity and change in American politics. The 2020 study also extends recent and ongoing ANES efforts to reshape the trajectory of large-scale survey research with high-quality mail-to-web data collection, and features the first-ever collaboration between ANES and GSS. Sub-samples of around 500 Latinos and 500 African-Americans will exceed previous ANES studies and allow researchers to investigate the role of race in reshaping major party coalitions and as a force that propels voters to the polls.

Comparative archaeological analyses of complex societies have demonstrated that there is a high degree of variability in the expression of such complexity, as well as in the processes that led to its emergence around the world. Within this broader context, this study focuses on household economy in order to gain insight about the sources of political and economic power, and reveal other forms of organization that may differ from top-down norms. The results will inform about social and political complexity, domestic and community economy, and occupational differentiation. This project represents an opportunity to collaborate with Costa Rican heritage authorities and the National Parks system to promote public outreach, education, and conservation of cultural heritage. Student participants will receive mentorship, training, and experience in archaeological theories and field and laboratory methods. The project will integrate Latina women as field supervisors and crew in order to broaden their participation as an underrepresented group in science.

During AD 800-1500, the appearance of monumental centers in Costa Rica indicates a reorganization of social, political and economic relationships. Such changes coincide with an amplification of interregional exchange and chiefly interaction for Central Costa Rican polities. These large-scale developments are best measured by their impacts in all levels of society, but especially by their impact on the smallest and remote residential units. This study will evaluate previously held assumptions about the relationship between elite power and control of resources and valuable objects by studying household economic differentiation, activity organization, and access to exchange networks at Lomas Entierros site. The researchers will analyze domestic assemblages in combination with house architecture in order to characterize manifestations of wealth, power, and material culture usage. Data from house structures located in the main core of the site and humbler edifices on its periphery will provide contrastive examples from higher and lower social status contexts.

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Objects move, information changes, and human observers need to keep updating their representations of that world in order to continue to function effectively. It is obvious that humans lack the capacity to monitor everything continuously but what is the limit? In classic experiments where people have to track subsets of items as they move around a screen, they seem to be able track 3-4 if all items in the display are identical, and just 2-3 if the items are distinct and they also have to track the identities of the items. However, these numbers seem artificially low, and our personal experience is that our visual awareness is much larger. The key reason seems to be that traditional experimental designs do not account for partial knowledge of items' identity and location. We developed the Multiple Object Awareness (MOA) task to measure this partial knowledge. When we include partial knowledge, it turns out that you know something about 8-12 items, not just 2-4. Why do we care? Many real-world tasks involve being able to rapidly find and interact with multiple items in a changing world. Think of a commander, trying to keep track of his squad and his enemies while monitoring the rest of the action around him or first responders, handling an evolving accident scene. Understanding MOA capacity can impact the design of workplaces (e.g. aircraft cockpits). Moreover, training may improve MOA capacity. If this proves to be the case, then MOA could provide a path to improvement on tasks from monitoring multiple streams of information in an operating room to keeping any eye on your 3rd grade class.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The basic MOA tasks, used in this project, are modifications of the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Multiple Identity Tracking (MIT) tasks. Observers monitor a set of moving objects (cartoon animals in our pilot work). The observers are asked to keep track of all of the objects as best they can. Every so often, we cover all items with disks and ask about the location of a specific animal. The crucial innovation is that we ask observers to keep clicking on disks until they find the target animal. As an observer, if you are guessing, you need to click on half the items on average. If you have some idea about the target location, you will need fewer clicks. Based on the number of clicks required, it is possible to derive a MOA capacity estimate of 8-12 items, far greater than MOT or MIT.  Our specific plans are: (1) To screen a large population in order to test the hypothesis that MOA will show a wider natural range of variation than MOT or working memory, (2) to test the hypothesis that MOA is trainable in ways that MOT and working memory are not, and (3) to study MOA in more complex, realistic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems participated in co-funding of the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researcher has chosen northeastern Congo as a site to investigate this problem because local and international actors there have expanded an old radio network to create a new Early Warning Network to connect communities who have no other communication infrastructure. The fact that this is the only communication infrastructure in the research site will make it easier to isolate the effects of the communication system than would be the case in a situation, such as the United States, where multiple systems are present. The overarching research questions are: (1) Does using an old technology reinforce certain conceptions of insecurity and discount others? (2) Does localizing a security apparatus reconfigure how people understand their relationship to authority? (3) How do the limits and history of the technology itself affect its contemporary use? The researcher will collect data using a mixture of ethnographic and archival research methods, including participant observation, interviews, network analysis, and historical documentation.

Jennifer,A,Raff,jennifer.raff@ku.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,03/01/2019,08/31/2024,450000.00,"In recent years, ancient DNA research has transformed our understanding of human history. In the Americas, ancient genomes have revealed new and surprising details, such as the presence of previously unknown populations, previously unsuspected relationships between groups, and new estimates of dates for past events in human history.  Although recent studies have investigated the origins and history of different Native American groups, few have focused on the indigenous peoples of the Aleutian Islands, a population that may prove central to our understanding of human dispersals in the western hemisphere. The analysis of genomes from ancient and contemporary Aleuts will allow us to better understand the origins of these peoples, how they adapted to a challenging environment, and how European contact and recent population events have affected their genetic diversity. This research is supported by Aleut political and cultural leaders, who are interested in using genetic approaches to better understand their people's history. Results from this project will be used in education materials for the participating communities, as well as in initiatives designed to train Native American students in genetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Americas were the last continents to become inhabited by humans, but it has recently become clear that the history of this process was far more complicated than originally understood based on archaeology alone. For example, current archaeological evidence suggests that the Aleutian Islands were peopled approximately 9,000 years ago in a series of population movements from the Alaska Peninsula westward, with groups inhabiting the western islands by about 3,000 years ago. A recently published analysis of genomic-scale data from ancient and contemporary peoples of the Arctic, which includes data from a few ancient individuals from the Eastern Aleutian islands, indicates that the Aleutian gene pool dates to approximately 5,000 years ago, leaving a 4,000 year discrepancy between archaeological and genetic records. One hypothesis to resolve the discrepancy between the genetic and archaeological dates holds that the earliest ancestors of Native Americans - who lived in Beringia approximately 20,000 years ago - may have moved southward to the Alaska Peninsula, eventually peopling the present-day central and western islands. The investigators will test this hypothesis and uncover additional details of the history of the peopling of the Aleutian Islands through the analysis of complete genomes from ancient and contemporary Aleuts. They will also assess the demographic effects of European contact beginning in the 18th century on Aleut populations, and characterize the genetic adaptations of ancient and contemporary Aleuts to the challenging environmental conditions present in the archipelago over time. This research was developed in a partnership between Aleut political and cultural leadership and the researchers at the University of Kansas, which is the result of a decades-long collaboration. This project is jointly funded by the Biological Anthropology Programs, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Arctic Social Science Program at the National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Rachel,,Wu,rachel.wu@ucr.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2019,08/31/2024,739002.00,"Learning to adapt to a changing environment, especially due to technological advances, is important, yet understudied. Learning to adapt is especially important for older adults, as it allows them to maintain functional independence (i.e., live independently). For example, as healthcare providers move towards only accessing patients' medical records online, learning to use new online portals would allow an older adult to avoid needing someone else to access personal medical records. The proposed studies with older adults leverage learning theories from infant and child development, when cognitive growth is typical, in contrast to older adulthood, when cognitive growth is thought to be limited. The proposed research tests whether providing older adults with an informative, rich, and encouraging learning environment leads to learning what to learn, and how to learn in new situations (i.e., transfer of learning). This transfer of learning is hypothesized to trigger a cascading effect of new skill learning in daily life to increase cognitive abilities and maintain functional independence.  The broader impacts of the research are twofold. First, this project addresses an urgent need for learning research in older adulthood. According to the US Census Bureau, by 2035 there will be more older adults over age 65 than children under 18 in the US. Most research-based recommendations to maintain cognitive abilities and functional independence primarily include activities that do not prioritize learning explicitly (e.g., physical exercise, healthy diet), despite the need to adapt to a constantly changing environment. The findings from this project could lead to more effective interventions for cognitive and functional gains in adulthood. Second, research-education activities will be undertaken to educate the general public on aging research. In addition to public writing, talks, and video tutorials on aging research, a public symposium will bring together researchers and service providers to enhance communication of research and its application. Mentored research opportunities for older adults, undergraduates, and graduate students, including low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students at UC Riverside, a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution will be made encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research specifically tests the role of frequent and varied (vs. frequent or varied) skill learning in older adults. Research with infants, children, and young adults suggest that frequency and variability may have both unique and combined contributions on learning. In a 12-week pilot intervention, older adults, who engaged in frequent and varied skill learning, similar to an undergraduate course load, increased their cognitive abilities (working memory, cognitive control) to levels similar to those of middle-aged adults, 30 years younger. A no-contact control group exhibited no gains. The proposed research includes a 2-year longitudinal study comparing 12-week frequent AND varied versus frequent OR varied skill learning conditions with follow-up assessments. Analyses will (1) compare the immediate and long-term impact of cognitive abilities, motivation, and learning activities on functional independence and (2) evaluate individual differences in pre-test cognitive abilities and motivation on intervention outcomes. The research-education efforts will open communication channels between older adult communities and researchers and create research opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and older adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the models archaeologists typically employ are strongly conditioned by a limited number of historical and ethnographic cases that are inextricably linked to modern states.  Archaeologists are now recognizing great organizational variability among ancient complex societies, and in the pathways by which societies become complex. This project will investigate the varied roles that secondary centers play within the development of complex, non-state systems, highlighting organizational postures not documented in the ethnographic or historical present.  This research will contribute directly to the theoretical understanding of emergent social complexity and the alternate pathways this development may take.

The researchers will conduct a program of excavation and analysis at this secondary center to investigate its position within the Middle Bronze Age Maros (Mori) Group.  The project will test alternative hypotheses concerning the potential roles Anka Siget may have played within the Maros polity.  Activities and developments at Rabe with be compared with those recently documented by the researchers' NSF funded project at Pecica ""Anul Mare"" (Romania), the primary center of the polity.  Additional lines of evidence will evaluate the strength and nature of the connections between Anka Siget and Pecica, with other Maros settlements, and with the wider set of peer polities in the Carpathian Basin.  This project will be the first community-scale excavation of a Maros tell.  The use of multi-tiered geophysical survey methods, combined with targeted excavations, will produce an unprecedented view of the internal organization of a Bronze Age settlement.  Through this work, the investigators will not only elucidate the development of a pivotal Bronze Age polity, but also will contribute to the wider anthropological debate surrounding emergent social complexity by providing an alternative case of organization within a pre-state polity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Music forms an important part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and it is one of the few universals shared by all known human cultures. Yet its utility and potential evolutionary advantages remain a mystery. This project will test the hypothesis that early musical exposure has benefits that extend beyond music to critical aspects of human communication, such as speech perception in noise. In addition, the investigators will test whether early musical training is associated with less severe effects of aging on the ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. Degraded ability to understand speech in noise is a common complaint among older listeners and hearing loss has been shown to be associated with social isolation and more rapid cognitive and health declines. If formal musical training is shown to affect improved perception and speech communication in later life, the outcomes could have a potentially major impact on quality of life,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier studies have suggested relationships between early musical training and improved auditory neural processing and perception, but the studies' impact has been limited by small sample numbers and inconsistent methods between different studies. This project will test a large number of participants (N=360) with uniform recruitment criteria and testing protocols across six different sites. Measures will include the neural frequency following response (FFR) to speech sounds, behavioral frequency selectivity, speech perception in noise, speech perception against a background of competing talkers, pitch discrimination, and auditory masking. The participants will also complete other assessments, including a personality inventory questionnaire, a profile of musical perception skills, a spatial reasoning test to assess general cognitive ability, as well as a background questionnaire to determine socio-economic status, education, and musical background. Participants will be selected to span a wide range of ages and musical experience. The neural data and the speech perception measures will be related to factors of musical training, such as the number of years of musical training and the age at which musical training began.

Archaeological investigation allows scholars to generate relevant insights about processes of social inequality and political centralization over extended periods of time in human history, which include the emergence of sedentary communities, the development of larger polities, and their disintegrations. Previous scholarship has found that migration can be important during the process of political centralization, where on some occasions non-local individuals are drawn to big centers as the power and influence of those cities increased. Scholars are interested in examining the role that these migrations had during the development of social inequalities and political growth. Diet can play an important role for studying political centralization and social inequality because it not only provides us information about health, but also social class, ethnic groups, and lifestyle affiliations. By studying ancient populations, places of origin and cultural landscapes, the researchers can begin identifying and differentiating ethnic groups, social class, lifestyles, dietary practices, and other social complexities of human culture. The results of the proposed research will contribute to the study of migration, diet, social inequalities, political centralization, as well as to that of the emergence and decline of centralized polities not only in Mesoamerica but also in other parts of the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Palomo will examine social inequality and political centralization processes at critical moments of the human history, which include the emergence of sedentary communities, the development of larger polities, and their disintegrations. To address these issues, the scholars are examining two more specific questions: 1) How were social inequality and political centralization reflected in dietary practices? 2) How were changes in social inequality and political centralization associated with those in-migrations and external relations? To examine these questions, the research team will conduct a multi-isotopic analysis on the skeletal remains of 86 sampled individuals from the Mayan archaeological site of Ceibal that date from the Middle Preclassic to the Terminal Classic periods. During the analysis, the researchers will create and promote education and training opportunities for students. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic data will allow the scholars to examine whether changes in social inequality and political centralization were accompanied by those in the diet. Oxygen, strontium, and lead isotopic analysis will be used to examine whether Ceibal attracted more migrants and whether there were more hostile external relations during the periods of growing political centralization or during the establishment of political regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spoken language use reflects many factors, including cognitive constraints on production and perception of sound, speech community membership, and cultural practices, among others. This study models the interrelationships between these factors and participation in regional sound changes or resistance to change, bilectal use of mainstream English together with a heritage language variety used in the local speech community, or monolectal use of an ethnic variety of English. The study site is Washington state. Unlike many places in the United States where ethnic groups settled into small communities with relatively insular social networks (resulting in the famous ethnic enclaves of the East coast and Inland North), the Pacific Northwest has long been characterized by regional and social mobility. The notion of ""community"" itself is complex, but requires better understanding as non-white, mobile individuals become a larger part of the US population. This study also uses practice-based, rather than assignment-based methods for determining ethnic group membership. General practice in the language sciences in North America has been to sample primarily from majority-ethnicity groups in a speech community. The assumption taken has been that non-white speakers do not participate in regional sound changes, but are embedded in separate speech communities defined by shared ethnic identity. While partly true, this assumption has been shown to be a vast oversimplification. There is scholarship showing that speakers' use of ethnolectal forms is not predicted by race as much as by social network composition. But complex social models need to be better-integrated into linguistic research. Race has been conflated with ethnicity, for one thing. Race (physical appearance or genetic heritage), rather than ethnicity (cultural heritage, practice, and perceived affiliation) has been used as an initial tool for constructing research samples, leading to a priori determinations about speech community membership.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes social network measures of localness of affective network, homophily (similarity-based affiliation), network range, and referential network.  Linguistic data are drawn from vowel system recordings and measures of the acoustic cues to phonetic production, focusing on sets of features known to be associated with mainstream as well as local dialects. Spoken data provide the stimuli for cross-dialect testing of listener sensitivity to fine-grained, time-varying differences in sound. The result is a model of participation in linguistic change relevant for mobile, non-white Pacific Northwest speakers, contributing to sociolinguistic theorization of dialect evolution and interethnic contact, as well as listeners' use of social information in the perception of phonetic variation.  The study involves collaboration between researchers at the University of Washington, and Heritage University, located on Yakama First Nation lands in Toppenish, Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Markets are increasingly saturated with very detailed and precise information, such as data about consumer preferences, social networks or product attributes. An important but understudied aspect of these settings is how the multiplicity of sources of information available to consumers and firms affects their decisions, as well as the diverse ways in which this information is interpreted. For example, different past experiences and views of the world may lead individuals to interpret information in starkly different ways. A central objective of the proposed work is to identify the inefficiencies of information production and aggregation that emerge when the informational environment is complex, and to understand the ways in which these inefficiencies can be ameliorated via appropriate restructuring and regulation of the informational environment. There are many possible interventions. For example, a policymaker can release information by making a public announcement or seeding information with specific individuals, restructure the environment by restricting certain kinds of data sharing, or influence how individuals interpret information by providing information about others' preferences or beliefs. The projects funded by this award develop theoretical frameworks for clarifying the differences between these interventions and identifying which are most effective. These findings will be of practical use to inform policy regarding the design, dissemination, and regulation of information. Further, the problem of how to regulate data markets is of recent interest in many disciplines, including computer science, law, and sociology. The research will contribute to this interdisciplinary literature by focusing on the economic consequences to 'big data' production and usage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan proposal consists of three projects. The first project focuses on the production of data when agents have access to many interrelated sources of information. The second proposes a model in which information about consumers is pooled across various markets and examines the consequences of sharing this information with firms. The third project considers how agents learn from their peers when they have mis-specified models of inference and seeks to characterize how an information planner can release information or modify the informational environment to facilitate learning. Although there is a classic and well-developed economics literature on learning and information acquisition, consideration of heterogeneity in sources and information-processing models has only recently begun to attract interest. For example, the learning literature has mostly focused on agents with correctly-specified models (i.e. Bayesian learners with priors that put positive weight on the true model). While more recent work has focused on the case where agents have mis-specified models, the question of what happens when agents with different mis-specified models interact is an important open channel for research. Similarly, the information acquisition literature has mostly studied learning from a single source, focusing on questions such as how much information should an agent acquire, and at what level of precision. Recent work introduces diverse information sources and studies dynamic information acquisition patterns. But study of the economic interactions between agents who aggregate information across diverse sources, e.g. in market settings, where firms aggregate information across consumers and markets for screening, remains incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will compare these measures of data quality and costs in VM and VS interviews carried out by the same professional interviewers and in conventional online (textual) self-administered questionnaires, asking the same survey questions to members of a representative sample who are randomly assigned to one of these three modes. Because VM is synchronous and ""live"" like face-to-face (FTF) interviewing, and VS is asynchronous and recorded but still projects a human face, the project's comparisons will provide new insights regarding how these decomposable aspects of human contact affect behavior and experience in surveys. The project's results will reveal the extent to which, and for whom, less costly interaction (live but remote vs. recorded) with an interviewer promotes engagement and data quality comparable to what is found in similar FTF interviews. More generally, the findings will address when and in what ways modern communication modes that reduce social presence and are less personal might be equal to or even more effective than FTF interaction. Findings from this project will provide valuable information relevant to the future of survey measurement and will be of interest to survey researchers in the Federal statistical system and other survey organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even as survey data continue to be central to public policy and decision-making, survey measurement is challenged by declining response rates, increasing costs, declining trust in survey organizations, and rapidly changing communication habits among the public.  Understanding how video technologies could fit into the future of survey data collection is important both because it may meet potential respondents ""where they live"" and because it may provide a significantly lower cost alternative to FTF interviewing. There is even the potential to reach some members of the public whose location makes FTF interviewing difficult or expensive, but who may well be able to participate in a video interview (e.g., people who live in remote rural areas or members of the military deployed overseas).  In comparing data quality across these three survey modes, the project will quantify participation rates, connectivity problems, respondent compliance with the video interviewing protocol, conscientious responding (giving precise answers to numerical questions, thoughtfully differentiating answers), and disclosure of sensitive information. The project will measure the potential impact of individual interviewers, feelings of engagement with the interview, rapport with the interviewer, and respondent satisfaction. The project also will allow assessment of data collection costs across these modes.  Access to and use of video technologies are not universal, and even among those with access some are willing to engage in video interaction while others are reluctant. The project will begin to address whether and how the effects of video technologies on survey data collection differ for participants with different levels of prior experience and preference for using the technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs will investigate how changes in the dialysis industry affects firm strategies, Medicare costs, and patient outcomes. The project will use a very large data set to test hypothesis drawn from the economic theory of firm competition. The research has three distinct components. The first part focuses on how mergers and acquisitions affect firm strategy in this industry and the consequences for patient outcomes. The second component evaluates how regulations that affect the construction of new facilities influence market structure as well as patient outcomes. The third part analyzes a payment reform instituted by Medicare that reduced the incentives to over-prescribe injectable drugs, which again may have affected both Medicare's costs and patient's outcomes. Understanding the market for dialysis services is important for several reasons. Dialysis is an important component of health insurance costs; Medicare's annual total reimbursements for dialysis amount to about 1% of the entire federal budget. High quality dialysis care improves patients' lives. Finally, understanding how changes in competition and in Medicare policies have affected the dialysis market will give us new knowledge about how robust competition and sensible regulation and Medicare reimbursement policies may be able to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will use claims data from the entire universe of U.S. dialysis patients between 1998 and 2014; during this time period the industry became more concentrated. The projects funded by this award look at three different aspects of consolidation in the dialysis industry. The first studies how large dialysis chains have transferred their corporate strategies to the numerous independent facilities they acquired, which ultimately can affect the cost and quality of their treatments. The second develops a structural model of dialysis firms' entry, exit, and acquisition decisions to (i) understand how market structure and regulation affect dialysis care and (ii) estimate the impact of counterfactual policies, such as blocking mergers or relaxing Certificate of Need laws. The third examines how Medicare's reimbursement policies shape dialysis facilities' behavior, focusing specifically on a reform in 2011 that changed Medicare's reimbursement scheme for injectable drugs from a per-dose payment to a bundled payment. The team will use a novel instrumental variable strategy to provide the first causal evidence in the literature about whether the bundled payment policy resulted in lower drug doses, reduced costs and improved outcomes.

Moreover, these discourses about conservation, both within academia and the general population, often focus on broad social categories, such as ideological affiliation, and socioeconomic status, and ignore the more complex perspectives of local communities. This project addresses that gap by highlighting the viewpoints of rural American stakeholders, who constitute a large and very active group in conservation activities, with historically deep roots to conservation. They are therefore a crucial focus for the investigation of language and identity in environmental ideologies and practices, and their ties to both conservatism and environmental conservation demonstrate the need for community-level analyses of conservation discourse. This research will contribute to a more inclusive understanding of conservation in several ways. First, the research will assist scholars and practitioners in communicating science to the public. Moreover, this project will also create a collaboration between the academy and rural western stakeholders. Rural populations in the western United States are understudied within anthropology and the other social sciences that study conservation, and the proposed study, which will be completed in collaboration with a conservation organization that serves a rural audience, will bring new, and often overlooked, voices into the academy and into discussions of conservation. The study is also a timely addition to the interdisciplinary field of environmental science. Findings from this study will make important contributions to improving the robustness and reliability of cultural anthropological and linguistic science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jessica Love-Nichols, under the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz of the University of California at Santa Barbara, will test whether theories concerning conversation discourse and listener perception are reliable when subject to variance in geography and sociolinguistic style. In order to ensure that the analysis is relevant to the perspectives of the rural communities, a mixed-methods approach will be used for data collection. The researcher will first collect and analyze ethnographic data through interviews and recorded participant observation, which will ensure that the subsequent quantitative data collection and analysis are rooted in an understanding of the ideologies and practices of the community. Ethnographic data will be collected through participant observation of hunter education courses and hunting and fishing activities, and interviews with sportsmen and women. Experimental data from a sociolinguistic perception task will then be collected and analyzed. Participants will listen to several conservation-related audio clips. In one version of the clips, the speakers will use a more ""country""-sounding (i.e. rural) way of speaking. In another, they will read the message in a non-rural guise. For each audio segment, participants will be asked to answer several survey questions evaluating their attitudes and perceptions of the speaker, testing the hypothesis that clips which are sociolinguistically-aligned with rurality will be perceived as more authentic and hence more trustworthy when a pro-conservation stance is taken. After completing the survey, speakers will be given the opportunity to express longer opinions in written form. Findings from this research will expand understandings of the conservation values and practices of an overlooked community and will assist scholars and practitioners interested in conservation in engaging with a wide variety of audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is because we are constantly adapting our movements to compensate for changes in the state of the body (e.g., muscle fatigue) and world (e.g., a slippery sidewalk). Thus, each new action can be thought of as a form of generalization based on previous actions. Current theories seeking to explain the pattern of generalization rest on the idea that the brain's representation of motor behaviors is rooted in the physical features of movement, such as in the muscles and joints involved. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project takes an alternate approach to consider more psychological aspects of motor behavior - such as whether an individual thinks that the goal of two given actions is the same and consequently the individual believes they should behave in the same way. Exploring the possibility that generalization may be governed by representations rooted in a psychological dimension will lead to a more comprehensive theory of generalization and greater effectiveness of practical applications. Modern society includes many tools and digital devices that people learn and interact with. Principles gleaned from this project will inform better design of tools that speed user learning by leveraging generalization of previously existing skills. Additionally, results of this work could optimize neurorehabilitation protocols for patients of stroke and other causes of loss of motor ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaches from the fields of motor control and cognitive psychology will be used to determine if the pattern of human motor generalization is better characterized by representations in a psychological space. First, to gain insight into psychological factors, participants will be asked to judge the perceptual and subjective similarity between two movements in various task configurations, which are common to traditional studies of motor generalization. Participants will then experience a standard sensorimotor learning task, the visuomotor rotation task, to determine how their judgments of psychological similarity predict how they generalize learning in one region of space to new regions of space. Correlations between the pattern of similarity judgments and the pattern of motor generalization will provide the first step toward establishing the influence of psychological factors on generalization. Next, the exploration of psychological factors will be deepened by determining if broader conceptual assumptions regarding the goals of the task govern the pattern of generalization. To test this idea, participants' knowledge of tool functions will be used to define a psychological similarity space. Here, participants will categorize various tools in terms of similarity and multidimensional scaling techniques will be employed to determine a distance metric between these tools in a psychological space. Participants will then train to move with these tools in the visuomotor rotation task to determine the extent to which generalization between tools is defined by their relative distance in a psychological space. Critically, throughout the project, the physical aspects of these movements will be controlled, such that any changes to the pattern of generalization will provide evidence in support of a more psychological representation underlying generalization. If successful, these studies will lead to a more comprehensive theory of human motor generalization, one that accounts not only for how the mind interacts with motor function in the manipulation of tools, but also how tool function may shape and influence mind and motor function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a basic daily necessity, salt was scarce at inland cities so its production on the coast figures into supply and demand of a good distributed at inland marketplaces in cities, towns, and smaller communities. Previous archaeological survey, mapping, and transect excavations indicated massive salt production. However, there were unanswered questions about the workforce, including if they lived near the salt works or elsewhere, if production was organized by households who worked individual salt kitchens or by day or seasonal workers from elsewhere. The researchers will carry out aerial excavations inside multiple buildings and in the adjacent yards at two large archaeological sites to identify residential, production, and other uses. In addition, excavations will be carried out at smaller sites in five different areas of the salt works. Interdisciplinary collaboration includes study of mineralogy of pottery to identify the sources of manufacture as a proxy for the locations of inland markets and consumers. The study incorporates soil chemistry to identify chemical residues of activities, along with quantitative and spatial evaluation of salt production tools. Species identification and radiocarbon dating of wooden posts as well as column samples of the earth beside posts will evaluate the ancient landscape and timing of building construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Severe natural disasters during the past decade include unprecedented flooding, catastrophic hurricanes, and devastating wildfires.  The worst wildfire in California history struck Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017.  The Thomas Fire in those counties burned 282,000 acres, took two lives, and incinerated or damaged over one thousand structures. Because of its location to major population centers, over 100,000 residents were evacuated, many more than once.  In the aftermath of the fire, rain produced a massive mudslide cascading through the city of Montecito killing 23 people and destroying 115 homes.  These catastrophic events within a geographically concentrated region offer a unique opportunity to better understand how individuals and families cope with and recover from profound stress.  The focus of this project is to gain a richer understanding of how individuals and families manage post-disaster recovery and what predicts both positive and negative outcomes. By bringing together a multi-disciplinary team of computer scientists and disaster psychologists, new theories and computational methods will be evaluated to better understand human response to extreme events and to inform the development of future interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Smart Phone technology and online surveys over a six-month period of time, 100 parent/child pairs and 100 non-parent survivors in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties will be followed.  The surveys and the daily ""check-ins"" will provide critical data on how people cope with stress across time.  By cultivating a very rich set of data on the same individuals over time, it will be possible to discern patterns of recovery in ways that past research has not done.  Measuring outcomes on a daily basis will generate significant data and support the use of ""big data"" analysis methods (e.g., machine learning techniques) that can identify unique changes or shifts in functioning predicted by the guiding theoretical framework (self-regulation shift theory).  This project extends what is currently understood related to post-disaster recovery by targeting key coping mechanisms of change and highlighting possible critical targets for supportive interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many people enthusiastically want to meet broad goals, such as health and fitness, but have trouble enacting the effortful, resource-consuming actions that are required to do so. For example, many people who are strongly committed to increasing their physical fitness may plan with all earnestness on getting to the gym every morning or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, but ultimately fail to do so. These kinds of self-control failures are common and have wide-scale consequences for mental and physical health. Psychological science has shown that to understand self-control, it is not enough to merely measure what people say they think and feel about a goal and the actions needed to get to that goal. Instead, it is necessary to also measure people's spontaneous and uncontrollable thoughts and feelings about goals and the means for achieving those goals. This type of implicit cognition can predict who will and who may not end up successfully enacting the difficult activities required to reach their goals. Laboratory experiments and a field study with high school students will improve our understanding of how people frame, strengthen, and bolster their behaviors in self-control dilemmas. The research will ultimately have applications in understanding health, education, and personal finances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines a neglected aspect of the psychology of self-control: people's implicit beliefs about the importance of means. In addition to knowing how much someone desires a broad goal, it is also necessary to know a person's beliefs about the importance of the actions needed to reach that goal. For example, one might greatly desire to be fit, but unless they regard the difficult actions required to become fit as important and critical, they may not enact those behaviors. The hypothesis tested across the studies in this project is that people's implicit beliefs about the importance of means will uniquely predict their success at self-control. Some of the studies use an established measure of implicit importance. Other studies develop an innovative new measure that captures people's nonconscious beliefs about the importance of goal-relevant actions. The studies also examine the self-control domains of physical fitness and academic performance among college and high school students. A final study includes high school students in underserved communities who are trying to get into college. This study follows these students across a school year, measures the students' implicit beliefs about the importance of school-related actions (using two different measures), and predicts critical outcomes such as grades and college entry. The fields of self-control and goal-pursuit might be transformed by introducing the role of implicit importance. By focusing on evidence that implicit importance predicts behavioral outcomes, this project offers the potential to advance an underdeveloped topic in the research literature on self-control.

This project asks what coastal citizens value about the American shore in the near future, and how their investments intersect with the long-term goals of ecological restoration science. On the one hand, how do the promises of restoration science affect the way people whose livelihoods depend upon the coast approach their own environmental management practices in the present? On the other hand, what kinds of local histories and epistemological orientations inform the far-future goals of ecological restoration? Situated in southern Louisiana, where state-funded, large-scale infrastructural projects aim to recover lost wetlands and rejuvenate the state's coastal communities, this research will investigate the concept of ecological restoration in Louisiana, asking how the possibility of restoring the Louisiana coast is affecting local expectations of the future environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannah Burnett, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago, will explore whether the unprecedented rates of wetland erosion along the Louisiana coast have shaped expectations and behaviors along different temporal scales. In the wake of several largescale disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 BP oil spill, Louisiana has proposed to install several river diversions that will re-route sections of the lower Mississippi River, releasing sediment-rich water across eroding wetlands in order to build new land. These infrastructural projects aim to rebuild Louisiana's rapidly eroding coast by mimicking the natural flood events that slowly accumulate into the state's wetlands. The project described here will take place in the coastal communities in southeastern Louisiana that will be most directly affected by these river diversions. By interviewing local fisherpeople and accompanying them in their daily practices, the researchers propose to shed light on the different cycles that fisherpeople rely upon, examining the moments when these cycles are affected by the longer-term goals of wetland restoration. In addition, the researchers will conduct interviews with restoration scientists, along with archival research, to better understand the history of ecological restoration in Louisiana, the metrics that determine progress towards restoration, and the timescales at which scientists project restoration will be achieved. The project will contribute to debates in anthropology, STS, and disaster science more broadly about environmental change, temporality, human behavior, and coastal ecologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The collection and burning of wood, plant, or dung-based fuels is an essential daily task in the lives of people living in non-industrial societies, on par with the acquisition of food and shelter. Archaeologists have often noted that deforestation quickly follows the emergence of socio-economically complex societies and early states as a result of increased fuel needs. As populations grew and economic activities intensified, maintaining an adequate supply of fuel resources would have been increasingly important. This study examines how fuel economies change in response to a shift towards increasing socioeconomic and political complexity. While the developed world no longer relies on wood or dung fuels, many areas of the developing world still depend on access to forests and pasturelands to supply their daily energy needs. By exploring how people in early complex societies coped with fuel needs and fuel scarcity, this research will contribute to national and global discussions about the role of energy resources in sustainable economic development. An understanding of how socioeconomic factors affect how people collect and use fuel resources over long periods of time is essential to the development of forest conservation and environmental policies that can balance energy needs with the preservation of natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers use archaeobotany, the study of how plants and people interact, and geoarchaeological techniques, to identify and interpret fuel remains from three archaeological sites located in Northern Mesopotamia that date to the Late Chalcolithic (ca. 5300-3100 BC) and Assyrian (1300-611 BC) periods. The Late Chalcolithic in this region saw the emergence of the first socio-economically complex villages and cites, while the Assyrian period witnessed the development of the expansive Assyrian Empire, which fundamentally transformed land use patterns across the region and local administrative control of resources. Combining multiple lines of evidence from carbonized seed and wood remains, microscopic calcitic ash residues, and ethnoarchaeological data, will provide a rigorous evaluation of what fuel types were used at each site, whether different fuels or different wood species were preferred for certain tasks or by people of different statuses, and how fuel affected land use practices. The results of this project will contribute to three larger collaborative research projects that bring together international researchers and local archaeologists from Iraqi Kurdistan, Syria, and Turkey in order to study the early development of social complexity in an area of endangered cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Survey data have shown that compared to individuals in other countries, Americans display higher tolerance toward outcome inequality and more aversion to redistributive policies. One influential explanation for this phenomenon is that Americans tend to believe they have been living in a mobile society in which individual success is only modestly determined by family background. However, considerable research shows that such perceptions of social mobility are not aligned with reality. This project will test whether correcting  misperceptions of social mobility can alter attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. By receiving accurate information about social mobility in the United States, individuals who turn out to have overestimated (underestimated) mobility will become less (more) tolerant of economic inequality and demand more (less) redistribution. Findings of this project will contribute to our understanding about social mobility and inequality by highlighting the importance of individual subjective perceptions, and provide input into social policies regarding redistribution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will test hypotheses using an online survey experiment. Recruited subjects will first answer a series of survey questions regarding their perceptions of social mobility in the United States relative to some other developed countries. Subjects in the treatment group, but not in the control group, will immediately receive correct answers to these questions. All subjects, regardless of treatment status, will be asked to report their attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. Hypotheses suggest there will be attitudinal shifts when individual misperceptions are corrected. Six hundred subjects will be recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Another 1,000 subjects will be recruited via a Qualtrics Online Sample, which will resurvey participants after one week of the initial contact to evaluate if the treatment effects persist.

Linguistic choices affect the experience of the viewing audience and the sale of commercial media products.  Attention to language is especially crucial, commercially and politically, for transnational companies that wish to localize their media products for wider distribution. The research supported by this award asks how different agents involved in this process negotiate their choices and what this can tell us about political relationships that cannot be otherwise understood.  Successful localization requires collaboration between translators, voice actors, directors, sound engineers, and distributors, all of whom possess their own beliefs about language representation.  How do these professionals negotiate their different stances about language? What are the decision-making and interactional processes behind the scenes? And what do these decision-making processes reveal about the political contexts in which they take place? To answer these questions, University of California, Los Angeles anthropology doctoral candidate Spencer C. Chen, supervised by Dr. Paul V. Kroskrity, will conduct a close anthropological and linguistic investigation of the role of media translation in localizing imported cultural products. Attention to this highly-specialized industry provides a unique research opportunity to understand how creators construct media representations through language and voice, and the larger political and economic effects of those constructions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be carried out in Taipei, Taiwan, one of the cultural production centers for Chinese arts and Mandarin media in the Greater China Region. This site is uniquely situated to provide a linguistic anthropological understanding of how sound translation professionals make ideological moves with language to navigate sociolinguistic boundaries, commercial markets, and geopolitical uncertainties. The researcher will conduct a focal-following mobile ethnography to closely track this process. He will record their behind-the-scenes discussions and collect more in-depth information through semi-structured interviews and sociolinguistic analysis of Mandarin-dubbed products. This research design will allow the researcher to document ""outspoken"" linguistic stereotypes but also reveal ""unspoken"" language ideologies. Findings from this study will permit a new perspective on how politicized and socially-encoded messages are crafted and transmitted across different media markets.

Researchers studying the transmission or spread of cultural practices in the ancient past rely largely on material and physical remains. Archaeology is especially well-suited to address these questions because it combines a critical engagement with material culture with a concern with change and interaction over time and space. In this context, writing presents an ideal case for exploring cultural transmission because of the material traces that it leaves and because its physical aspects are often ignored at the expense of its more abstract message. Mallory Matsumoto (Brown University) will undertake dissertation research to understand the production and transmission of writing. In addition to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeology, epigraphy, and anthropology, this work will demonstrate how interaction in one cultural context may affect another, an issue relevant to understanding both the past and the present. In addition to contributing to current understanding of pre-Columbian Maya civilization, the results will be especially relevant to contemporary Maya communities given their current efforts revive the hieroglyphic script as a symbol of identity and cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research will examine if and how the networks through which writing is transmitted overlap with other contexts of cultural exchange. Its case study will be the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, which was used for over 1500 years in areas of what are now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Critically, the writing system was shared among pre-Columbian Maya communities who were not only separated by space and time, but also were never politically unified. Although the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs has advanced significantly in recent decades, scholars still do not understand how the writing system developed and spread. The investigator will analyze the form of Maya inscriptions and the hieroglyphs they contain to reconstruct which settlements were sharing which writing techniques, how these patterns changed over time, and how they related to interactions in other contexts like politics, warfare, or trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses.

Growing evidence suggests that some early life biological effects, such as those triggered by psychosocial stress, can persist into adulthood and in some cases influence offspring and grandoffspring development. This doctoral research project will use existing survey data, and newly collected data and biological samples, to examine life course and intergenerational effects of early life stress experienced by now young-adult mothers who were exposed to highly adverse social conditions.  The research will advance knowledge about potential biological pathways of multigenerational effects of stress in humans, and contribute more broadly to our understanding of the complex interplay between human biology and culture. The outcomes of this project will contribute valuable data that may inform public health research and policy. The project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers have proposed that there may be multigenerational pathways of biological ""memory"" whereby an individual's biology reflects not only their own experiences and that of their mothers, but potentially also their grandmothers' experiences. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a central component of the body's system of stress response and is among the candidate outcomes likely to be influenced by such multigenerational plasticity. This study provides a unique opportunity to trace the long-term impacts of early life stress exposure to biological and social disparities, focusing on both the physiology and well-being of exposed individuals, and the birth outcomes and stress physiology of their unexposed offspring. This project will utilize existing and newly collected data for a cohort of women, their children, and grandchildren, that has been followed for nearly 30 years and that experienced highly adverse social and environmental conditions.

In some cases, they are able to return home after the factors which drove them to migrate have receded. However, in other cases they cannot return. Refugees who have fled political conflict and resettled in host countries represent one group for which return may be challenging, or ultimately impossible. Refugees also often lack economic or social resources that they can utilize after migrating, resulting in lives marked by precarity and uncertainty. While they may lack access to certain resources, language is a resource that refugees can creatively use as they navigate life in their host countries. This linguistic and anthropological project aims to understand how human beings adapt to long periods of precarity and uncertainty by examining how refugees use language in myriad social contexts: to maintain connections to their homes, assimilate themselves into their host societies, and articulate their needs or desires. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would broadly disseminating its findings, and innovate more effective methods for preserving historical and scientific records related to language documentation. Further, it would broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in science, and build capacity and scientific infrastructure through international scientific cooperation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William Cotter, under the supervision of Dr. Natasha Warner of the University of Arizona, will explore the relationship between language, performance, and the construction/retention of identity and memory in contexts of long-term displacement. Using methods drawn from linguistics and anthropology, this project investigates refugee language use through field research conducted with Palestinian refugees in the Jordanian capital of Amman. This is an apt research setting both because Palestinian refugee communities have lived in Jordan since 1948 and because many have acquired formal rights as Jordanian citizens. Through semi-structured interviews, researchers will first investigate how Arabic dialects spoken by these refugees have changed over time. Language change is common when individuals or communities migrate and come into contact with speakers of different languages or dialects. The audio data from these interviews will be subjected to statistical analysis to determine how their Arabic dialects have changed over time. Researchers will compare the results from this portion of the project to how these refugees use language in the context of performance (e.g. poetry, songs, telling stories). Examining performance will allow the researchers to see how Arabic dialects are used across contexts, and how the stylistic use of language allows refugees to situate themselves as members of the Palestinian community, while simultaneously navigating their relationship to the country in which they currently live. Findings from this research will provide insight into how refugees experience life in the diaspora and how they use language as a tool to articulate their place in their communities and integrate themselves into their host country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The FW-HTF cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. This award fulfills part of that aim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a closed-loop embodied Intelligent Cognitive Assistant (e-ICA) to infer circadian rhythm, alertness, and stress levels and to provide personalized feedback to enhance users' cognitive ability and wellbeing in an unobtrusive and effortless manner. Approximately 20% of the labor force engages in shift work, which often leads to inadequate and poor sleep. Being out of synch with one's natural body clock, or circadian rhythm, can lead to many complications over time, including a higher likelihood for cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, and mental health problems. In addition, there can be serious deficits in cognitive performance, with productivity loss and more accidents in the workplace. This research program will design and develop a novel sensor-based e-ICA that can monitor shift workers' circadian rhythms, sleep patterns, and stress levels. The platform will be flexible so that it can be used to study broad populations in addition to shift workers. Given that 70 percent of the population suffers from circadian rhythm disruption, this technology has the potential to impact a wide range of workers and firms. In addition, the anonymized data and information about developed hardware and software will be shared in the community. The technology will impact the needs of a broad cross-section of stakeholders, but will be tested initially with medical residents and other health practitioners who typically work long shift that change every few weeks. Moreover, this project will also allow interdisciplinary cross fertilization between science, engineering, psychology, sleep and circadian biology, and psychiatry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators explore ways to provide biologically and physiologically attuned support in the areas of cognitive ability, performance, sleep, and well-being based on the inferred individual circadian rhythm and personalized embodied assistance by: a) passively and continuously gathering behavioral and physiological streams through wearable, mobile and remote devices from workers in an effortless manner; b) continuously inferring each person's individual circadian rhythm, alertness, and stress in daily life settings; and c) providing personalized multi-sensory feedback or actionable behavioral suggestions to modulate circadian rhythm, alertness and stress levels with the aim of  enhancing cognitive ability, performance and wellbeing.

The question of how this ability is enabled by the human brain is one of the central challenges of cognitive science.  The most common approach to answering this question has concentrated on documenting the language processing abilities of typically developing young adults, generating accounts of language processing abilities that are shared by all human beings. Although this standard approach has produced many crucial insights into human language, it fails to explain a number of ways in which language processing ability is not the same in all people but rather varies substantially across different individuals or groups of people.  Among typically developing young adults, there are well-documented individual differences in cognitive abilities--for instance, people vary in their ability to hold information in mind and manipulate that information--which can shape language processing ability. Moreover, language processing ability changes across the lifespan, as people develop from childhood to old age, and thus the story of human language processing is about more than just young adults. Finally, some groups of people are congenitally atypical in terms of cognitive or perceptual abilities, as in the case of blindness or deafness, and this has important implications for language and language processing.  Progress in understanding the variability of language processing ability is of pressing importance, because language is the primary means of communication in nearly all facets of modern human life, including school, work, and media environments. Understanding the nature of variations in language processing ability will aid in identifying individuals who need help and in developing methods for helping them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop on Variation in the Mechanisms of Human Language Processing will be held in conjunction with the 2019 Annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing (March 29-31, at the University of Colorado, Boulder). The Conference on Human Sentence Processing is the premier event in North America for research on how humans comprehend and produce language. The workshop will convene researchers working on different aspects of variation in the mechanisms of language processing, including a group of experts in the area. The workshop will enable scientific discussion amongst researchers focused on variation in language processing and mainstream psycholinguistic researchers which will enhance our understanding of variation in language processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates interactions of vowels and consonant voicing (such as voiced 'd' versus voiceless 't'). In English, for instance, vowels before voiced consonants (e.g. 'feed') are longer than vowels before voiceless ones (e.g. 'feet'). Despite a long research history, such interactions are still poorly understood. The empirical focus of this project is on two understudied language varieties, Franconian (spoken in parts of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands) and Low German (spoken in Northern Germany). In Franconian, vowel-consonant interactions have led to a tone contrast, comparable to Chinese languages; Low German has developed 'extra-long' vowels alongside long and short vowels, which is exceedingly rare across languages. This project will document and explain these developments, with important implications for linguistic typology and the study of cognitive underpinnings of language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of an empirical, a theoretical, and a typological part. The empirical part investigates how speakers of modern dialects produce and perceive the vowels and consonants. The results form the basis for the theoretical studies. These studies aim to explicate the mechanisms at play and illuminate how understanding them furthers our knowledge of mechanisms of sound change. The typological part of the project relates the empirical and theoretical findings to comparable phenomena in other languages, which will improve our understanding of interactions between vowels and consonant voicing cross-linguistically. The combined empirical, theoretical, and typological studies will help broaden our knowledge of central issues that are at the heart of current debates in the field of phonology, viz. the structure of phonological representations, the interaction of such representations with the production and perception of phonological contrasts (phonetics), and the role of sound change in shaping phonological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because companies in the sharing economy span a range of services, and because their platforms have become hugely popular, local actors and organizations are now in a political struggle over the implications for other markets and regulatory policy. Such contentious politics have brought into question the viability of sharing economy platforms as city policymakers consider revising local regulations to accommodate the platforms or in some cases, banning them wholly. Most research on the development of new markets focuses either on the social structures that facilitate a market's emergence or on the politics involved to adapt it to existing norms and rules. This project synthesizes the two different perspectives to examine how one of the largest markets in the sharing economy, the short-term rental or ?home-sharing? sector, develops in the context of other local structures and politics. Findings from this research will show new configurations of power emerging from local sharing economy markets. These findings will also contribute to public conversation and policy discussions on the sharing economy, market regulation, lobbying and municipal government transparency.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research combines the richness of qualitative investigation with the scope of computational and quantitative methods. Specifically, it analyzes quantitative data from short-term rental websites, the Census, nonprofit organizations, and hotels for 300 U.S. cities and metropolitan areas. It will also use new and original data collected by the researchers, including a dataset on municipal budgets and short-term rental ordinances as well as interview, historical, and participant observation data from a case study of short-term rentals in Los Angeles. In doing so, it extends scholarly understandings of markets to account for the ways in which the local and organizational contexts in which markets emerge also shape the politics over their regulation. Additionally, it considers the distinct resource and political constituency of sharing economy markets--the crowd--in these processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coastal dwellers are particularly vulnerable to environmental variability and natural disasters, for instance tropical storms and tsunamis. Anticipated increase in environmental variability and rising sea-levels during the coming centuries place many such communities at risk, increasing the likelihood of social unrest and potentially large scale migration out of poorer coastal areas. Predicted climatic changes are analogous to those that occurred during the mid-Holocene period, when marginally warmer global climate inundated many coastal areas. The north coast of New Guinea lies along a tectonically active zone with frequent earthquakes and resultant tsunamis, and is affected by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which produces alternating years of drought and extreme rains. The ENSO cycle intensified during the mid-Holocene at the same time that developing coastal flats may have supported increasing populations. At present, people living in coastal areas of the Southwestern Pacific utilize a variety of risk management strategies, including growing resilient tree crops such as sago palm, and maintaining wide-ranging social ties that can be drawn upon in times of need. The proposed research will examine how people on the north coast of PNG coped with varying levels of ecological risk during the mid-Holocene period, including the antiquity of tree-cropping, extent of social networks, and relative human population levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will use a combined strategy of soiling coring and archaeological survey and excavation. Soil coring will establish changes in environment including evidence of ancient tsunami events. Environmental indicators from core samples (pollen, charcoal) will be used to examine relative changes in population levels and the degree of human impact on forest composition, including the promotion of economic crops like sago palms. Archaeological survey and excavations in rock shelters and along the edges of ancient lagoons will examine the intensity of land use and provide evidence for transport of material culture, indicative of ancient social networks. The mid-Holocene was a period of increased mobility during which time new ideas and practices began to widely circulate in the Southwestern Pacific. Results will indicate how intensely people used the landscape in the context of rapid climatic shifts, how successful they were at mitigating ecological risk, how rapidly population grew, and to what extent these ecological changes may have promoted mobility in the broader Southwestern Pacific. The project will serve as a test case for anticipated outcomes of climatic and environmental change during the coming centuries in similar coastal areas. The project will also generate new ancient climate datasets of use for understanding the ENSO cycle and long-term patterns of climatic variability, as well as understanding the human role in tropical forest composition and conservation. Additionally, the project will provide training to New Guinean archaeologists and US undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The perception of time is fundamental to our conscious experience and critical to virtually all of our activities.  However, despite being a focus of research in experimental psychology since the 19th century, time perception is still incompletely understood. Previous work has suggested that the brain controls the timing of our actions and the motor system simply produces an output in response to these timed brain commands. That is, the brain decides when to move and the motor system produces the movement. However, recent research has shown that the motor system may have a much more critical role in timing and may be fundamentally necessary for the perception of time. The investigators will test this idea by having human participants move a robotic arm that can be perturbed by the experimenters. The investigators will explore whether changing the features of the robotic arm movement also alters the subject's perception of time and whether this paradigm can be used to improve the perception of time. The research program combines aspects of the decision-making and motor planning literatures and will provide novel training for graduate and undergraduate students in the two research areas. Finally, understanding timing and movements is critical to the development of brain-machine interfaces and neural prosthetics and may help support interventions in motor rehabilitation and motor disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most psychological research on time perception in humans, subjects must typically make a choice between two alternatives by pressing a button. This stands in contrast to most animal research, where animals must move to a response location. The investigators intend to bridge the gap between these two literatures with the proposed paradigm. To do this, subjects will be required to move a robotic arm to different locations, depending on their decision about an elapsed interval of time. A series of studies will test the effects of 1) adding resistance to the arm while subjects actively time an interval, 2) actively moving vs. planning a movement while timing an interval, and 3) the impact of moving while judging other, time-critical stimuli (e.g., pitch). In all studies, the investigators will use movement kinematics and dynamics to predict the choices subjects will make and will apply drift-diffusion modeling simulations to elucidate where and how movement parameters impact the perception of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecosystem services are broadly defined as the benefits humans obtain from ecosystems and the services they provide. This research will investigate what institutions and policymakers are using the concept of ecosystem services and how this use differs from previous ways of conceptualizing the environment in policy. It will also explain the potential successes and failures of this new approach in improving environmental management. Understanding the important role that social and technical factors play in shaping these concepts and use in policy is important as payments for ecosystem services have been promoted as a solution to a variety of environmental problems. This research explores how ecosystem services are used in diverse policy settings, and how the translation of ecosystem functions into monetary valuation has evolved in different contexts. The project will benefit society by highlighting what types of policies are more effective in engaging stakeholders in more appropriate ways. The project will also strengthen social science research on environmental policy-making while building improved global scientific understanding among undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing attention to ecosystem services (ES) concepts, there remain major challenges regarding clarifying the values underlying the concept and translating it into policy. These challenges include identifying what counts as an ES, ranging from physical goods like timber to regulating services like soil erosion control to more intangible ""cultural ES""; how ES can be valued in ways that incorporate diverse viewpoints and understandings of nature; and how payments or compensation for provisioning of ES can be designed and delivered in ways that are socially beneficial. This research project will aim to answer two key research questions: (1) How are ES defined, measured, and prioritized by different actors in policymaking? (2) How are different ES turned into economic values and through what means, and why are some ES paid for, while others are not? The research project will use mixed methods, including focus groups, participatory mapping, and interviews to assess local understanding, use, and valuation of ES in three watershed-based case studies, as well as interviews with national and international policymakers and scientists to understand the uptake of ES concepts, culminating in the construction of an ES database.

Brian,,Dillon,brian@linguist.umass.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,09/30/2020,15947.00,"Natural language allows humans to refer to objects in the world, but often the way that language does this is by using seemingly under-informative linguistic devices: pronouns like 'he' or 'she.' Unlike proper names like 'Harry Potter,' pronouns do not have fixed reference, and so they can only be understood relative to a given context. For this reason, they offer a direct window into how the human mind tracks information about people and things in a context. Existing research into how listeners understand pronouns has already yielded substantial insight into how they track information about different entities in a discourse. Research suggests that there is much about this process that is shared across different languages. At the same time, there is evidence that languages do vary in how pronouns refer back to discourse entities. This raises the natural question: how much of our ability to refer using language is rooted in universal features of the mind, perhaps independent of language, and how much of it comes from the specifics of the language that one happens to speak? Answers to these questions inform us of the social and cultural factors that underlie language variation and change.<br/><br/>This project investigates this question by looking at Romanian, a Romance language spoken by approximately 30 million people worldwide. Romanian appears to present a counter-example to a supposedly universal constraint on pronominal reference. In particular, in the English sentence 'Harry talked about him,' English speakers cannot naturally interpret 'him' to refer back to 'Harry.' In Romanian, this is not true, making Romanian an apparent counter-example to an otherwise robust cross-linguistic generalization. The present proposal tests hypotheses for why Romanian speakers can interpret pronouns in this apparently exceptional fashion. The researchers will investigate how different features of the context, such as the potential referential ambiguity of a pronoun and its syntactic position, impact the interpretations Romanian speakers assign to pronouns, as well as what types of pronouns Romanian speakers choose in production to refer to different antecedents within a context. The investigators take a psycholinguistic approach to their research questions, using a version of the picture description paradigm to investigate the production of pronouns, and a version of the preferential looking task to investigate comprehension. The proposed studies are the first of their kind on Romanian, and their results will be of interest to both theoretical linguists and psycholinguists interested in how language constrains our ability to refer in context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disjunctive identities are two or more shared forms of identity that are ranked very differently. The researcher asks how these groups and the people in them manage how they see themselves and the social status assigned to them, and how outsiders respond to those management efforts. Such groups often wish to present their more highly ranked identity as a visible public face, yet they may simultaneously wish to preserve the traditions and values of their other, less esteemed identity. While a wide range of research has explored the experiences of individuals, families, or even larger subsets of groups with disjunctive identities, almost no research has been carried out among entire groups who consciously and intentionally bear one identity considered high status and the other considered much lower. This research will help policy-makers, practitioners, and social scientists understand how social groups live with and manage disjunctive identities, as well as provide models for how such groups may promote their own interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will take place in Madurai, South India, where the researcher, anthropologist Dr. Sara Dickey of Bowdoin College, has carried out ethnographic fieldwork since 1985. She has chosen to focus on the case of the Hindu Nadars, because they have historically occupied one of the lowest ranks in the caste system but today also form one of the wealthiest groups in the region, well-known for public philanthropy such as building hospitals and schools. The researcher will focus on the role of Nadar community organizations, which, for more than a century, have actively tried to control the types of Nadar behaviors and values that are made visible to the larger public and the debates about values and identities that occur within these organizations. The researcher will gather data with a mix of ethnographic methods, including participant observation, the collection of oral histories, interviews, and archival research. Findings from the research will elucidate the extent to which economic success and cultural sophistication can mitigate social discrimination, and how recent developments, such as economic globalization, have affected this process.

Yet we understand relatively little about the process of negotiating peace in civil wars. The goal of this project is to better understand the process of negotiating peace agreements to end civil conflicts. To that end, it analyzes the multiple stages of the peace process: initiation (negotiation offers), pre-bargaining (agreeing to negotiate), negotiations (reaching an agreement), and implementation (ending the conflict). Understanding each stage is important because there are often multiple starts and stops throughout the peace process. With so many killed and displaced by civil conflicts around the world, understanding the particularities of this multi-stage process, and how the actions of international actors can facilitate (or may actually hamper) the process, is of critical importance for international peace and security. This project studies the complexities of the peace process, can enable international actors to be more effective in their efforts to end civil conflicts. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While there are several studies on the outcomes of civil conflicts, as well as characteristics of the peace agreements that sometimes end them, there is a dearth of knowledge about the process itself: when and why warring parties will choose to move forward through its multiple stages and when and why they might withdraw from the process. To fill this gap, the principle investigators are drawing on primary and secondary documentation to create a comprehensive dataset on peace negotiations in civil conflicts from 1945-2016. Primary sources include UN and other international organization documents and signed peace agreements. Secondary sources include historical accounts of civil conflicts around the world. The dataset codes each stage of the negotiation process (negotiation, agreement, and implementation). If a breakdown occurred at any stage, the dataset includes detailed information on which of the parties (government or rebel group) refused to move forward in the peace process (refused to negotiate, walked away from negotiations, or failed to implement the agreement). Third-party actions such as mediation or military, economic, or diplomatic intervention will also be collected. This new dataset will allow the principle investigators to conduct a detailed, quantitative investigation of the peace process as it played out across a wide variety of civil conflicts, and the conditions under which successes or breakdowns occurred at the various stages.  The principal investigators will also address the non-random selection of belligerents into later stages of the peace process through a variety of statistical methods. The findings illuminate how governments and rebel groups can navigate the peace process in civil conflicts successfully and what role third party actors play in facilitating that process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, in contrast to past live-in arrangements, domestic work is much more likely to be performed by day workers who often live far away from their employers.  This shift in employment arrangement represents a significant spatio-temporal reorganization of the sector as workers' daily commutes might now vary, along with their daily and weekly working hours, the number of employers for whom they work, and time spent interacting with each of them.  This project will consider the significance of this reorganization by advancing theories in urban geography and the geographies of work, as well as contributing to renewed social science research interest in the micro and macro patterns of mobility.  This project focuses on the domestic employment relationship, but the findings will contribute to the ongoing reformulation of concepts to better understand labor, work, and employment in the 21st century that is increasingly service-oriented, insecure, and spatially fragmented.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project pays close attention to the increasing spatial and temporal fragmentation of paid domestic work and its significance for workers, employers, and wider society.  The project is centered on the following questions: (1) How has the spatio-temporal reorganization of paid domestic work impacted the daily lives of domestic workers and employers, particularly the household organization and management strategies of each? (2) What are the implications of these spatio-temporal changes for: a) the domestic employment relationship, and b) domestic worker organizing efforts for better working conditions? (3) How might longstanding social relations associated with the employer-employee relationship and the place of paid domestic work in society be changing in response to the reorganization of the sector?  These research questions will be answered through a mixed methods approach including content analysis of domestic employment job postings and news media sources, descriptive data analysis of government data, participant observation of union activities, key informant interviews with union leaders, and in-depth interviews with domestic workers and employers.  Interviews with workers will include the collection of time-diaries to develop time-space paths as a way of understanding the lived experience of navigating this increasingly fragmented work. The study will investigate these questions in Brazil but will be translatable to other contexts where domestic work is also a significant part of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to examine this process of ""motor re-learning"" in complex motor tasks. This project is significant because it will advance theoretical understanding of the principles that drive motor re-learning, and illuminate how these principles can be used to develop new methods of training in healthy individuals. The project includes study of re-learning in violinists, generating outreach and broadening participation in STEM research, and building knowledge of motor learning in musical performance. The project will involve an educational component that provides training to graduate and undergraduate students in conducting research. The knowledge to be gained may have important implications for enhancing movement rehabilitation in individuals with physical disabilities, thereby advancing fundamental science supporting the national health and welfare.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Learning one motor skill can exert a powerful influence on subsequent motor learning. These effects can either promote or hinder learning, and can persist for months or years. Motor learning is complex, as even behaviors that seem quite simple can depend on coordination of multiple joints and multiple muscles. This project will alter this dependence, using a human-computer interface. Humans will learn to move a cursor on a screen using gestures.  The experiment will change the function mapping the gestures into cursor movement, across or within training sessions. The expected findings will advance theories of motor learning, which largely ignore the existence and influence of previously learned coordination patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Remembering one thing can remind of us another. This can be a blessing, as when a song transports you back in time to relive a fond memory. Or it can be a curse, as when seeing a colleague reminds you of a missed deadline. Controlling which memories come to mind influences one's well-being. This research will study why certain memories become linked and the processes that allow us to search for specific memories and avoid others. Existing work has often used tasks that simplify real-world memories by having participants only study random words. We will look at how adding real-world complexities to tasks impacts behavior. Another feature of our work is the use of computer models to simulate the cognitive mechanisms hypothesized to underlie memory search. These simulations allow us to evaluate theories of memory. This work will also help educate the next generation of scientists. We will train graduate students in our laboratory and develop a workshop for local high schools. Students will collect and analyze data. This will introduce them to both memory science and computer programing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has two scientific objectives: Objective 1 is to elucidate the computational basis of interactions between time-based and meaning-based associations. Events that occur nearby in time tend to be related by meaning, but typical free-recall tasks lack meaning-based relations between items. Therefore, subjects rely heavily on time-based associations to guide memory search: recalling a word and using it as a cue to recall another that was studied nearby in time. But recent data reveal that subjects all but abandon time-based associations when lists contain strong meaning-based associations. To ascertain how temporal and semantic information interact to guide memory search, our experiments will vary the number and nature of semantic associations in lists. Our simulations will test the hypothesis that such interactions can be explained by representing semantic similarity and temporal proximity in separate layers of a network. Objective 2 is to elucidate the computational principles enabling control processes to change the dynamics of memory encoding and search. We often form new memories without trying and later find that cues bring them spontaneously to mind. Other times, we deliberately encode information which we will need to accomplish some goal. But most laboratory memory tasks are not quite like these situations: subjects deliberately memorize items but only for the sake of rote memory and not for a specific goal. Recent data show that both incidental and goal-directed encoding markedly alter subjects' reliance on time-based associations. This suggests that control processes, which allow the memory system to adapt to different task demands, are critical determinants of how memory is organized. To ascertain how control processes change the balance of time- vs. meaning-based organization during both encoding and retrieval, our experiments will provide subjects with a goal and vary the type of association most relevant to that goal. Our simulations will test the hypothesis that the influence of goals can be accounted for by adding a goal representation layer to the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how words combine to express new meanings in a predictable (and therefore unlimited) way has been the focus of decades of research, and has led to increasing success by artificial intelligence systems in responding to direct queries, such as asking for directions, weather, etc. However, the meaning of language in face-to-face interactions is influenced by factors beyond just words, and even beyond intonation: nonlinguistic visual information interacts clearly and regularly with speech. For example, when someone says they ""took a note"" while moving their fingers as if they were typing on a keyboard, this conveys that the note was electronic; as another example, a pointing gesture toward someone while saying ""my neighbor"" identifies the person with the label. Technology currently exists to recognize most of these movements, but they are typically ignored for the purpose of meaning since so little is known about how they contribute and compose with other parts of a sentence. A source of valuable insight for this question comes from languages which are entirely visual: sign languages such as American Sign Language have their own full distinct grammar and their own complex rules for the meanings of word combinations, and at the same time clearly and regularly integrate visual demonstrations and pointing into sentence meaning.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project compares the role of visual (demonstrations and pointing) information in gestures used in English with well-documented counterparts in American Sign Language. It builds on current work by the project team in theoretical models of sign language linguistics and gesture, expanding to include state-of-the-art experimental methodologies and analysis. English and American Sign Language will be studied at each point in parallel, both by gathering quantitative data using responses to videos presented online and by analyzing fluent language productions. A major challenge is that research on the compositional processes that underlie how words combine into more complex meanings requires a dolid background in logic and computation, and scholars with this skill set tend to have limited overlap with the Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and fluent signing scholars who have the most insight into the quickly growing fields of sign linguistics and gesture. To correct for this gap, the project will include training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate students and undergraduates whose studies are focused on sign languages and gesture, to provide experience with experimental methodology, statistical analysis, and logic and computation.

Listeners might differ in early auditory encoding, which affects the reliability, hence weighting, of certain cues that support phonological contrasts. Listeners might also differ in cue integration strategy such that some utilize a continuous cue integration strategy whereby cue information is integrated as they become available, while others might employ a buffer strategy so that phonemic identification is postponed until all necessary information becomes available.

Economic losses from extreme weather disasters are spatially concentrated in states like Florida and are remarkably stable over time. While there are many reasons that people stay in disaster-prone areas, others choose to migrate or are forced to leave, some temporarily and others permanently. As economic actors, migrants take with them myriad economic activities that constitute economic losses that have not been studied in previous research. This project will be the first to document the size of economic losses via migration from affected areas in the U.S. after extreme weather events. Because migration necessarily connects places to one another, the project will also document whether and to what extent such economic losses via migration contribute to changing spatial inequality in the U.S. as a whole. Project results will provide input into policies concerning how to mitigate the economic costs of extreme weather disasters in the U.S., thus contributing to disaster recovery and economic prosperity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project uses county-level data from the Statistics of Income program at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) to document and analyze economic losses via migration from affected areas after extreme weather disasters in the U.S. over the past two decades. Total economic losses via migration are measured in the IRS and CCP data using information on aggregate adjusted gross income and debt-financed consumption activities, respectively. After summarizing the size of economic losses via migration from affected areas after extreme weather disasters, the project will use demographic decomposition procedures to distinguish the relative contributions of economic components (average, or per capita, economic losses via migration) and demographic components (the propensity to migrate, as well as population size in the affected area). Further acknowledging the inherently spatial character of migration, this project also documents whether and to what extent economic losses via migration from affected areas after extreme weather disasters contribute to changing spatial inequality in the U.S. using two variants of the Gini Index that measure spatial focusing among flows in migration networks. Given heterogeneity in the relationship between extreme weather disasters and migration, this project takes a case-specific and comparative approach, focusing on three types of extreme weather disasters, including tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and wildfires, in counties that have experienced the bulk of economic losses over the last twenty years according to the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Environmental variability that generally epitomizes the homelands of mobile societies has often fostered a romanticized perception of nomadic people as ""stoic"" figures that are the product of a long life, lived in isolation, always moving as the natural environment dictates.  Subsequently, researchers studying the processes through which large scale socially complex societies emerge and the mechanisms which bind members together into a functioning unit will often ignore mobile societies in favor of ""stable"" sedentary populations. This project argues that the distinctiveness of pastoral nomadic society allows analysis of general questions of political organization in relation to a wider range of variables and thereby provides insight into how political strategies play out differently over a range of varying conditions. Ultimately, the research will do much to illustrate how ""mobile"" polities provide examples of alternative trajectories for the development of alternative political systems and as such should provide better insight into the ways in which human societies do or do not adopt more complex forms of organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this research topic, Dr. William Gardner of Yale University, along with colleagues in Mongolia, will explore the ""bottom-up"" processes at play in the local acceptance, configuration, and enactment of political changes during the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (ca. 10th to 4th century B.C.) that eventually led to the first regional-scale polity founded on the steppe of Mongolia, The Xiongnu (ca. 3th century B.C.).  Working in the greater Burgastai/Tarvagatai region of north central Mongolia, data from the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age periods will consist of 1) trends in exchange relationships as revealed by neutron activation analysis of ceramics; 2) trends in long distance interactions and movements as understood by isotopic analysis of herd animals; and 3) the role of monumentality in sociopolitical development.  This data will be contextualized by previous archaeological research in the neighboring Egiin Gol region in an effort to determine the extent to which individual members and households were involved in a community's effort to establish itself within larger political organization.

The question asked in this project is whether a heritage language (HL) behaves like a first language (L1) because an HL is learned as a native language, or if a heritage language (HL) behaves like a second language (L2) because it is underdeveloped like an L2. In order to test this, this study investigates the grammatical and lexical processing in Vietnamese-English bilinguals. Vietnamese, a heritage and minority language in the United States, is the fourth most spoken language outside of English (U. S. Census Bureau, 2015). This shows how prevalent HL speakers are in this country, and yet, there is a limited amount of research conducted on HL processing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Many bilingual language processing models, such as the Bilingual Interactive Activation model (Dijkstra &amp; van Heuven, 2002; van Heuven, Dijkstra, &amp; Grainger, 1998) and the episodic L2 hypothesis (Jiang &amp; Forster, 2001; Witzel &amp; Forster, 2012), were proposed based on evidence from bilinguals with a dominant L1 and less-dominant L2. Little is known about the processing of a non-dominant L1. The first portion of this study examines grammatical processing in HL speakers. A preliminary study compared grammatical processing in HL Vietnamese speakers to L1 Vietnamese-dominant speakers. Findings from this study suggest that HL speakers and L1-dominant speakers decompose L1 Vietnamese compound words in a very similar manner. To further investigate whether an HL is processed like an L1 or an L2, a follow-up study testing morphological decomposition in L2 English is proposed. The second portion of this study examines lexical processing in these speakers. L1 dominant bilinguals have reliably shown that L1 words automatically activate their respective L2 translations.

Although historical underrepresentation will persist mechanically at the top levels due to the gender composition of cohorts in previous decades, recent work shows a within-cohort gender gap in tenure and promotion, even among younger graduates. Hence, women are unequally represented in STEM in academia, and are on track to remain so. The consequences of underrepresentation are numerous, both for women in those fields -- such as reduced mentorship for female graduate and undergraduate students -- and for the fields themselves, as the research is conducted by less diverse perspectives. Not engaging otherwise capable female STEM Ph.D.s. could lead to less innovation and reduced overall research productivity. This innovative study of the STEM Ph.D.-holder pipeline identifies factors that lead female Ph.D.s to be less likely than their male counterparts to enter into, and remain in, tenure-track academic positions. It applies novel methods to identify and explore personal and professional factors that contribute to women with STEM Ph.D.s selecting out of academia at various stages of the pipeline. This project supports the goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) to better understand the science and technology (S&amp;T) workforce and to improve the methodologies for assessing indicators of S&amp;T activities. It focuses on issues facing an under-represented group: female doctorates in STEM. This research will highlight the differences in research engagement, compensation, and professional outcomes for a researcher who remains compared to one who departs either academia or STEM altogether, all of which have broader societal impact. The findings from this work will potentially reshape infrastructure for research and education by encouraging employers to craft policies that attract female doctorates, as such policies may allow employers to cream-skim highly qualified female doctorates from alternate employment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), the project uses cutting-edge trajectory analysis to classify all observed job sequences among STEM Ph.D. holders into a typology of STEM career paths.

In addition, the project also compares among the identified STEM career typologies objective and subjective measures of job attributes, including compensation, engagement with the research community, and job satisfaction, separately for men and women. Hence, the project defines the set of ""career pipelines"" of Ph.D. holders (of which academia is one), which are associated with women, and which are associated with better or worse job outcomes for men and women within those pipelines.

This project will take an essential next step: the creation of a high-resolution, local-scale reconstruction of the transition to agriculture and the process of plant and animal domestication. Detailed reconstructions of local-scale forager-farmer transition are few, but are necessary to map study how ideas, plants and animals were innovated and transferred across much larger time scales and geographic areas. Although the forager-farmer transition is most often viewed dichotomously as an adoption versus an in situ scenario, Dr. Munro and colleagues will consider information exchange and the movement of plants and animals among localities in Southwest Asia via interaction networks. The project will provide student training and education, foster international collaboration and engage in public outreach. Results will be disseminated to public audiences through a museum exhibit, articles for public audiences, and a series of lectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to the study of agricultural origins by providing, a high-resolution dataset for the Upper Jordan Valley (UJV) of Israel. The UJV provides an especially interesting test case because of its unique ecological conditions created by a large fresh-water system, its low elevation and the accessibility of trade routes through the larger Rift Valley. These conditions also allow investigation of more specific socioeconomic questions about topics such as aquatic resource exploitation and the impact of climatic events like the Younger Dryas. Investigation will center on three Epipaleolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the UJV. These include Jordan River Dureijat and Nahal Ein Gev II which together will provide the first complete Epipaleolithic sequence for the UJV, and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic site of Munhatta. More specifically activities will include: (1) test excavations and sampling at Munhatta. Micromorphological, sediment, isotope and zooarchaeological sampling at this critical site will investigate animal keeping, animal mobility, animal exchange and the importance of cereal grasses; (2) the collection of a comprehensive zooarchaeological database from published Epipaleolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites from the Upper Jordan Valley and more broadly across Southwest Asia to enable a comparative meta-analysis of regional plant and animal domestication pathways, and document the range of methods and measures used to detect the process of animal and plant domestication in adjacent regions; and (3) the collection of zooarchaeological data from Jordan River Dureijat and Nahal Ein Gev II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers who study science are also interested in explaining how and why some research is particularly influential, and how scientific research evolves over time. Meeting these goals requires detailed yet scalable measures of scientific influence. Building on recent developments in network science, this project will develop and evaluate a novel measure of scientific influence -- the CD index. The CD index characterizes how scientific works (e.g., published journal articles) alter the use of the knowledge upon which they build.  Some articles build on and therefore consolidate (C) previously published research, whereas other articles depart from and therefore destabilize (D) existing knowledge. This measure offers a new, systematic way of identifying breakthrough scientific discoveries that open up novel fields, and differentiating them from more incremental, but also important, contributions that develop established areas. Results from this project should be useful to individuals involved in research policy development and implementation. For example, university administrators are moving away from a focus on sheer quantity of scientific output toward a greater appreciation for quality and impact. Results from this project will allow administrators to not only identify research that is influential in different (consolidating or destabilizing) ways, but to foster the conditions (e.g., an optimal team composition, or interdisciplinary approaches to scholarship) that promote such output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prominent theories in the economics, philosophy, and sociology of science suggest that scientific influence is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon, with different types of works potentially having different types of effects on the course of science. However, despite growing availability of data and computing power, efforts to incorporate these important theoretical insights into empirical work have been scarce. Most large-scale studies rely on quantitative bibliometrics, using journal impact factors and citation counts to proxy the amount of scientific influence exerted by a given paper or patent. But such proxies are crude and are unable to distinguish between qualitatively different types of influence. Methodologically, the measurement approach developed and evaluated in this project will more closely align empirical and theoretical work on scientific influence. Substantively, the project argues that better, more nuanced measures of scientific influence will help provide clearer and more robust answers to pressing science policy questions. To date, much of the scholarship on scientific influence is quite conflicted. Are women or women dominant teams more likely to produce influential science? Do interdisciplinary efforts facilitate transformative, influential research? The literature is rife with contradictory answers to these important questions. Applying the novel CD index to two entire corpora (JSTOR and the Web of Science)-- as this project will do -- should help resolve them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. The short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. Especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. This study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. We hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals.<br/><br/><br/>Theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies. This project seeks to examine how these dynamics play out in disaster recovery efforts for public higher education institutions and their students. We will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. The study site is Lamar University in Beaumont, TX. The administrative interviews focus on the ways in which efforts to accommodate and support those affected by the storm were influenced by accreditation-related constraints (in this case, from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) and concerns about the effects on funding streams (tuition revenue, state appropriations, and federal financial aid). The quantitative analysis examines how the decisions immediately following the storm affected student enrollment and persistence and the extent to which these effects vary by student-level risk factors or level of storm damage for the individual's household.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research also shows that the increased concern does not translate into an increase in actual intentions to engage in mitigation activities. This project applies principles of psychological distance/construal level theory to examine how messages about types of climate impacts/mitigation actions presented in psychologically proximate or distant terms can influence levels of concern, how different emotions elicited by these communications (e.g., fear or anger) may explain the observed response discrepancies with respect to political persuasion, and why there is a disparity between ""concern"" and ""intentions."" These research findings are very likely applicable to a variety of social issues.

The project focuses on three, key areas: 1) the types of scientific evidence used in litigation and how that evidence influences judicial decisions; 2) the factors that lead litigants to seek scientific information for use in the courtroom, as well as the factors that motivate scientists to provide that information; and 3) how uncertainties in environmental science are framed and addressed in legal disputes. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of how science is introduced, discussed, framed, and used in the judicial branch and, more broadly, in governmental policymaking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study about 400 lawsuits that have addressed environmental  matters between 1990 and 2018.

The study will link the defining factors of the cases (e.g., year, type of litigants, location, legal issue, scientific issue, and judicial decision) to the outcomes of interest.  Doing so will facilitate an investigation of how litigants and the courts are reacting to scientific advances and to efforts by scientists to communicate their work in more accessible ways to nonscientific audiences.  By linking the characteristics of the scientific evidence to the outcomes of cases, the research permits future litigants to better understand how scientific information can be more effectively incorporated in legal reasoning and argumentation.  In turn, courts' decisions may reflect a stronger link between science and legal reasoning.  Furthermore, the results of this research can be utilized by funding agencies to better support research in this area.

In order to make good predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as ""credit assignment"". There is presently limited understanding of how people attribute outcomes to their most likely causes in real-world environments. Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environment's causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (""model-based credit assignment""), rather than only attributing them to the most recently made choices (""model-free credit assignment""), as standard models posit.  Dr. Boorman's research will develop the first neurally-inspired theory of model-based credit assignment.  The insights from this basic science research have the potential to inform (1) theories about human cognition more broadly; (2) targeted education programs that leverages a better understanding of how learning works in the human brain; (3) mechanistic predictions for application to Artificial Intelligence research; and (4) principled investigations into potential biomarkers and treatment targets for psychiatric disorders such as  Schizophrenia and PTSD, with deficits that  include abnormal credit assignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate how the human brain attributes reinforcement outcomes to their likely causes, or ""credit assignment"".

While there have been many previous studies of the development of colonial economic systems, prior research has given less attention to the creative role of agrarian workers in developing economic systems. This project will provide an alternative perspective by clarifying how the decisions of agricultural workers impact the structure of emerging economies. These processes play out over long periods of time - frequently over centuries. Archaeology is ideal to understand changes that emerge over extended periods of time, and further, can provide important insight on the actions of populations that may not be recorded in archives. The project contributes to anthropological theory by developing a conceptual framework to evaluate agrarian labor regimes under colonialism. In doing so, the project engages with an emerging body of anthropological and archaeological literature that explores how global systems are created and shaped by non-elite actors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine how the agrarian laborers ultimately responsible for agricultural production engaged with the emerging markets through which the product of their labor was dispersed. The work will be conducted in the Cusco region of Peru, a critical nexus of agricultural production and economic development during the Andean Colonial Period (1532-1824 A.D). In Cusco, large quantities of agricultural goods were produced to supply markets in burgeoning mining towns. This production involved newly introduced products and foreign forms of labor organization that were central to the emergence of the colonial economy. The research team will employ a variety of archaeological methods to clarify how agrarian workers negotiated these shifting conditions over the course of the Colonial Period. By combining data from excavations with extant data from a lake core the research will assess shifting patterns of land use, environmental change, production, and consumption during this period of transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In certain locations, it seems that this process is due to a local shift and intensification in specific resources and technologies. In others, an outside influence, potentially through migration, can catalyze growth and change. Clear shifts in material culture can be identified in the archaeological record, but the reasoning behind them may not be quite as obvious. The archaeological site of Paquim, in Chihuahua, Mexico, is a site that underwent a dramatic fluorescence around 1200 A.D. The reasons for this change have been suggested to be an aggregation of local populations into the city center, or perhaps due to an influx of migrants from the southern civilizations in Mexico. Using ancient DNA studies, this research will contribute to understanding the role of migration in the Greater Southwest and specifically in the Casas Grandes area, which can be extended to other regions where migration potentially influenced the development of social complexity and worked as a catalyst for significant changes in established cultural fabrics. Outreach will include the introduction of methods related to the STEM sciences to K-12 students. Also, a summer program will allow for hands-on training for interested university students. A doctoral student will also be funded to aid in their degree completion. Migration is a fundamental human act.

In many domains, such as vaccination, resource conservation, or blood donation, the outcome that is optimal for the group cannot be achieved unless individuals act beyond their narrow self-interest.  The current research harnesses the principle of signaling to develop and test interventions that may inspire pro-social behavior by appealing to agents' desire to appear prosocial.  Whereas some people may be motivated to contribute to the public good simply by altruistic concerns for others, even absent those purely altruistic motives, nearly everyone likes to be viewed by others as a prosocial person or to think of themselves as prosocial.  In economic terms, this idea is captured by the concept of signaling -- engaging in a behavior that signals the type of person one is. Thus, a self-interested reason to engage in pro-social behavior is to signal (to oneself or to others) that one is a good person.   Five sets of experiments in the current project test the idea that prosocial behavior can be increased if people are given the opportunity to use that behavior to signal their prosocial nature.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed research the investigators test the effects of interventions designed based on signaling theory for their influence on prosocial behavior in a series of field and lab experiments. First, a field study in the context of a blood drive tests whether monetary incentives motivate blood donation more effectively when framed in a way that signals the pro-social motives of the decision maker to perform the behavior. Second, a study on framing messages to emphasize the signal value of vaccination examines whether parents of young children are more likely to receive an influenza vaccination for themselves after viewing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts their children first than after seeing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts self-care first, or after seeing either of two control messages. Third, in a study on peer recommendation, researchers will test whether a message advocating blood donation is more effective if it emphasizes the signal value of this behavior, and whether this signaling effect is more pronounced when the message comes in the form of a personalized recommendation from a co-worker as compared to a standard message from a blood drive. Fourth, three studies on social comparison will investigate whether feedback comparing one's performance to that of others promotes performance improvement in a pro-social task because the social comparison feedback serves as a signal, indicating what the performance says about the agent. Fifth, in a series of studies using a common pool resource game, researchers will explore the effect of a partitioning manipulation that signals the equitable amount for each agent to consume into order to achieve the group optimal outcome, and they will test whether the partition serves as a coordination signal. This research extends previous work in economics, social psychology, and decision research, and it applies signaling theory to the design of interventions to facilitate pro-social behavior. The body of research combines powerful field experiments with tightly controlled laboratory experimental designs to test the efficacy of signaling interventions by assessing actual behavior and examining the decision processes underlying these effects. The findings will simultaneously shed light on the nature of both pro-social behavior and signaling mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But whatever their goals, the foundations of such program are often shaky.

The PIs will investigate how changes in the dialysis industry affects firm strategies, Medicare costs, and patient outcomes. The project will use a very large data set to test hypothesis drawn from the economic theory of firm competition. The research has three distinct components. The first part focuses on how mergers and acquisitions affect firm strategy in this industry and the consequences for patient outcomes. The second component evaluates how regulations that affect the construction of new facilities influence market structure as well as patient outcomes. The third part analyzes a payment reform instituted by Medicare that reduced the incentives to over-prescribe injectable drugs, which again may have affected both Medicare's costs and patient's outcomes. Understanding the market for dialysis services is important for several reasons. Dialysis is an important component of health insurance costs; Medicare's annual total reimbursements for dialysis amount to about 1% of the entire federal budget. High quality dialysis care improves patients' lives. Finally, understanding how changes in competition and in Medicare policies have affected the dialysis market will give us new knowledge about how robust competition and sensible regulation and Medicare reimbursement policies may be able to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will use claims data from the entire universe of U.S. dialysis patients between 1998 and 2014; during this time period the industry became more concentrated. The projects funded by this award look at three different aspects of consolidation in the dialysis industry. The first studies how large dialysis chains have transferred their corporate strategies to the numerous independent facilities they acquired, which ultimately can affect the cost and quality of their treatments. The second develops a structural model of dialysis firms' entry, exit, and acquisition decisions to (i) understand how market structure and regulation affect dialysis care and (ii) estimate the impact of counterfactual policies, such as blocking mergers or relaxing Certificate of Need laws. The third examines how Medicare's reimbursement policies shape dialysis facilities' behavior, focusing specifically on a reform in 2011 that changed Medicare's reimbursement scheme for injectable drugs from a per-dose payment to a bundled payment. The team will use a novel instrumental variable strategy to provide the first causal evidence in the literature about whether the bundled payment policy resulted in lower drug doses, reduced costs and improved outcomes.

The project integrates disparate scholarly subfields as historians work with oceanographers to extend the instrumental meteorological record back two centuries and with a broader geographical distribution than is currently available. For safety, mariners recorded hazards to navigation on their charts, as well as weather data. The project extracts substantial meteorological data from historic logbooks, records heretofore inaccessible to modern scientists, and makes them freely available online. The investigators use these historic weather records to address current questions regarding shifts in wind and atmospheric pressure patterns. These include changes in high pressure systems that are related to the subtropical dry zones on land and the westerly storm tracks that steer the passage of rain-bearing weather systems. The understanding of past variability in these wind and atmospheric pressure patterns has societal relevance as these patterns directly impact agricultural productivity and can improve weather forecasting and modelling. Furthermore, the research can identify weather and navigational data that are of practical benefit to contemporary shipping, underscoring the project's importance to modern commercial navigation and maritime defense.

Research results will be made available to the public via informal learning opportunities at museums and to the broader scientific community at interdisciplinary conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term datasets are invaluable to meteorological research as they establish a baseline against which to measure recent changes, can validate models, and illuminate how the atmosphere and ocean interact. The historic logbooks being analyzed contain systematic weather observations (e.g., wind strength and direction, storms, sea state, precipitation, air temperature, atmospheric pressure) that will significantly extend the instrumental record. The newly-recovered historical data are combined with existing observational and reanalysis products to understand robustness and long-term context of variations in the Earth's atmospheric circulation over the past approximately 250 years. The investigators specifically consider: (a) changes in the Hadley circulation that are related to the expansion of subtropical dry zones, such as in the U.S. Southwest; and (b) changes in strength and position of subtropical high-pressure systems as manifestations of the descending limb of Hadley Cell circulation and changes in strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds that were traversed by the whalers on their way to historical whaling grounds and which have recently experienced strong poleward shifts. Understanding long-term variability in subtropical high-pressure systems and westerly storm tracks has relevance for any regions affected by such meteorological patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The content and structure of this particular REU provides both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating education and research. Specifically, our society can benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. Our program's focus is on training undergraduates to conduct trauma-related research to improve our understanding of PTSD. This REU site broadens the participation of under-represented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. This inclusion of veterans provides an opportunity for them to integrate to an undergraduate research culture in a safe environment with appropriate supports. Moreover, veteran participation in the design and implementation of trauma-related research with fellow veterans constitutes a novel application of ""participatory research"". Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants appreciate the value of conducting trauma-related research with direct input from members of the defined population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 8-10 students each year. The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 6-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions. Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the field, he will document how engineers conduct research to generate technical data about the region. In state and associational offices, he will follow the engineering data as they are communicated to bureaucrats and as bureaucrats deploy them for technical judgments and public decisions. Research methods will include participant observation, analysis of paper and digital documents, and semi-structured interviews. This approach will shed light on what technical and bureaucratic environmental information includes and what it excludes, such as the knowledge and perspectives of indigenous inhabitants of these environments.

This pressure is compounded by the fact that claims for reparations may occur simultaneously at international and national levels. The research supported by this award asks how international claims for redress converge on or diverge from national claims for redress from local governments.  With this dual focus, findings from this research can be used in the development of national government and international organization strategies for engaging with the increasing growth of claims for redress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University anthropology doctoral student, Anna Schirrer, supervised by Dr. David Scott, will carry out the research in Guyana. Guyana is an appropriate site for the research because there are active claims for redress at multiple levels that can be leveraged for research, and because the comparatively small size of the country makes the factors involved easier to isolate for a scientific study. Currently, there are two sorts of claims at stake. One claim, articulated by the multi-state Caribbean Community organization CARICOM, is a state-driven and internationally oriented claim for redress. The other, is a national rights-based claim for land addressed by local groups to the nation-state itself. Through twelve months of ethnographic research, the researcher will compare the legal resources, ethnic identity politics, and alliance networks used to legitimize authority in making redress claims. Data will be gathered through semi-structured interviews, ego-centered network mapping, and participant observation with a non-probability sample of experts at five different nodes in these networks. This research will contribute to social science theorization of the interactions between national and cross-national socio-legal processes.

While official reconciliation processes move forward, conflict may be pursued covertly as former adversaries jockey for position in post-war landscapes. The research supported by this award asks if this phenomenon is inevitable: is the persistence of antagonism an example of path dependency? Path dependency is the theory that the past lays down institutional, technological, and cognitive structures and patterns that act as constraints on future behaviors. But questions remain about how this happens, how  these constrained behaviors emerge, the feedback mechanisms that reinforce them, and the degree to which they can be interrupted and redirected. Post-conflict societies provide a unique opportunity to address these questions because efforts at social change, resistance to these efforts, and outcomes can be tracked in the micro-processes of daily life. Findings from this research will be important for theorists studying barriers to policy implementation and for policy makers who want their policies to succeed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by legal anthropologist, Dr. Robert Hayden (University of Pittsburgh). The researcher has identified post-conflict Bosnia-Herzegovina as an appropriate site to conduct the research.  After the civil war (1992-1995), the territory was divided constitutionally into regions, in each of which one of the three competing ethno-religious communities is dominant demographically although multiple communities are present. The basic science research question is whether there is evidence of path dependence in newly emerging intergroup relationships. The researcher will collect data on claims of heritage rights and the recreation of destroyed landscapes to test the hypothesis that reconstruction and replacement have been strategic rather than neutral and that they reinforce pre-war relationships rather than creating new ones. The researcher and his team will collect data on site destruction and rebuilding; quantitative measures of site importance and dominance, including centrality and size; and community interactions. They will employ a mixed-methods approach including archival research, analysis of official records, stakeholder interviews, and geo-spatial mappings. The primary focus will be historically antagonistic communities but the sample also will include a neutral control group. The research will support international research collaborations and opportunities for students. The results of the research will enrich social science theory of constraints on behavioral modifications in post-conflict contexts, and will serve interests of national security through better understanding of conflict persistence in multi-ethnic societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeologists have long sought to understand the nature of sociopolitical relations at Chaco Canyon, and between Chaco and its outlier communities. The evidence of sociopolitical hierarchy at Chaco itself is ambiguous, with few of the stamps of individual power seen at other power centers around the world, and archaeologists know even less about Chaco's 100+ outlier communities, of which only a handful have seen significant excavation. Michelle Turner of Binghamton University, under the guidance of Dr. Ruth Van Dyke, will examine the relationship between Chaco Canyon and Aztec Ruins, one of the largest Chacoan outlier communities, by establishing a chronology for the construction of the Aztec North great house. This research will be a basis for Turner's PhD dissertation, so this grant supports the work of a student. The researchers' project was developed in cooperation with archaeologists at Aztec Ruins National Monument, following consultation with tribal representatives, and it will provide valuable new information for the park's staff to share with visitors. The researchers will share their findings with tribal representatives and other members of descendant communities, and the results will also be disseminated at public talks in the region as well as in academic journals and at professional conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turner and Van Dyke conducted limited archaeological testing in 2016 at the previously unexcavated Aztec North great house, one of three great houses at Aztec Ruins National Monument. Aztec North's origins are hotly debated. While its neighbor great house Aztec West was clearly constructed with the involvement of Chacoan builders starting around 1110 CE, Aztec North's architecture includes an unusual combination of Chacoan and non-Chacoan construction features. For example, while the walls of the structure have a sandstone veneer that looks very much like Chacoan masonry, that veneer conceals an adobe fill core that looks more local. Was this structure built by newly arrived Chacoan builders who had not yet developed the work force to build a full masonry structure, or was it built by local people imitating Chacoan ways? Or was it perhaps a much later experiment in adobe construction? Turner will test these possibilities by running radiocarbon dating on organic materials from Aztec North to pinpoint the site's occupation dates. If Aztec North was built in the years just after construction of Aztec West, then it is probable that Chacoan builders were already present, while earlier dates would indicate it was most likely built by local people emulating Chaco. Dates after the mid-1100s would suggest a post-Chacoan origin. The radiocarbon dates, interpreted in combination with the researchers' analysis of the architecture, ceramics and other artifacts from the excavation, will provide valuable data for archaeologists seeking to understand the history of both Aztec Ruins and the wider Chacoan region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will do so first by conducting a comprehensive literature review to determine the kinds of the policies and practices that lead to ethical climates that prevent and remediate sexual harassment. They will then develop a self-assessment tool that will enable organizations to examine their ability to prevent and manage sexual harassment, and to evaluate if and how the self-assessment tool contributes to improved ethical infrastructures for preventing sexual harassment. Finally, they will develop a teaching module focused on sexual harassment for undergraduate and graduate students that will enhance ethical training and communication.

Discussions in this vein naturally turn to the circumstances in which social complexity was first established within various world regions, seeking to assess the degree to which violent conflict was foundational to the process. Archaeological study provides the most robust means of studying these long-ago developments, particularly through the analysis of large-scale features, such as encircling walls and moats, that significantly altered the local landscape. This project led by doctoral student Justin Bracken, will investigate the dynamics of construction of such early features built by the Maya of Peten, Guatemala in the Late Preclassic period (400/300 BC - AD 150). To do so, the project uses traditional archaeological excavation and mapping techniques alongside innovative GIS analyses and spatial theory, offering new approaches to the study of the built environment. The fieldwork component will employ several Guatemalan university students and local residents. This arrangement furthers their understanding of the archaeological past of their home region while offering them valuable fieldwork experience, increasing their employability on other projects. The final results will be published as a dissertation and in academic journals, and also presented at conferences in the United States and Guatemala. They will serve to pinpoint the specific role played by warfare in the rise of complex societies and offer a new angle of insight into the increasingly nuanced understanding of Preclassic Maya developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design of the project is centered on the following question: What roles did cooperation and conflict respectively play in the initial spread of state-level society? The question is investigated by weighing the relative contributions of cooperative behavior (numerous individuals working in concert on a common project) and conflict (the long-term investment in defense that the fortifications represent). This approach does not presuppose a hierarchical arrangement in which an elite class compelled the labor of commoners; instead, it allows for cooperative action as the driving factor. Further, it assesses the multiple effects and levels of significance of the features beyond fortification, analyzing their functions as hydrological controls, social boundaries, and delineators of ceremonial space. The small site of Muralla de Len, which rests upon a natural rise surrounded on three sides by water, provides the setting for the study. With a stone perimeter wall encircling it and a canal bisecting the widest point of access by land, the site appears oriented toward defense. Occupation at the site dates at least back to the Late Preclassic period and likely earlier, with the site layout established early in its history. Excavations into and adjacent to the perimeter wall and canal will aim to establish a firm chronology of construction of each, demonstrating their form through time and their impact upon the flow of water and movements of individuals, thereby defining their impact upon the local and regional social settings in the era of early social complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of the work has been performed with methods that have not enabled one to address what happens in the brain in the millisecond and millimeter space at the single-subject individual level. As a result, several key questions in the field of cognitive neuroscience have remained open for exploration. One of these key unknowns that we are addressing in our current proposal is the question of how brain regions specialized in processing emotional information interact with those areas of our brain that are engaged in perceiving the outer world. How does our perception get colored by our emotion? Our findings will enrich our understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion generation while also constraining the plausibility of certain emotion theories. Our research will not only promote the progress of emotion and cognitive neuroscience, but also it will advance our understanding of how the mechanisms of healthy interaction between emotional and perceptual system might be affected in neuropsychiatric disorders and as such the proposed research will have potential benefits to our national health, prosperity and welfare. Lastly, through educational outreach programs, we will also support education and diversity to benefit our society.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on the interface between emotion and visual perception in the human brain. Our proposed research aims to explore how stimulus-driven and cognitively-modulated emotional processes affect our visual perception of faces. To reach the overarching goal of the proposed plan, we will adopt a multimodal approach to measure neuronal population activity with intracranial electrodes and probe their causal importance by perturbing their activity using direct cortical stimulation.  In addition to intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS), we will measure subjective report, behavior, and pupillary activity. Our research involves human subjects undergoing invasive monitoring for several days as part of clinical evaluation for refractory focal epilepsy. Stimulus-driven emotions are generated by biologically entrenched perceptions that may not be necessarily accessible to conscious awareness; as such, stimulus-driven emotions are associated with prototypical responses that quickly prepare for action.  Emotional faces, such as those expressing anger and joy/happiness, are used to elicit stimulus-driven emotions.  In contrast, cognitively-modulated emotions are generated through cognitive processes such as contextual information that lead to cognitive appraisal of how a stimulus relates to one's motivations, rather than a specific perceptual stimulus per se.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current archaeological evidence indicates that humans migrated from northeastern Asia into North America and spread throughout the rest of the Americas.  As part of this research theme, archaeologists are interested in learning about the timing and route that humans initially took to migrate into the Americas.  One main hypothesis on this theme asserts that people used a hunting-gathering-fishing lifeway to spread from northeastern Asia into North America and beyond by initially traveling along the Pacific coastline around the glaciated margins of Alaska and Canada.  If this is true, archaeologists expect that early coastal sites should contain artifacts and the remains of animals that reveal the application of effective technologies used to extract a living from a broad range of marine environmental resources.  Finding archaeological sites that show early North Americans peoples possessed a full mastery of marine environments would add confirmatory evidence to support the Pacific coastal migration hypothesis. The team will generate and share interdisciplinary knowledge about the history of changing coastal environments on Cedros Island and how humans lived in a changing coastal context.

This island is special because it retains many well preserved archaeological sites clustered around ancient freshwater springs that were undoubtedly attractive places for early peoples to repeatedly settle and in the process create a record of their lives that accumulated over hundreds to thousands of years.  The researchers will lead a team of archaeologists, geoarchaeologists, and environmental scientists to conduct excavations at four sites that are known to contain artifacts and marine animal remains that date earlier than 12,000 calendar years old.

Opioid addiction has become a global problem, having reached epidemic proportions in many countries.  Governments have responded with myriad policies and programs to reduce the impact of opioid use, on society and on the lives of low-income populations. Unfortunately, sometimes the result is policies that are inconsistent in their messaging and contradictory in their effects. For example, low-income opioid users may continue to face harsh criminal laws even as their access to free and subsidized social services and treatment increases. Therefore, it is important to understand how low-income opioid users experience and negotiate these contradictions in order to further national efforts to craft innovative and effective policies to address this growing social issue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Brown University anthropology doctoral student, Parsa Bastani, with the oversight of Dr. Katherine A. Mason. The researcher will use Iran as a case study. Iran is an appropriate site to examine how contradictory policies are experienced because the country has laws that subject illicit substance users to both state-mandated care and surveillance, control, and punishment. This laws have included subjecting anyone who even appears to be an illicit drug user in public spaces to criminal prosecution, even if not in possession of drugs at the time of arrest. Recently, the government amended the laws to mandate that police-apprehended substance users undergo mandatory detoxification while detained in specialized carceral centers followed by aftercare in reintegration-oriented harm reduction and rehabilitation facilities. The researcher will undertake twelve months of ethnographic research to investigate how low-income opioid users experience and respond to being simultaneously criminalized and cared for by the state. He will collect data through semi-structured interviews, participant-observation, and document analysis, to examine: 1) Experiences of criminalization: how do low-income substance users encounter and navigate the criminal justice system? 2) Experiences of care: what impact does care infrastructure have on low-income substance users' experiences with social marginalization? 3) Experiences of addiction: What are low income substance users' moral dispositions toward their drug usage? What do they make of competing moral discourses about addiction? Findings from this research will contribute to understanding the actual effects of laws about illegal opioid use and the factors that enable and hinder the reintegration of highly stigmatized populations into society.

In recent decades, however, USA STEM research productivity has plateaued despite increases in federal research funding, leading to questions of how to maximize productivity in the STEM academic research workforce beyond financial means. The objective of this project is to investigate the role of motivation in STEM higher education faculty research productivity and development. Motivated faculty are expected to be more productive and stay in the higher education workforce, particularly if they are from populations traditionally underrepresented in the STEM research workforce. Results of the current project will inform higher education institutions, particularly universities striving to increase scholarly productivity, as to specific strengths and deficits in STEM faculty motivation that relate to measurable gains in research productivity. This is a critical step toward designing research development interventions from university-based induction programs to NSF training grants aimed at bolstering motivation to enhance the productivity of STEM faculty researchers. Findings will provide guidance to universities on best practices and policies for supporting STEM faculty in producing innovative basic and applied scientific knowledge, tackling key social and economic challenges with their research, and training the next generation of flexible, knowledgeable, and diverse STEM researchers. This project is jointly funded by the Science of Science Innovation and Policy Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-institution project will be the first to pair STEM faculty psychological surveys responses with bibliometric indicators of research productivity (publications, citations, social media attention). These data will be used to test a conceptual model hypothesizing how faculty characteristics (demographic, employment) and institutional qualities (research resources, social-environmental factors) relate to motivational variables (autonomy, competence, relatedness, interest, control, value, self-regulation, grit) that, if supported, should yield optimal intrinsic motivation and positive emotions, and result in enhanced research productivity (e.g., bibliometric, self-report). Structural equation modeling will be used to analyze the posited relationships cross-sectionally and predict the development of STEM faculty researchers longitudinally over a three-year period. Additionally, the project will examine hypothesized relationships among traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields based on gender, race, and ethnicity. This research will improve our understanding of the STEM higher education research workforce in several ways. First, this project represents the first interdisciplinary study pairing faculty survey data with independent, bibliometric indicators of research productivity. Second, these studies will utilize reliable and valid measures of variables relating to faculty research outcomes and evaluate the generalizability of the hypothesized model in a large USA sample of ~1,400 faculty across 10 higher education institutions. Third, this research will expand upon limited empirical findings investigating psychological variables associated with faculty research productivity and development, and explore the interplay with faculty characteristics (e.g., underrepresented minority groups in STEM) and institutional qualities. Fourth, the project will utilize established motivation theories rarely applied to faculty research productivity and development to generate new knowledge and best practices in this under-examined domain. As such, the current project will guide the establishment of critical variables and benchmarks for STEM faculty motivation to predict research productivity and development over time. This project is jointly funded by the Science of Science Innovation and Policy Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. The Upper Gila Preservation Archaeology Field School, located in rural southwestern New Mexico, provides hands-on training in ethically responsible and scientifically rigorous archaeological methods in the context of a long-term research project. Training is conducted within a Preservation Archaeology ethos, a philosophy integrating big-picture research, use of existing collections, focused fieldwork, site preservation, and local community outreach. Under the close supervision of a team of experienced instructors, this program offers undergraduate students an immersive environment in which to learn the fundamentals of archaeological field and laboratory work and how to link their work to broader anthropological issues that have contemporary relevance. Specifically, students are trained in excavation and survey techniques, experimental archaeology, artifact processing and analysis, report-writing, and public presentation. Based on the premise that sites are non-renewable resources, the Preservation Archaeology Field School is training the next generation of academic, private sector, and government agency archaeologists. This project attracts exceptional students from a variety of cultural and economic backgrounds. Student recruiting targets underrepresented groups, including Native American, Hispanic, and community/small college undergraduates with limited STEM opportunities, as well as students from major academic institutions to increase the diversity of views represented in the discipline. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Student efforts contribute directly to Archaeology Southwest's long term research program focused on the Salado Phenomenon in the southern U.S. Southwest during the late pre-contact period (A.D. 1200-1450).

This project will address the technical challenges that researchers and decision makers face when designing and conducting field measurement to determine soil contamination levels, and it will improve existing analytical methods currently used for environmental contamination incidents.  Project findings will enhance mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of contaminants on human and environmental health. Monitoring radioactivity levels in soils is particularly important because elevated radioactivity can affect human health through external exposure and through ingestion of agricultural products or livestock products.  By assessing the radioactivity levels in soils in the context of background topography and physical processes, this project will enhance the understanding of radionuclide behavior in landscapes.  Such enhanced understanding will help policy makers make informed decisions about remediation and safety measures in the event of a contamination incident.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delineating distribution patterns of contaminants from a limited number of soil samples poses challenges, especially in mountainous terrain with mixed land-use types such as is the case in Fukushima Prefecture in Japan, where forests, farm fields, and residential areas were contaminated by the radioactive fallout following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident precipitated by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  The doctoral student will focus her attention on radiocesium, which becomes attached to clay soil particles (colloids) and becomes immobile.  These colloids can gradually move downward in soils or are redistributed through surface runoff, erosion, and deposition.  These characteristics raise two principal questions:  (1) Do the soil samples collected at certain points reflect the influence of topography and physical processes?  (2) Does the collected data represent an accurate picture of the contaminant distribution patterns and their changes?  In the past, analysis of the spatial distribution of contaminants used correlation and clustering techniques or other analytic methods like semivariograms and kriging.  Because the use those types of approaches were not satisfactory for sites like those in Fukushima, the doctoral student will use stepwise multi-spatial scale analysis that considers horizontal, diagonal, vertical, and temporal soil distributions.  The multi-spatial scale analysis then will be combined with terrain structure analysis.  The structure of terrain includessoil collection points, hillslopes, flow paths, and watershed patterns.  By combining this terrain analysis with numerical or distance-based analysis at different scales, this project will employ a more sophisticated spatial analysis approach for mountainous landscapes.  Although this project will focus on methods developed for the Fukushima area, this approach will have utility at other sites, including locales in the U.S., where background factors might affect radioactivity levels resulting from accidental dispersing of radioactive materials at various spatial scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The FW-HTF cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. This award fulfills part of that aim. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;K-12 STEM teachers are critical to the US economy. With investments in teaching quality representing enormous economic value, the quality of education has been identified as a significant determinant of gross domestic product economic growth. However, the US teacher workforce is experiencing a crisis: teacher demand exceeds supply at every level, and attrition is extraordinarily high for new teachers.  Further, while STEM teaching represents one of the areas of highest need, STEM teachers leave the profession at high rates. These developments call for innovative workforce augmentation technologies to improve K-12 STEM teachers' performance and quality of work-life. To address this critical national need, the project will investigate how intelligent cognitive assistants for teachers can transform teacher work to significantly increase teacher performance and teacher quality of work-life. The project centers on the design, development, and evaluation of the Intelligent Augmented Cognition for Teaching (I-ACT) framework for intelligent cognitive assistants for teachers. With a focus on assisting K-12 STEM teachers in technology-rich inquiry teaching that supports collaborative, problem-based STEM learning, I-ACT cognitive assistants provide teachers with (1) prospective pedagogical guidance (preparation support preceding classroom teaching), (2) concurrent pedagogical guidance (real-time support during classroom teaching), and (3) retrospective pedagogical guidance (reflection support within a community of practice following classroom teaching). The project will culminate with an experiment conducted with a fully implemented version of I-ACT in public middle schools in North Carolina and Indiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project realizes its objective through two primary thrusts. First, the research team will design and develop I-ACT cognitive assistants for K-12 STEM teachers and test them in public school classrooms. Utilizing AI-based multimodal learning analytics and a social constructivist theory of pedagogy, I-ACT cognitive assistants use machine-learned models of teacher orchestration to provide guidance throughout the full teaching workflow. I-ACT cognitive assistants operate in a tight feedback loop in which collected data will drive successive iterations of machine learning to train refined teacher support models for improved I-ACT cognitive assistant functionalities. Second, the research team will investigate how I-ACT cognitive assistants improve K-12 STEM teacher performance and teacher quality of work-life. The team will conduct focus groups, case studies, semi-structured interviews, and observations of teachers using I-ACT cognitive assistants in school implementations with middle school science teachers at the project's partner schools. The team will also conduct quasi-experimental studies to determine I-ACT impact on teacher performance and quality of work-life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Luke,,Pangle,lpangle@gsu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,08/15/2019,01/31/2024,399992.00,"This project investigates how the water cycle within urban watersheds is altered by exchanges of water between the landscape and human infrastructure. The project demonstrates a new framework for analyzing urban water budgets that synergistically integrates qualitative analysis of knowledge, perceptions, and governance of water resources and infrastructures. This research will generate important new knowledge about how infrastructure-mediated flows (IMFs), including inter-basin transfers (IBTs) and the infiltration and inflow (I&amp;I) of rainfall and groundwater into sanitary sewer pipes, fundamentally alter the hydrology of watersheds. The research will reveal how these IMFs strain the capacity of wastewater treatment systems and evaluate how this new knowledge can enhance the effective governance of transboundary water resources. The broader societal impacts of this research include enhancing STEM education and the inclusion of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The project also includes a summer workshop with local K-12 teachers aimed at integrating concepts of urban hydrology and water governance into curriculum. The project provides research training for undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia State University, a national leader in supporting the educational accomplishments of underrepresented minority students, and elements of the project will be integrated into the curriculum for undergraduate and graduate courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. population is becoming increasingly urbanized, resulting in dramatic impacts on urban watersheds and contributing to multiscalar and transboundary water governance challenges. Water withdrawals for municipal consumption have increased greatly, often necessitating politically contentious inter-basin transfers of water. Aging water infrastructure is conducive to infiltration and inflow, whereby a high volume of water permeates sanitary-sewers through pipe fractures and discontinuities. This unnecessarily increases inflow to wastewater treatment plants, while reducing streamflow in local watersheds. Inter-basin transfers and infiltration and inflow remain difficult to quantify, resulting in disparate perceptions of their magnitude and importance. This project answers three fundamental questions about the magnitude, variability, and governance of infrastructure-mediated flows (IMFs) in urban watersheds: (1) how do IMFs impact urban watershed hydrology; (2) how are these impacts perceived and managed by governance authorities and stakeholders; and (3) how will governance decisions be impacted by improved hydrologic characterization of IMFs? The methodology includes a novel formulation of the urban water budget with explicit quantification of the impact of inter-basin transfers and infiltration and inflow. A possible solution is using data representing meteorological variables, potable water flows, sanitary sewer flows, and land-cover characteristics. These data are widely available and promote maximum transferability of the approach. The solution of the urban water budget will be informed by qualitative data gathered from utility managers and water resource stakeholders, thereby leveraging local expertise. The perceptions of IMFs, and responses to new knowledge about them, will be characterized through an iterative set of interviews with managers and stakeholders. Inferences will be made via qualitative-thematic analysis of interview transcripts and quantitative analysis of Likert-scale survey responses. The findings of this project will inform conceptualizations about urban water management and urban sustainability. To demonstrate the utility of this new method and approach, this study focuses on the South River Watershed within the broader Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, while the methodological approach and results are applicable across a broad array of urban watershed in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of isotopes preserved in human skeletal remains provide a valuable means to identify the geographic origins of individuals or groups buried in archeological contexts suggesting warfare, offering evidence that can corroborate other archaeological and biological indicators (fortifications, village destruction, traumatic skeletal injury, etc.). Even so, refinement of isotopic methods is required to improve the confidence of results. Lead (Pb) is a toxic trace metal that affects the health of biological organisms, but its composition can also indicate from where an individual originates. Pb isotopes preserved in human tooth enamel provide a signature, via food chain pathways, of the geographic area in which that individual was born and grew up. This study will establish and demonstrate a new method for biological sourcing, the biological available Pb method, which compares the Pb isotopes of prehistoric human and non-migratory animal populations to determine if humans found in the archaeological record of one area are local or actually came from another region. This will aid researchers who commonly question whether particular burials or mortuary treatments, such as isolated skulls and mandibles, reflect special burial treatment of honored ancestors or the disposal of dismembered enemies from other regions. This study will test if late prehistoric Caddo communities in southwest Arkansas were committing large-scale acts of violence against neighboring regions. Concurrent archeological evidence of increased violence in the Southern Plains and the Eastern Woodlands may reflect increasing tensions between regions. Alternatively, unusual burial treatments often attributed to warfare might indicate alternative practices involving transport of partial skeletal remains for special burial at important regional centers. This study also serves the practical purpose of determining cultural affiliation for the purposes of Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act compliance and to inform and encourage feedback from descendant communities including the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. The study also has practical forensic applications for determining points of geographic origin for human skeletal material recovered from multiple present day/recent contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Samuelsen, under the supervision of Dr. George Sabo III, will employ Pb and strontium (Sr) isotope analysis to evaluate early lifetime locations for the remains of 352 individuals represented in a skull-and-mandible cemetery (A.D. 1253-1399) at the Crenshaw site in southwest Arkansas, as part of his dissertation research. This will be accomplished through the creation of a comparative multi-state map of biologically available Pb/Sr isotopic ratios from states surrounding Arkansas. This map will be compared to Pb/Sr isotopic ratios from the human and animal remains from Crenshaw and other southwest Arkansas sites. High resolution Pb and Sr isotopes will be obtained using a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Arkansas. The resulting data, whether indicating local or foreign origin, will illustrate how biological Pb isotopes can be analyzed, how they can reveal the purpose behind specialized burial treatments, and demonstrate how isotopes like Pb and Sr can help evaluate the prevalence and extent of many ancient cultural practices including interregional warfare and specialized mortuary practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The third is autonomous passenger vehicles. These technologies are interdependent in many ways, and understanding the likely effects of these technologies requires answers to many different questions. How should tolls be set? How should carpools be created? How much should carpooling passengers pay for the ride? How should the tolls paid depend on the number of passengers in a car?

Understanding the nature of spatial inequality dynamics is vital to both basic social science and to public policy, yet existing methods and models provide incomplete views of these spatial dynamics.  While a central focus of inequality research has been on the evolution of the aggregate income distribution, much less attention has been directed at the spatial pattern of inequality and pattern dynamics.  Spatial inequalities can have important implications for social cohesion, economic growth, and the design of policies targeted at reducing the level of inequality.  The advances produced in the project will have wide applicability.  In addition to spatial income inequality dynamics, many other social and economic phenomena have distributions that evolve in space and time.  Software packages will be delivered as open-source projects and accompanied with extensive tutorials and documentation to facilitate broad dissemination across the social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop new analytical methods for the study of spatial dynamics of income inequality; specifically, new approaches will be developed to measuring changes in the distributional characteristics of those dynamics that incorporate their spatial dependence and heterogeneity.  The new approaches will include both global measures that report summary properties of the spatial dynamics as well as local indicators that can be used to identify hot-spots of locations that are important drivers of the overall dynamics or are outliers from the global trends.  Analytical and simulation based evaluations of the statistical properties of the new measures will be conducted, and empirical applications involving regional income inequalities will be carried out.  These new analytics will be incorporated into enhanced versions of two open-source spatial analysis packages: Python Spatial Analysis Library and Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems.  The former provides social scientists who wish to develop custom applications with access to a modular library that can be used in conjunction with existing software to enable the new space-time analytics.

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ?black box'. This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At 3.0 Ma, multiple species of Australopithecus are represented in the fossil record across eastern and southern Africa. By 2.5 Ma, Australopithecus mostly died out, and in its place evolved two separate lineages with very different adaptations to the environment. One lineage is our own, Homo, characterized by a pattern of increased brain size and dependence on material culture that has persisted over the last several million years. The other lineage, Paranthropus, lasted over 1 million years, and was represented by three species with unique dental and facial adaptations for potentially eating tough or hard foods. Despite the obvious importance of this interval, it is poorly represented in the fossil record and few fossil specimens have been found that can shed light on the causes and patterns of the origins of these lineages. The Ledi-Geraru Research Project works in a fossiliferous region that includes this important time interval and aims to illuminate the issues relevant to the extinction of Australopithecus and the emergence of Homo and Paranthropus. The investigators will use the results of this work in public science outreach about the hominin lineage, including the critical relationship between environmental variance and hominin adaptations. The project also will foster international collaborations and student training. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the last decade, the investigators have identified fossiliferous sediments in the Afar region of Ethiopia that range from 2.9 to 2.4 Ma before present. Finds from these sediments include a 2.8 million year old mandible that is the earliest known representative of the genus Homo, and additional fossils suggesting that there were multiple hominin species existing at roughly the same time in the region. In addition, several localities in the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area show evidence that hominins were using stone tools to gain access to animal tissues and resources. Continued paleoanthropological research will be conducted at Ledi-Geraru Project sites to recover additional fossil and archaeological materials and better understand relationships between hominin behaviors and environmental contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some worry about threats to the nation's democracy while others are concerned that the U.S. president is unfairly targeted by the media and ""witch hunt"" investigations. What do Americans make of all this and how do they want to go forward? The American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys are an essential tool for answering such questions. Understanding the preferences of its citizens is the hallmark of a healthy, functioning democracy, and since 1948 the ANES has been the gold standard for measuring the opinions of the public and a leading resource in understanding voting behavior in the United States. The upcoming presidential election in 2020 is shaping up to be a defining moment in American history. Trust in democratic institutions has been declining at an alarming rate among the American public. Challenges, as well as defenses, of those institutions are coming from many directions. New and existing questions on the ANES survey will allow researchers to understand the sources of growing American discontent, explain misunderstandings between elected officials the public, and identify opportunities for bridging the country?s political and social divisions in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the preferences of citizens is the hallmark of a healthy, functioning democracy, and the American National Election Studies (ANES) time series has been the gold standard for gauging and assessing the connection between public opinion and voting behavior in the U.S.  We propose to conduct the 2020 face-to-face ANES surveys, the most comprehensive and careful study of how Americans evaluate their government, form opinions about major issues of the day, participate in politics, and choose which candidates to support, and thereby extend a time series that dates back to 1948. Specifically, we propose to collect data in 2020 on a national probability sample of respondents in two waves of in-person interviews (before and after the election). The content and design of these surveys will be informed by two major pilot surveys and a number of small-scale pilots. In an era where response rates for phone surveys have dipped below 10 percent and where most online surveys still face daunting issues with respect to representativeness, the ANES survey offers reliable measurement of social, economic, and political attitudes in the context of American elections. The negativity and polarization of our political environment make the need for non-partisan, scientifically-valid survey research more pressing than ever. This is what ANES offers, while also providing unparalleled time series data that puts the nature of our current politics into appropriate historical context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

David,C,Somers,somers@bu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2018,08/31/2023,591061.00,"Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans experience the world via multiple sensory modalities --  we see, we hear, and we touch. Each sensory modality has unique strengths and weaknesses in its ability to represent the world around us. Our minds are able to flexibly recruit visual or auditory brain structures when their strengths correspond to the task at hand. In addition, our experience at any moment depends both on sensory input and on working memory and attention mechanisms in the brain. These mechanisms have very limited capacities, which in turn limit cognition. The overarching goal of this project is to examine the human brain mechanisms that support attention and working memory in vision, hearing, and touch. The research team will perform functional MRI experiments to study the brain activity of healthy adults while they perform demanding sensory working memory tasks. Preliminary studies by the research group suggest that there are extensive brain networks, extending into the frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex, that are specialized for each sensory modality, as well as a shared network that supports and unifies these three senses. The current research program will examine individual differences in working memory performance and brain network organization. It will also develop advanced computational models that can predict the functional organization of an individual's brain from their unique pattern or 'fingerprint' of brain connectivity. The project will facilitate other research efforts through the dissemination of new models and computational tools, and will recruit and train young scientists, including members of groups that are under-represented in STEM, in cognitive neuroscience research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has 4 primary intellectual goals: (1) identify the fine-scale organization of tactile, visual, auditory, and modality-independent attention &amp; working memory (WM) regions within human cerebral cortex; (2) reveal the specificity of coding of WM information across cortical regions for each modality; (3) detail the network organization of attention &amp; WM circuits; and (4) test hypotheses about content-specific WM mechanisms and cross-modality WM coding. Individual subject fMRI analyses permit fine-scale observation of distinct functional regions. Drawing on subject-specific maps of cortical organization, the research group will re-examine the highly debated question of which brain structures support stimulus-specific working memory for each modality. It will investigate the specificity of sensory modality biased regions by examining functional networks in the resting-state within individual participants. The research team will leverage its findings to probe these networks in 1200 subjects from the Human Connectome Project dataset. The research group will also test and validate a machine-learning approach, Connectome Fingerprinting, for predicting the location of modality-specific working memory regions in individual brains from their unique functional connectome. Vision excels in coding spatial information, but codes timing less reliably; conversely, the auditory system performs high-fidelity temporal coding but coarse spatial coding. The research team has observed cross-modal recoding of WM information into cortical structures that prefer the 'appropriate modality' - auditory spatial WM recruits visual-biased regions and visual temporal WM recruits auditory-biased regions. To probe content-specific WM mechanisms, the researchers will examine interactions between sensory modality WM and space/time WM. The research group hypothesizes that visual and spatial WM stores are distinct, but that auditory and timing WM stores are shared. Collectively, these studies will elucidate the human brain networks and mechanisms that support sensory working memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Are animals also able to use mental imagery to represent their world and experiences? Previous NSF-funded research from the principal investigator has found evidence that rats form mental images of expected absent events. The proposed research builds on this by asking how can rats use mental imagery to reason, and how do imagined events impact new learning? Many creatures face situations in the real world in which the ability to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty would be adaptive. This work can provide insights into how brains think, and how the human mind is unique versus how it is similar to the minds of other animals. This research could inform the design of artificial intelligence systems to learn and make decisions under conditions of incomplete information. Broader educational impacts include the involvement of high-school and college students as research interns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans are rational, causal agents. Blaisdell and his colleagues have recently discovered that, like humans, rats engage in a variety of rational processes involving causality. They make rational causal inferences from their interventions and represent unobservable events, such as a hidden cause, as possibly being present when presented with associated events. That is, they appear to have some form of mental imagery. Rational decision making guided by mental imagery involves the recruitment of the same neural circuits (i.e., the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) that are involved in human reasoning under ambiguous situations, and that requires pattern completion from partial information. This proposal investigates the theoretical and empirical foundations of rational decision making that are integral to human reasoning and their evolutionary antecedents and progenitors by seeking for commonalities in a phylogenetically-distant mammalian relative. Behavioral experiments use operant and Pavlovian conditioning procedures to establish associations between events. Tests of decision making will be made by presenting one of the events and observing behavior when the associated event is uncovered and therefore explicitly absent, or covered by an opaque shield and therefore ambiguously absent. This research will deepen our understanding of the mental capacities of mammalian animals which may offer insights into the likely brain mechanisms involved in reasoning. Mental imagery is a basic process in human learning and memory. Establishing evidence for mental imagery in animal learning and memory can provide insights into which aspects of human cognition are unique to humans, and which aspects of human cognition are homologies shared with nonhuman animals, and could inform the design of artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing agricultural production through irrigation is an essential part of the complex solution to global hunger.  Irrigation can make marginal land suitable for agriculture and existing croplands more productive. However, irrigation is limited by its massive use of water.  Determining the potential of irrigation to reduce global hunger requires a thorough understanding of multiple factors such as climate, agricultural water supply, and crop production.  This project will improve predictions of climate impacts on irrigated croplands by advancing the understanding of key constraints on irrigated agricultural productivity. As a result, it will develop strategies for enhancing future irrigation management.  Knowledge, data, and models will be widely disseminated both directly and through collaborations with the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and Kansas Geological Survey.  This project will also increase knowledge of physical geography, climate science, numerical modeling, and data analysis for students at critical STEM stages.  Additionally, the investigator will create a teaching model that enables high-school students to explore the impacts of climate and water resources on crop production, develop an educator professional development course for the teaching model, and provide research experiences for diverse graduate and undergraduate students intending to major in a STEM field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Irrigated agricultural projections that directly simulate the impacts of water supply on yield are few, and typically have simplistic representations of crop growth and irrigation.  This project will address this key deficiency through four main efforts: (1) Construct a modeling framework that connects climate and hydrologic data with a crop model capable of simulating limited automatic irrigation; (2) Evaluate and improve the modeling framework using reported yields and satellite-derived evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and vegetation index data; (3) Force the modeling framework with climate and water supply scenarios; and (4) Explore crop water use and production across irrigation scenarios and modeling assumptions.  These efforts will provide answers to three important questions at the interface of climate, water, and agriculture: (1) What are the effects of water supply shortages on irrigated agricultural production?currently and in the future?  (2) Which irrigation management practices can reduce water use without harming yields, and ultimately decrease the impacts of water scarcity on irrigated crop production?  (3) How can satellite data improve crop model simulations of irrigated agricultural production?

A gene called EPAS1 illustrates that complex relationship by modifying the expression of hundreds of target genes that cause biological responses to maintain oxygen homeostasis when oxygen supplies are low at high-altitude or relatively low after high-oxygen therapy.  Healthy people with a dampened response to high-altitude, reflected by an absence of the typical increase in hemoglobin concentration at high altitudes, provide a natural laboratory for discovery.  In addition to explaining the different ways to adapt successfully to low oxygen environments, this special case may improve understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships under other conditions.  Examples include inappropriately engaging oxygen homeostasis pathways by premature infants, people with wounds that will not heal, and fighter pilots who are all exposed for hours or days to extremely high oxygen levels and are at risk of pathologies including blindness upon return to normal oxygen levels.  Learning the balance of healthy levels of gene products and their associated physiological traits in the study population can provide a model for designing successful clinical interventions.  This project will also support international research collaborations, community science outreach, and undergraduate student training and mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between genetic, phenotypic and reproductive variation is central to the goal of understanding the sources of human biological variation.

To better understand how human migration influences cultural change and its consequences, researchers have increasingly turned to the archaeological record where known prehistoric migrations were important in forming contemporary societies. The main goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the catalysts, timing, nature, and consequences of one of the largest human migration events in prehistory - the expansion of Bantu-speaking farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa some 5,000 to 2,000 years ago. To investigate this poorly understood event, this research will focus on excavating Nangara-Komba Rock Shelter in the Central African Republic which spans the critical time period before and after the Bantu expansion. Information generated from this project will speak to broader issues about why populations migrate and the impact incoming populations with new technologies have on indigenous peoples and environments. This collaborative research project brings together researchers from the Central African Republic, a country underrepresented in the sciences, and the United States. The inclusion of American and Central African students in the research supports scholarly and cultural exchange. The project will build intellectual capacity for Central African graduate students who will receive training in archaeological methods that is unavailable in their country. Public outreach activities such as radio interviews, public lectures, blogs and digital media in Central Africa and the US will disseminate the findings and implications of this project to different audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion of Bantu-speaking farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa is widely recognized as having a significant and lasting impact on language, culture, demography and technology, as well as the trajectories of contemporary African peoples. Despite its importance, very little is known about the environmental catalysts, exact timing, nature and consequences of this event. Nangara-Komba Rock Shelter is one of the oldest rock shelters in this part of Central Africa with prehistoric occupations spanning from 5,600 years ago into the nineteenth century. Importantly, the site lies in the Sangha River Interval believed by many as an important natural corridor for Bantu migrations into Central African forests. Excavations  in the shelter will yield organic materials that can be used to construct an exact chronology of the site and date when ceramic and iron artifacts associated with Bantu-speaking populations appear. Analysis of artifacts and organic materials will provide crucial information on the lifeways of pre-Bantu indigenous hunter-gatherers and early Bantu-speakers. Comparative analyses of these materials over time will provide information on changes in prehistoric lifeways associated with the expansion of Bantu peoples. Geochemical analyses of sediment from the site and adjacent areas will be used to reconstruct vegetation and climate changes spanning the period before and after the migration. Cumulatively, information from this project will significantly enhance current understanding of migration and Central African prehistory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, despite a long history of subsidizing energy technologies such as renewable electricity sources, biofuels, and efficient lighting and appliances, the analytical basis for evaluating the effects of subsidies on these technologies is not yet firmly established. Prior assessments of energy technology subsidies employed one of two analytical perspectives; the analysis either:  (i) compared subsidy costs to the monetized environmental benefits resulting from increased consumer adoption of the technology, but ignored the subsidy's impact on technology evolution; or (ii) examined the subsidy's impact on the market competitiveness of technology producers, including future technology innovations, but ignored the environmental benefits.  Both perspectives contribute valuable insights, but neither perspective fully accounts for the range of subsidy costs and benefits, and policy prescriptions based on either perspective in isolation are necessarily limited.  By combining the two analytical perspectives within a single integrated framework, this project will allow us to estimate and compare the long-run net effects of alternative forms of technology subsidies on consumer adoption, producer innovation, and the resultant benefits.  The research will apply the framework to estimate the net effects of different subsidy trajectories (types, levels, and timing of subsidies) for particular emerging technologies -- including electric cars, solar photovoltaics, and wind power. The results will advance understanding of environmental policy, technology innovation policy, and quantitative policy analysis.  The major product of this research, the integrated analytical framework, can be used to inform policy decisions about which technologies to subsidize, the level and timing of subsidy support, and other policy-relevant questions.  The framework is flexible:  it is immediately applicable to the analysis of subsidies for new technologies in other industries, and could also be extended to study forms of intervention other than subsidies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated framework comprises three types of models. An adoption model, using actual price and technology sales data, forecasts consumer adoption of the technology as a function of the consumer's subsidy-adjusted investment in the technology.  A technological progress model, based on experience-curve methods and actual cost/experience data for comparable technologies, forecasts technology cost reductions that result from accumulated consumer adoption of the technology, and isolates the cost reductions attributable to the subsidy. An emissions model, using data developed by the environmental economics and life-cycle emissions research communities, converts units of technology adoption into estimates of emissions reduction, and converts estimated emissions reductions into estimates of monetized social benefit. The integration of these models produces estimates of the time-discounted net effects of a technology subsidy that account for the subsidy cost in relation to: (i) the direct environmental benefits (monetized emissions reductions) from consumer adoption of the technology, and (ii) the indirect innovation-related benefits derived from technical improvements, stimulated by the subsidy, that yield additional consumer adoption and benefits in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interpretations of Mesopotamian society, heavily influenced by the written record, have often interpreted the earlier level where the archaeological record is dominated by public buildings, as a very top down society, with some suggesting that much of the population were comparable to chattle slaves.

Such techniques make these decisions using patterns learned from historical social data. Emphasis on prediction rather than the circumstances of dataset creation have led to machine learning systems that preferentially target vulnerable populations for disparately adverse social judgments while making it more difficult for those subject to these decisions to protest unfair treatment. This study explores the limitations of such machine learning systems by tracing how technical and non-technical people, including funding agencies, have historically understood what machine learning systems could and should achieve. Particular care is given to the forms of ""learning"" valued by researchers during different moments in the 20th century, and to the emergence of theoretical concepts that were constrained and even defined by the capabilities of the available material devices. This work makes visible the efforts of women and men previously omitted in histories of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and develops a quantitative method to document how the innovations of a discipline are contingent upon interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research networks. Finally, this project traces how the allocation of resources to particular research communities spurred scientific innovation in adjacent and seemingly unrelated academic research fields in the physical and social sciences. In this sense, the discipline of machine learning provides a useful case study for modeling the propagation of ideas across different subfields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both qualitative and quantitative historical research is employed. First, nine university and government archives are perused to reconstruct the institutional organizations, interpersonal research networks, and material computing devices available to machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers. Second, an investigation is conducted using a novel combination of topic modeling and word embeddings on a corpus of millions of full-text Association of Computing Machinery articles from 1950 to 2017 to trace how discursive influence propagates across disparate sub-disciplines. Four research products are generated: (1) a technical machine learning publication detailing the novel method used to analyze the article corpus, (2) a history of science article tracing the early history of machine learning, (3) a general audience ""think piece"" discussing the policy and ethical implications of contemporary machine learning research, (4) and the public release of the project code and the subsequent statistics generated from the article corpus. Digital copies of salient archive records discovered during this research study will be made freely available via Columbia University's Digital Repository, insofar as this is possible given the copyright and access restrictions of holding institutions. Archive materials collected and computational study of the article corpus will be used in the co-PI's doctoral dissertation exploring how machine learning has been used to classify individuals, imagine communities, and legislate forms of social and political evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will focus on married couples to explore the costs of flexible and lower-hour jobs, the role of geographic moves that favor one member of the couple over the other, and the relative impact on women of working for lesser-paying firms versus lower wage growth within firms to explain the gap.   Despite progress in education and the workplace, women still earn less than men, even when adjusted for education, hours of work, and experience. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' gender earnings gap in the US is around 20 percent for full-time workers. The gap, however, is not a single number.  Rather, it is a shifting statistic across lifetimes. The earnings gap for women relative to comparable men is small directly after education is completed.  However, the gap widens substantially with family formation, particularly among the most educated.  Reducing or eliminating the gender earnings gap has surfaced recently as an issue of vital policy importance.  The results of this research will improve the efficiency of the labor market, hence spur economic growth as well as lead to gender equity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will construct, and use a large and extraordinary dataset to explore the complicated dynamics of the gender earnings gap (the gap). The research will broaden and deepen our understanding of the widening gender earnings gap by following couples, across time and around critical events, such as marriage and births. The research will use the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) dataset linked to the US Census, CPS, and ACS survey data. The LEHD gives longitudinal information on individual employee earnings by firm. The linkages to census data will provide further information on the employees and the employment and workplaces of each spouse. The PIs will also be able to perform event studies of earnings and employment responses following changes such as marriage, birth, and household residence and employment moves. The expanded LEHD data platform will make it possible to estimate the impact of tied-stayer, tied-mover effects, do various types of event studies, and link firms to their stated family-friendly policies. The LEHD-Census data makes it possible to analyze important life events and connect the results to existing firm-level policies that are relevant for policies to close the gaps in earnings and employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to earlier environmental accords, which concentrated on internationally-proscribed commitments, recent international agreements are based on diverse national approaches.  This research addresses a gap in understanding of how vulnerable communities and their interests interact with the new international system of nationally-determined contributions.  Given that farming communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of increasing environmental variability, detailed analysis of the implications of the new international agreements by local communities is needed.  The research will enhance the understanding of how the interests of farmers in environmentally vulnerable and food-insecure communities interact with national contributions to international accords, with implications for environmental adaptation efforts in the agriculture sector. The research anticipates identifying opportunities for national contributions under the international agreements by directing attention to local priorities and initiatives.  To that end, the project will engage local, regional, and national stakeholders and decision-makers.  As a Dissertation Research Improvement Award, support for this analysis meaningfully advances the student's research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research answers three questions: (1) How does a national government align its national plans with local policies and project implementation plans regarding food insecurity? (2) How does the content of a national government's international commitment affect priority-setting, implementation, and relationships around internationally-funded food security initiatives? And,(3) How does the country-by-country structure of the international agreement affect the inclusion of local interests?  In the context of a South African case study, the doctoral student will conduct research using mixed methods, including interviews with diplomats and government representatives, interviews with municipal officials, extension agents, and community organizations, interviews with smallholder farmers and community residents, and observation of internationally-funded adaptation projects in local communities. The research will also incorporate existing data such as national sustainable development plans and policies.  The project stands to make contributions to understanding the enactment of international accords at the local level, and this has the potential to advance theory on environmental governance as the research will evaluate the alignment of policies and priorities across scales of governance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet we understand relatively little about the process of negotiating peace in civil wars. The goal of this project is to better understand the process of negotiating peace agreements to end civil conflicts. To that end, it analyzes the multiple stages of the peace process: initiation (negotiation offers), pre-bargaining (agreeing to negotiate), negotiations (reaching an agreement), and implementation (ending the conflict). Understanding each stage is important because there are often multiple starts and stops throughout the peace process. With so many killed and displaced by civil conflicts around the world, understanding the particularities of this multi-stage process, and how the actions of international actors can facilitate (or may actually hamper) the process, is of critical importance for international peace and security. This project studies the complexities of the peace process, can enable international actors to be more effective in their efforts to end civil conflicts. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While there are several studies on the outcomes of civil conflicts, as well as characteristics of the peace agreements that sometimes end them, there is a dearth of knowledge about the process itself: when and why warring parties will choose to move forward through its multiple stages and when and why they might withdraw from the process. To fill this gap, the principle investigators are drawing on primary and secondary documentation to create a comprehensive dataset on peace negotiations in civil conflicts from 1945-2016. Primary sources include UN and other international organization documents and signed peace agreements. Secondary sources include historical accounts of civil conflicts around the world. The dataset codes each stage of the negotiation process (negotiation, agreement, and implementation). If a breakdown occurred at any stage, the dataset includes detailed information on which of the parties (government or rebel group) refused to move forward in the peace process (refused to negotiate, walked away from negotiations, or failed to implement the agreement). Third-party actions such as mediation or military, economic, or diplomatic intervention will also be collected. This new dataset will allow the principle investigators to conduct a detailed, quantitative investigation of the peace process as it played out across a wide variety of civil conflicts, and the conditions under which successes or breakdowns occurred at the various stages.  The principal investigators will also address the non-random selection of belligerents into later stages of the peace process through a variety of statistical methods. The findings illuminate how governments and rebel groups can navigate the peace process in civil conflicts successfully and what role third party actors play in facilitating that process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems of systems are designed to provide critical goods and services. Thus, their collective resilience to the range of disruptions from mild to catastrophic, of malicious, technological or natural cause, is crucial to the nation's economic competitiveness and, more generally, societal well-being. An underlying principle that has guided the solicitation and selection of awards is that to tackle such complex human-cyber-physical systems problems or create new opportunities through their inherent properties requires integration of cyber, engineering and societal perspectives. Consequently, an important objective of the CRISP solicitation has been to foster an interdisciplinary research community of engineers, computer and computational scientists and social and behavioral scientists. To this end, a grantee workshop will be held. This workshop will involve activities designed to: (1) enable the sharing of research developments and findings from funded CRISP/RIPS projects; (2) promote interactions among awardees, including students and postdoctoral fellows; (3) foster the creation of new interdisciplinary approaches; (4) enhance and strengthen the resilience and socio-technical systems community; and (5) enable new collaborations and the formulation of novel ideas. The meeting will contribute to the enhancement and improvement of scientific engineering and education activities through lectern presentations, a workshop-wide poster session, lectures on focus topics, activities, and organized discussions. Outcomes of the workshop, including newly generated ideas from the meeting, future research needs and more, will be documented in a final report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enhance and improve scientific knowledge in the areas of complex, interconnected and interdependent infrastructure systems of physical, cyber and human components.

The workshop will also stimulate new research paths in these areas and beyond. Designing, planning for, operating and controlling resilient infrastructure systems, as well as understanding how failures propagate across systems and over time when not prevented, are crucial for building and maintaining a vibrant, well-functioning, prosperous and secure civil society. Bringing together experts from across disciplines and technical specialties to share their knowledge in these areas will aid the nation in this purpose.

It is widely accepted that the brain plays an essential role in shaping antisocial behaviors, but the precise nature of these processes is poorly understood. Previous scholarship has raised the possibility that methods of assessing risk in adjudicated individuals could be improved by including measures of brain function along with traditional behavioral and social measures. This project examines whether the inclusion of noninvasive brain measures can enhance the ability to correctly distinguish between those inmates most and least likely to experience antisocial outcomes, such as rearrest. The project also supports the training and professional development of students in cognitive neuroscience. The results of this project are expected to support the development of clinical tools, procedures and treatments for assessing and remediating risk in forensic populations, thereby reducing the associated costs to society. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are achieved by conducting the first large, out-of-sample longitudinal test of a neurocognitive model of persistent antisocial behavior. The model is developed in a sample of 600 adult criminal offenders who have undergone task-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging and been assessed for reoffense risk 12 months following release from prison (the training sample). This model is then used to classify a separate sample of 100 criminal offenders who are similarly scanned, released, and followed (the testing sample). The project employs both theory-driven (null hypothesis testing of a neurocognitive model of impulse control) and data-driven (e.g., whole-brain machine learning classification) analytical approaches. This project will advance basic and clinical knowledge of how neurobiological and behavioral risk factors interact to produce antisocial behavior by characterizing their combined and relative utility in assessing risk. This knowledge can, in turn, be used to inform the development of treatment approaches that are more sensitive to individual defendants' unique risk needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It focuses on two sites in Sao Paulo, a contemporary network of public fablabs and the 1970s-80s electronics industry, and its aim is to examine the reconfiguration of improvisation in the context of growing discussions about innovation from the global South. This work will shed light on how practices commonly considered peripheral to sophisticated technological production have been used to remake dominant models of technological development across changing contexts, contributing to current debates on innovation in a global perspective, improvisation as a technical and sociocultural phenomenon, and the relationship between skill and expertise. A key impact of this project will be to expand academic and public discussions about sustainable and inclusive technologies by attending to the cultivation of improvisational technical skills associated with fixing, repurposing, and creating technologies. It will serve to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM through its focus on community-oriented innovation hubs and collaborative methodologies.

She will examine what happens when global corporate logics of innovation meet socially embedded experiences of improvisation; this will facilitate contributing to an emergent literature in STS that challenges the typical center-to-periphery arrows of technology transfer and diffusionist innovation theories. She also plans to investigate practices of improvisation in two contexts of technological production, one at the beginning of consumer electronics, where the manufacturing of analog devices was under strict protectionism; the other focusing on new forms of digital production in the globalized neoliberal moment, which will provide a productive genealogy for thinking about improvisation as a contemporary political-economic project in Brazil.

Thomas Pluckhahn (University of South Florida) and Victor Thompson (University of Georgia) will undertake research regarding the manner in which common property regimes shift over time in relation to changes in environmental and socio-political contexts. The longstanding notion that common property resources are effectively managed only through state control or private property regimes has been refuted time and again by anthropological and historical case studies demonstrating how social groups ranging from small communities to nation-states have devised effective systems of resource management, some of which endure for long periods of time. However, the manner in which common property institutions develop and change over time is poorly understood. As a result, researchers also lack the ability to reliably predict how existing regimes may change with respect to future perturbations in natural and social environments.&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Pluckhahn and Thompson, along with a team of graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar, will study changes in sea tenure - the collectively-managed use rights to fisheries - among the native societies of the Tampa Bay estuary during the late Holocene, from around AD 250 to 1650. Spanish accounts from the end of this time range describe a fractured socio-political landscape comprised of warring, territorially-based chiefdoms, while archaeological evidence from the earlier range of the time frame suggests a more dispersed population with less social stratification and little inter-group conflict. The research tests the hypothesis that this transformation was the result of changes in sea tenure occurring in conjunction with shifts in the natural and social environments, through a program of archaeological and paleoecological testing. For the reconstruction of ancient systems of sea tenure, the research employs isotopic studies of oyster shells in concert with the analysis of the relative abundance of shellfish species with varying salinity tolerances, to model habitat of collection. To reconstruct the local and regional manifestations of global shifts in climate, the researchers will collect pollen and sediments from wetlands adjacent to archaeological sites. Changes in socio-political organization will be identified through a program of archaeological testing and shallow geophysics at mound and village complexes. Temporal control is provided by a rigorous program of radiocarbon dating. This interdisciplinary dataset will contribute to a better understanding of how common property resource management systems may be remade over time and, in doing so, offer insights potentially useful for predicting changes in contemporary public policies regulating common-property resources as diverse as air, water, gene pools, and the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the relationships between land-use change, water, and agriculture is crucial to balancing tradeoffs between the environmental costs associated with converting forests and other natural habitats to crop fields and pasture, and the need to increase food production to meet growing demands as global populations and incomes rise. This project will contribute to the health and welfare of the United States and elsewhere by informing choices about how to increase agricultural output while limiting impacts on water, atmosphere and biodiversity.  It will enhance research and education infrastructure by expanding a scientifically relevant and publicly-available dataset linking a survey of farm households to data and models of land and water use.  Lastly, it will develop capacity in interdisciplinary research through the training of students and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land-use decisions of individual farmers can aggregate up to landscape-level changes that influence the regional hydroclimate in ways that alter the availability of water for agricultural production, including both soil moisture or 'green' water and surface/ground or 'blue' water.  How farmers adjust their investment and land-use decisions in response to water scarcity has implications for agricultural productivity and ultimately the supply of agricultural commodities.  This project will advance basic scientific knowledge of the dynamic feedbacks among agricultural production choices, regional environmental variability, and vulnerability to water stress.  It will address questions of how environmental variability and land-use changes affect the regional hydroclimate and property-level green and blue water; the extent to which individual farmers are vulnerable to variation in green and blue water and how they adapt; and how inter-related farmer production decisions aggregate to determine water, land-use, production and welfare outcomes under different policy scenarios.  Data from a unique long-term household panel survey (1996-2018) will be combined with data and models of land cover, climate and hydrology to understand the effects of the regional hydroclimate on property-level water availability and the effects of water availability on agricultural production decisions.

Deportation is a widely significant contemporary social, political, and intellectual problem. Existing social science scholarship has theorized deportation as a straightforward politics of exclusion that culminates in the removal of people from one national territory and their return to another. However, for most people, deportation is not only an endpoint; it also marks the beginning of long-term efforts to build viable post-deportation lives. Yet despite the key role that nation states play in shaping their citizens' decisions to migrate in the first place as well as their post-deportation experiences, contexts of return have received little sustained research attention. This project takes a broader perspective to provide the more complete picture that is needed by both theorists and policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by Loyola University of Chicago anthropologist, Dr. Ruth M.

Using a multi-year and multi-sited approach, this project involves the sustained ethnographic research necessary to better understand the sociopolitical afterlife of deportation and its effects in both Mexico and the United States. The research design comprises a three-year study of the contexts of deportees in Mexico City and Chicago. The researcher will use a mix of ethnographic research methods including participant observation, digital ethnography, in-depth and follow-up interviews, targeted semi-structured interviews, and research on state and municipal policies regarding migration and deportees. The study population will include Mexican government agents, a sample of deportees, and organizations that work with deportees. Findings from this research will advance a more robust and reliable theorization of life after deportation in three key ways. 1. The project's longitudinal design will provide the time depth needed to understand post-deportation life. 2. The analytical focus on deportees' interactions with Mexican state agencies will illuminate the role of emigrant states in shaping contexts of migrant return. 3. Attention to the quotidian activities of deportees will shed light on dynamic, cross-border cultural formations that arise in response to global securitization concerns.

As China gains visibility on the world stage, the number of adult (post-puberty) second language learners of Mandarin is growing, as is the number of Mandarin heritage speakers, individuals who were exposed to Mandarin from their parents since birth, but as adults are dominant in English. This project will examine how second language learners and heritage speakers of Mandarin acquire four different linguistic properties of Mandarin. The project will have potential implications for language pedagogy, by identifying problem areas facing learners of Mandarin and providing information about challenges that face heritage speakers vs. traditional classroom learners. Given that Mandarin is a relatively understudied language, this project will increase our understanding of this language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies on heritage Spanish have found heritage speakers to have a selective advantage over second language learners on phonology but not on morphosyntax. The goal of this study is to examine whether such selective advantages hold for Mandarin, one of the hardest languages for English speakers to acquire. This study investigates whether, when both Mandarin proficiency and the dominant language (English) are held constant, early age of acquisition confers an advantage to heritage speakers over second language learners, and whether this depends on the linguistic domain (phonology, morpho-semantics, syntax, and syntax-semantics interface). Three groups (native speakers, heritage speakers and second language learners) will complete three psycholinguistic tasks testing four Mandarin linguistic phenomena: tone sandhi, aspect marking, relative clauses, and long-distance reflexives.

The organizations that will support and benefit from the WFRDC include the University of Utah, Utah State University, Brigham Young University, Huntsman Cancer Institute (a National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center), departments within the Utah state government, and the University of Utah Health Sciences Center.  The WFRDC will facilitate collaborations between scientists in Utah and the Intermountain region. It will allow researchers to explore novel questions in areas such as health, medical care, work force trends, population dynamics, and environmental issues. The insights created from these investigations will advance scientific knowledge and provide benefits to residents in the Intermountain West, local government agencies, and the federal statistical system. The long-term effects of the WFRDC will include enhanced educational and employment development, collaborations between institutions and disciplines, and better informed government agencies. Researchers and students receiving training through the WFRDC will promote workforce development and provide opportunities for students to gain expertise in data science and other novel methods.

Many of these practices continue to be used by scientists today to study and manage erosion, flooding, water scarcity, and a wide range of other water-related problems. This project will shed light on the historical origins of practices of data collection, management, analysis, and sharing that continue to be used by earth and environmental scientists. The requested funds will support travel for archival research, and for undergraduate and graduate student research assistants.

To develop mathematical models of interactions between water and land, hydrologists and fluvial geomorphologists found it necessary to gather new kinds of data and to develop new ways of organizing, analyzing, and sharing them. In some cases, they re-purposed existing sources of data, while in other cases they launched entirely new data-gathering enterprises including novel kinds of field surveys and laboratory experiments. They also established new agreements and institutions to standardize data and encourage data sharing. These data practices proved critical to the management of water resources in the rapidly developing U.S. West as well as in other arid regions around the world. They also proved controversial; various stakeholders fought to determine which data were relevant, whether they could be trusted, and how they should be interpreted. This project will show how the sciences of water informed responses to emerging water problems and were in turn shaped by them.

One pernicious type of inaccuracy is an optimism bias, in which preferred outcomes are viewed as more likely than warranted and/or unpreferred outcomes are viewed as less likely than warranted.  Optimism biases lead to problematic individual behaviors like unwise risk taking and over-purchasing, human tragedies like deaths from engineering failures and societally important phenomena like stock market bubbles.  Motivational goals are often assumed to underlie optimism biases but there is an inadequate understanding of when different goals impact optimism, including goals that have the potential to reduce optimism and promote accuracy.  In fact, major theories assume that preferences for outcomes and expectations about the outcomes are independent, which is inconsistent with some empirical findings. The proposed research addresses this discrepancy. The research is structured by a novel Goal-Biased Expectations Framework, which posits contextual features that shape the balance between two orientations that a person can take toward forming expectations.  The balance of orientations ultimately determines whether and how goals shape expectations.  The framework is also useful for developing steps to debias or reduce overoptimism and promote accuracy among professional forecasters and the public.  Debiasing overoptimism can yield improved predictions and ultimately better planning, preparation, and outcomes across many contexts (e.g., financial, health, security).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three lines of experiments will be conducted.  One line will examine the scope of, and processes responsible for, a crucial difference in how measures of expectations are affected by outcome desirability or preference.  Past research findings have returned quite different indicators of the extent to which outcome desirability has a biasing influence, but these differences might align with a distinction between two ways in which expectations are commonly solicited in studies and in everyday contexts.  A second line will address how types of available information influence the desirability bias.  One surprising possibility is that as information becomes more clear, people's orientation and goals shift in a manner that produces more bias rather than less. A third line will test a novel debiasing intervention for overoptimism.  Participants in the studies will include sports fans, owners of homes in floodplains, and patients?three groups known to exhibit overoptimism. All of the proposed work will inform the validity of the Goal-Biased Expectations framework.

To the extent our limited capacity for information processing capacity is a major source of such errors, better understanding of cognitive processes will yield more effective methods for predicting and reducing the poor decisions that put workers at risk. Accordingly, this study will complete a series of eye-tracking experiments to build an error-detection framework - the Human-Error Detection Framework - that computes the likelihood of human error in occupational settings to enable proactive countermeasures to keep workers safe. Subsequently, to extend the value of this framework, this project will enrich and expand research-based educational materials, outreach, and engagement activities to spread awareness about this framework to communities and workers. To achieve these goals, this multidisciplinary project blends research linking eye movements and workers' attention with research focused on working-memory load and decision making in order to discover how and why workers in dynamic work environments fail to detect, comprehend, and/or respond to physical risks. Using the dynamic and high-risk environment of construction as a testbed, the proposed framework will connect eye movements and cognitive manipulations in laboratory and field experiments with worker demographics to identify precursors that predict accident-causing human errors in dynamic worksites. In all, this project will demonstrate the value and effectiveness of synthesizing cognitive psychology, engineering, and advanced computation to improve decision making and occupational safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Human-Error Detection Framework will harness real-time eye-movement patterns to identify human errors and thereby lay the foundation for synthesizing technology with data analysis to automatically identify and interrupt human decision-making errors before injuries occur. Using the predictive models resulting from this study will not only contribute to significant accident reduction but will also provide a critical validation measure to confirm the effectiveness of training programs in enhancing workers' risk-analysis skills. Furthermore, since this project provides tools and insights for researchers, students, and workers to use to enhance occupational safety and multidisciplinary research, this project will evolve the broader pedagogical landscape of the decision, risk, and management sector. As this innovative research challenges the conventional, reactionary paradigm of safety-risk management by enabling the identification of at-risk workers using a measurable indicator of their cognitive processes, i.e., their eye movements, the proposed proactive approach to occupational safety has the potential for averting occupational accidents across industries and thereby will foreseeably prevent the injuries that undermine the well-being of millions of American workers and their families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how people gain access to wealth is therefore critically important in efforts to eradicate poverty and promote well-being. Research among marginalized populations within the United States suggests that restricted access to material wealth and formal education results in risk pooling by sharing limited resources through kin and friendship networks. But those same networks may also restrict individual access to material wealth and thereby inhibit economic mobility. Understanding how social networks either buffer against risk or impede access to the forms of wealth most closely associated with well-being is necessary for policy makers and social scientists who wish to understand the causes and consequences of poverty and associated social problems. Therefore, the research supported by this award will investigate the relationship between economic development and a range of wealth types, including material wealth, health, education, and social networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by Dr. Siobhan Mattison (University of New Mexico), Dr. Tami Blumenfield Kedar (Furman University), and Dr. Mary Shenk (University of Missouri). To understand how various forms of wealth interact with each other and with health to affect well-being, the team has designed a comparative study in two societies where access to material wealth, education, and healthcare is rapidly changing and altering local social networks. The study populations comprise two small-scale agricultural populations, the Mosuo of Southwest China and the villagers of Matlab, a rural district in Bangladesh. In both places, formerly subsistence-based populations are rapidly becoming integrated with regional, national, and international markets in labor and goods. This provides a natural experiment that allows them explore how recent and ongoing shifts in labor and educational opportunities, family systems, and demographic processes affect wealth and well-being. The researchers will conduct demographic and social network surveys to collect economic and social information, take anthropometric measures to assess health, and conduct focus groups, in-depth interviews, and short video interviews to examine local interpretations of wealth and well-being. The comparative approach employed by the study will allow an understanding of how different social norms and institutions act to either help or limit access to changing forms of wealth. Findings will also show whether these norms are protective or harmful with respect to well-being in different socio-economic contexts. The results of this study will provide a detailed understanding of how individual-level and larger-level social constraints affect the distribution of wealth and well-being in economies undergoing economic development, thus providing a useful model for understanding the opportunities and challenges affecting people struggling to thrive in the United States and around the world.

Future experiences never repeat exactly and the world often poses new never-before encountered problems. Therefore, training systems that lead to effective generalization are sought after in both human and machine learning. Extensive experience with many training examples is known to promote generalization but this requires time and a large set of training examples.  There are cases of human learning in which appropriate generalization requires only one or a few examples, or 'few-shot' learning. The human infant begins learns to become a few-shot learner of visual object categories who is able, for example, to appropriately generalize the category 'tractor' after seeing a tractor. This research will determine the learning experiences that teach young children to be few-shot learners of visual object categories with the goal of determining the general principles of training sets that lead to rapid learning and generalization.  These principles will be tested in machine learning models and in experiments with children. General principles of how to design and structure training materials to lead to effective learning and rapid generalization have useful applications in education, in image recognition, and in machine learning. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Most models and theories of category learning concentrate on learning to discriminate categories with training consisting of many examples of many different categories. Despite remarkable advances in computer vision there is a large class of problems that remain unsolved because they require few-shot learning.  Despite extensive research on educational practices, there is a limited understanding of how best to structure material for generalization and knowledge transfer. In becoming few-shot learners of visual object categories, human infants first collect extensive experience with a few individual objects within a few early-learned categories -- their own sippy cup, the family dog, their own shoes and then they progress to becoming rapid few-shot learners of other visual object categories. The core hypothesis tested in the research is that few-shot learning emerges as a generalization of expertise about a very few categories. The research will capture the visual experiences supporting the development of expertise for a few categories using head cameras and head-mounted eye trackers worn by infants. Algorithms from visual science and computer vision will be used to analyze the statistical properties of these visual experiences and of expertise that then generalizes to other visual categories.  Those principles will be tested in behavioral experiments with infants and tested and formalized in modeling experiments using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  The principles offer a solution to the problem of rapid generalization from few examples that is potentially general to any visual learning problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For women, age is one of the best predictors of fertility: that is, whether a woman will be able to conceive. Younger women are typically more fertile, and ability to conceive declines until a woman reaches menopause. However, the age at which an individual woman becomes less fertile varies depending on many factors unique to her individual body, including genetic makeup, diet, lifestyle, and environment. Over the past decade, medical providers have increased the use of a simple blood test to measure a woman's anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level, a hormone secreted by a woman's remaining pool of eggs. AMH level has been used in some medical settings as an indicator of fertility, with lower values suggesting reduced fertility. AMH screening is a low-cost fertility test and is becoming more widely available in the United States. As AMH testing is becoming more widespread, it is important to understand how women are using test results as a tool in family planning and to navigate their biological parenthood options. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of improving public health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moira Kyweluk, under the supervision of Dr. Thomas McDade of Northwestern University, will explore the cultural and social dimensions of AMH testing. The research will take place at two locations where AMH testing is common: first, at a network of private clinics that offer fertility testing for low out-of-pocket costs directly to consumers and second, at a large research hospital fertility clinic where testing is often a part of family planning using reproductive technologies like egg freezing and in vitro fertilization. The project uses anthropology methods including careful observation and recording of conversations in both clinics, as well as interviews with patients and providers who deliver test results. Qualitative data will help the research team understand why and when women seek AMH testing, as well as the role of romantic partners, family and social networks on accessing fertility testing and taking action using test results. Importantly, this project will gather data on experiences with low-cost fertility testing from women from diverse socioeconomic statuses, races, ethnicities and sexual orientations, deliberately including women often overlooked in research on reproductive technologies, since most patients who have access to fertility medical care in the United States and thus comprise the majority of research participants are white and affluent. Ultimately, data from this project will be important in helping women and providers make decisions about when, whether, and how to take this sort of fertility test since it can have impacts on family planning decisions, emotional health, and social life. Early fertility screening and ongoing screening throughout a woman's life could soon become a standard of care. Information from these interviews will be available to the public to give women more information about others' experiences with elective AMH testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, how does a person lift a cup of coffee without spilling or a factory worker line up a Phillips-head screwdriver with the grooves on a screw? Although we perform these tasks routinely without giving them too much thought, dexterous manipulation is one of the most complex and least understood human skills and one that still limits the utility of robots in industry. Of particular interest is understanding the brain mechanisms that allow people to learn to manipulate an object one way (e.g., to lift a mug by the handle) and then apply that knowledge differently (e.g., to lift the same mug by its sides). The investigators are working towards a comprehensive theory, at both the neural and behavioral levels, of how people learn and generalize these hand-object interactions. The results may inspire new robotic manipulators that are more dexterous, with human-like ability to generalize a learned motor behavior to novel contexts. The work may also influence development of more dexterous neuroprosthetics. The project's other broader impacts include a public lecture and discussion on the social and ethical implications of human-robot systems and participation in the ""Science Cafe"" series hosted by the Arizona Science Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work by the investigators has provided evidence for two scenarios for learning how to manipulate objects. In one scenario, people build a high-level (i.e., task-level) representation of object manipulation, which allows them to generalize the learned manipulation to a different context. For example, people successfully manipulate an object even after a finger is removed from, or added to, the object's contact surface or when the object is manipulated by the contralateral arm. In a second scenario, people build an effector-level representation. In this case, they persist in generating the same finger placement and forces despite a new context that requires different solutions, as when an object with an asymmetric mass distribution is rotated. What are the neural mechanisms involved with promoting or interfering with generalization of learned hand-object interactions? Can neural representations at the task level - enabling generalization - be built following repeated exposure to a different manipulation context? These questions represent a significant gap in our understanding of skilled object manipulation. The overall goal of this collaborative research is to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying task- and effector-level representations of hand-object interactions. The studies will record finger position and forces utilized when grasping objects in order to probe the influence of the context in which a given hand-object interaction is learned. Electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to determine the neural correlates of successful and unsuccessful generalizations to new contexts. Quantification of these behavioral variables and the corresponding brain mechanisms will provide insights into how objects are mentally represented and how these representations underlie planning and execution of dexterous manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This theory, unlike most linguistic theories, incorporates time as an inherent part of the elements that make up words (consonants and vowels).  Theoretical testing has resulted in new and insightful interpretations of phenomena.  This project examines accomplishments and theoretical directions, because symbolic treatments of phonology (which have sequencing but not time) are in a state of flux.  Many have begun adding elements like those used in Articulatory Phonology, but those implementations miss critical theoretical elements. Further, measures that result in the kinds of data that the theory depends on, such as measurements of tongue movement, have become easier to use and more widely used.  The workshop will include theoretical presentations with promising directions discussed.  Outcomes will include innovative experimental plans and scientific dissemination, as well as deeper understanding of sounds of speech which could inform technological advances in communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the basis of phonology, which allows us to have an unlimited number of words, is important to theoretical linguistics, to the documentation of endangered languages, and to the remediation of speech impairments.  Despite the progress modern linguists have made in understanding the sounds of speech, there are still issues that resist analysis.  The variable changes that take place as a speaker speaks more quickly are continuous in nature, but symbolic representations struggle to accommodate such results.  Vowel and consonant harmony, in which features of one vowel (or consonant) affect the realization of another in the same word, have been incompletely accounted for in previous phonologies, despite the sizable number of languages that exhibit harmony.  For endangered languages, preparing material that will be of use to descendants and the larger community who want to revive the language has become increasingly important.  Because symbolic descriptions leave out a great deal of detail, they are not ideally suited to this purpose.  The theoretical account of Articulatory Phonology, along with the physiological records that would be collected in generating an account, could provide a better platform for revitalization.  Many speech disorders are considered ""phonological"", but the theory that underlies the procedures in speech pathology is not always fully articulated.  Reexamination of the basic units, such as comparing phonemes to articulatory gestures, holds promise of further improvement in remediation.

The recent financial crisis raised questions about the effects of market fragmentation, the impact of new exchanges, and the possibility of excessive financial innovation, calling for new areas of investigation and modeling. This project has two broad objectives. First, it will identify potential sources of efficiency gains associated with decentralized trading. Second, the project will contribute general principles for financial market design as well as support for policy evaluation and methods that would help develop a theory of imperfectly competitive fragmented markets. The research could help achieve greater efficiency and revenue, while meeting important societal objectives for equality and incentives.

To the growing literature on decentralized trading, which has explored over-the-counter (bilateral) transactions, this research contributes methods for equilibrium analysis of general market structures with multiple coexisting exchanges and flexible contracts. The research team will examine three classes of instruments that would be redundant if trading were either competitive or centralized: (1) the creation of new trading venues for existing assets and exchange design, (2) the introduction of new assets, and (3) innovation in the types of market clearing that decentralized trading enables. The results will demonstrate the greater potential of market design to increase efficiency relative to centralized trading. As classical methods for equilibrium analysis, which are based on spanning, do not apply in (imperfectly competitive) decentralized markets, this research will develop an alternative approach.

The project seeks to advance how economists study individuals who must make decisions when the environment and possible outcomes are uncertain. People often appear to avoid these kinds of situations, preferring to safe and well-understood options over choices that seem risky, uncertain, or ambiguous in their benefits. Understanding how risk and ambiguity affect choices is important not only for predicting a host of individual decisions, such as saving, investment, education, and job selection. This kind of economic theory is also important assessing the impact of different policies, technological changes, or other economic factors on the economy. Not surprisingly, ambiguity aversion and pessimistic attitudes towards risk have played an ever-increasing role in applications to macroeconomics and finance. The research effort will address a gap in our current economic theory. It will provide a better model of how individuals make use of new information about risky and ambiguous situations. The model will also help us understand how attitudes towards risk and ambiguity compare across individuals. Finally, the new theory may offer sharper predictions. The team will use an approach based on evolution and adaptation to build this new theory. The project could develop new tools for use by business managers and policymakers, who often must form accurate predictions of how customers, employees, citizens, and other individuals will behave in risky situations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is now an abundance of research providing decision-theoretic foundations to models of ambiguity and risk aversion, much less is known about how evolution might select between competing models and approaches. This project will advance basic theory regarding risk and ambiguity by providing an evolutionary foundation for a new model, the adaptive model, that imposes significant structure on ambiguity and risk aversion. Important features will be that preferences should be dynamically consistent, even at the cost of consequentialism, and that different ambiguity preferences go hand in hand with departures from expected utility theory in the context of risk. Depending on how effectively individuals of a genotype can adapt the expression of their phenotype, the adaptive model can nest variants of several prominent models in the literature as special cases. This will permit the evaluation of these models based on a new set of primitive assumptions and will extend the general insights about the structure of preferences under uncertainty and their updating to applications of those models in the contexts of finance, macro and policy choice. The project will also help strengthen the interdisciplinary bridge between the fields of decision theory and evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is large enough to attract high quality researchers, but small enough for individuals to get important feedback on their work and develop mentoring and professional networks. The graduate students funded by this project stand to benefit in both ways. First, the work that they present will get critical comments from leading methodologists and statisticians. In addition to the senior scholars presenting, several others will attend the conference as discussants. Theses senior scholars will include guests from other universities as well as members of the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University, which will encourage interdisciplinary work. Getting feedback on their research posters from these scholars will significantly improve the quality of their work. Second, the connections the graduate students make with the faculty have the potential to have long lasting effects. Students will be assigned a specific mentor and the individualized relationship will hopefully last beyond this meeting. These networking connections can have lasting effects on a person's scholarship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of the graduate students at SLAMM has clear implications for their educational success.

An underlying premise is that people may respond to diversity differently depending the specific racial/ethnic groups that make up that diversity.  The first part of the project will examine how people from different racial/ethnic backgrounds define diversity, followed by distinguishing heterogeneity from the share of non-Whites in a community. The second part asks whether and how people learn from past cross-racial interactions and become trusting toward strangers from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. The third part of this project studies neighborhoods in a large urban city where diversity functions well, i.e., where neighbors have repeatedly organized to achieve common goals, despite racial/ethnic differences between them. In this phase of the research, the project investigates the mechanisms, such as information sharing and sanctioning, that successfully promote cooperation between people from different backgrounds.  The project will create a research practicum for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students that will focus on experimental research methods.  The project will also continue and expand upon an ongoing initiative that has created an experimental design workshop.  This workshop brings together experimental social scientists from across the university to exchange ideas  and receive feedback on original experimental research. A final educational initiative will involve a weeklong summer school on the topic of experiments in the social sciences, which will be open to Ph.D. students from several local universities.  The project will provide insights useful in formulating and implementing policies such as those concerning affirmative action, immigration and residential integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will first clarify the meaning of diversity and the burden-of-proof for documenting the effects of diversity. Second, it will analyze how members of racial/ethnic minority groups, not just Whites, react to diversity.  Third, it will bring innovative experimental methods to bear on questions of longstanding sociological interest. To shed light on understandings of diversity, the first part of this project relies on a conjoint experiment with a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, including strategic oversamples of non-Whites. A second part involves a public goods game where participants are assigned to heterogeneous groups, homogeneously White groups, or homogeneously non-White groups. The goal is to understand how people respond not just to diversity, but also to the share of specific racial/ethnic groups. The third part involves recruiting White and non-White residents of diverse and homogeneous urban neighborhoods. These participants will participate in an online survey with behavioral game components. The behavioral games capture altruism, trust, and cooperativeness toward both in-group and out-group members. They also allow the researcher to address social desirability bias, to observe real-stakes behavior, to disentangle micro-level motivations and mechanisms, and to clarify the scope conditions around hypotheses. Taken together, this project will bring clarity to the growing but inconclusive social scientific literature on racial/ethnic diversity, both by informing theories of diversity and by producing new empirical findings regarding intergroup relations in diverse communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators examine immigration law in the U.S. South, a prominent new immigrant destination region marked by radically different state-level approaches to immigration governance. The researchers draw on interviews, media analysis, and archival data to understand the origins of different enforcement regimes.  Findings will clarify patterns of access to key institutions that affect immigrant incorporation with significant implications for communities, organizations, and state entities that work with new immigrant populations. More broadly, this project will reveal the forces that drive a patchwork policy system that increasingly grants subnational entities jurisdiction across a range of legal issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States and globally, immigration laws exist at the intersection of two prevailing trends: the criminalization and racialization of non-citizens and the devolution of legal enforcement to subnational authorities. Dominant explanations for variation in state immigration law emphasize the role of partisan politics, political ideology, and demographic change. However, these paradigms cannot satisfactorily explain recent lawmaking patterns in new immigrant destinations. Comparing two cases (Alabama and Georgia) where conservative politics and a growing Latino population gave rise to omnibus anti-immigrant laws to two cases (Mississippi and North Carolina) where the same forces did not have the same result will help to specify the dynamics that drive the criminalization of immigrants and the extension of states' punitive powers. The researchers examine the role of interracial activist networks in thwarting enforcement efforts. Specifically, the project examines Black-Latino coalitions as (1) cultural brokers, race makers who strategically shape beliefs about Black-Latino commonalities and diffuse these racial schemata across media, legal, and political forums and as (2) organizational brokers, liaisons who forge or activate networks across established legal movements (labor, civil rights) to heighten the political risks of supporting anti-immigrant laws and pressure lawmakers to reject such reforms. Findings will help elucidate how social context and non-state actors shape immigration law and specify the central role that advocacy organizations and legal processes play in the racial formation process. As the country becomes majority-minority, such findings will also have important implications for our understanding of the role of the legal context in shaping immigrant incorporation and racialization in the contemporary United States."

However, the complex relationships between the states (that is, the patterns,&lt;br/&gt;pathways, and mechanisms underlying how policies actually diffuse from one state to another)&lt;br/&gt;are not well understood. In this research, the PIs develop innovative tools and&lt;br/&gt;data to facilitate the large-scale computational and data-intensive study of policy diffusion. They&lt;br/&gt;seek to develop and utilize the largest database on states' decisions to adopt policies to better&lt;br/&gt;understand which states are policy leaders, which are policy followers, and why. This will&lt;br/&gt;provide a novel, expansive, and systematic view of the policy diffusion process that covers the&lt;br/&gt;American states. As a result, policymakers and other interested stakeholders will have access to a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive look at the spread of innovation among state governments regarding financial,&lt;br/&gt;environmental, health, security, and other social problem domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Aspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to make three central contributions to the study of public policy diffusion.&lt;br/&gt;First, it will produce a database on the adoption of hundreds of policies in the American states, at&lt;br/&gt;least tripling the size of the largest database currently available and yielding a sample of policies&lt;br/&gt;that is more representative of the universe of policies for which states make laws. It will also&lt;br/&gt;leverage these new data to map and analyze the network pathways according to which policies&lt;br/&gt;diffuse (i.e., establish states that are leaders and followers in the diffusion of policies). As&lt;br/&gt;recently published research by the principal investigators shows, cutting-edge computational&lt;br/&gt;methods can be applied to large databases containing information on when policies were adopted&lt;br/&gt;by which governments in order to identify underlying networks along which policies persistently&lt;br/&gt;diffuse. Another key contribution from this research is to improve upon the existing method for&lt;br/&gt;inferring network ties in ways that are most suitable for policy diffusion research (as well as&lt;br/&gt;social science more generally) and implement it in a user-friendly package in the R statistical&lt;br/&gt;environment.

Mariam,,Aly,ma3631@columbia.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,03/01/2019,02/28/2025,889840.00,"Memory is a critical aspect of many of our behaviors. We use memory to find our way around, to detect a familiar face in a crowd, and to keep track of our ideas as we speak and write. One powerful way that memory can affect so many of our behaviors is by helping to guide what we pay attention to. For example, in a messy kitchen, you can use your memory for where mugs are typically stored in order to find one. Therefore, although memory is often studied for its own sake - for example, to understand how we are able to reminisce about the past, or how that process can go wrong - it is also critically important to understand how we can use memory in the service of guiding our attention and actions. The goal of this project is to understand how the functioning of the human brain enables us to use memories of the past to direct our attention, and the consequences that has for how quickly and accurately we can accomplish tasks. In doing so, this work will highlight the critical importance of memory for moment-to-moment attention. This will fill an important gap in scientific research, which often studies attention and memory in isolation. It will highlight the fundamentally interactive nature of our past and current experiences, with implications for how learning and remembering in educational settings can affect attention and future learning in a feedback loop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project therefore seeks to determine the neural mechanisms by which memories guide attention, focusing on the memories stored in a key brain region that is critical for building new memories and retrieving old ones: the hippocampus. This will be accomplished in two Aims, which use multiple methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging, studies of patients with brain lesions, eye tracking, and measures of behavioral accuracy and response times. In Aim 1, the project will determine the neural circuits for memory-guided attention and their relationship to behavior. The main hypothesis is that a brain network including the hippocampus and prefrontal and visual cortices allows us to use memory to update attentional goals and anticipate task-relevant information before it appears. This hypothesis will be tested using a novel approach of characterizing interactions between brain regions (representational connectivity), which&lt;br/&gt;enables investigation of synchrony in information content between regions. In Aim 2, this project will establish how memory and attention jointly guide visual exploration. The main hypothesis is that hippocampal memory retrieval of prior attentional goals will influence visual exploration, attention, and memory in novel situations. This work will have innovative implications for education, e.g., the use of eye tracking to identify if students are remembering and attending to relevant information, even if they cannot&lt;br/&gt;verbally describe it. Together, these two Aims will start to uncover the powerful way that memories can influence our in-the-moment attentional behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Vesall,,Nourani,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities,08/15/2018,07/31/2021,143000.00,"This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and supported by SBE's Economics program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Abhijit Banerjee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist studying the ways in which a novel pedagogical approach can influence teacher ability and effort and student learning outcomes. Ensuring quality teaching is a challenge around the world, so it is natural to ask: how can teacher quality and effort be improved? Attempts to answer this question by using material incentives (e.g., increased salaries or increased pay for performance outcomes) have not produced definitive answers. The fellow and sponsoring scientist have partnered with an NGO that implements a novel teacher training to gain insights into the multifaceted challenge of increasing teacher motivation and ability. The teacher training instils in teachers a love of learning by deepening their appreciation and understanding of the scientific method. By gaining the ability to practice methods of scientific inquiry, teachers begin to see both themselves and their students as scientists with the responsibility of building on accumulated knowledge to provide benefits to local communities. They thus become researchers with a social mission to apply and generate learned and, respectively, new knowledge to improve student and community outcomes. A core hypothesis of the study is that teachers' love of learning is transferred to students through a new orientation towards knowledge and its potential uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research employs a randomized control trial design to establish causal linkages between the teacher training and relevant outcomes. Fifty schools out of 100 are randomly selected to send teachers to participate in the teacher training. The study will compare outcomes in treatment and control schools to test hypotheses using originally collected datasets that include information on teacher attitudes, student learning and community outcomes. The study will be among the first to advance understanding about sources of intrinsic motivations in teachers and how they can be tapped to create qualitative and quantitative improvements to teacher quality and student learning. This is a significant contribution - studies examining links between teacher effort and monetary incentives often lead to outcomes that do not correlate with student learning. Additionally, the study will explore whether the pedagogical approach from the training leads teachers, and subsequently students, to apply knowledge to influence local community processes. Such an experience may lead to more creative economic activity, deeper engagement in civic processes. Thus, a second contribution of the study is that it demonstrates the ways in which different pedagogical approaches generate local and immediate returns to education in addition to delayed returns stemming from human capital investments the leads to workforce participation later in life. A second goal of the fellowship is to examine how nation-wide teacher training and recruitment strategies can tap into such sources of motivation to influence teacher quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Population surveys have attempted to understand evacuation principally in terms of the socio-demographic characteristics of those who do and do not evacuate. Data collected on evacuation estimates over the last two decades indicate that about one-third of residents in evacuation zones fail to evacuate. Despite this, there is no clear or standardized set of evacuation rationales, making it difficult to generalize across studies and regions. This project will explore whether a new set of methods for evaluating evacuation decisions can be replicated across regions and storms, in order to better predict evacuation decisions. Findings will be disseminated to organizations that explore and manage the causes, consequences, and complexities of disaster management and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award supports the collection of time-sensitive data concerning mandatory evacuation for Hurricane Irma in Florida. In order to get reliable reports concerning motives and beliefs about evacuation, interviews must be conducted in a context where respondents can form the appropriate associative cognitive state related to anthropogenic events necessary for free-listing exercises. This also needs to be conducted before another storm occurs. The researchers will use interviewing techniques from anthropology to collect reasons for evacuation/non-evacuation. Interviews will be conducted with neighbor-pairs (one who did and one did not evacuate) in both higher and lower storm risk zones (20 pairs) to elicit reasons for evacuating or not evacuating. Neighbor-matching is important to control for extraneous factors (such as wealth or distance from water) that might influence evacuation. Recent research suggests that free-list interviews are far more productive than standard open-ended questions. The researchers' previous work, successfully used free-listing to obtain a comprehensive set of evacuation/non-evacuation rationales on Hurricane Ike, in Galveston, Texas. The data collected in this project would improve the robustness, reliability, and replicability of these methodologies and models across evacuation contexts. If the data is replicable, the project would constitute a methodological innovation for anthropology specifically, and for disaster-related science more generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both technical and conceptual limits have prevented the collection and analysis of rich empirical datasets with high temporal frequency over large spatial extents necessary to investigate how changes to seasonal precipitation patterns are affecting food security.  This research project will transform both methodological and conceptual frameworks for assessing the sustainability of dryland agricultural systems.  The research will bring new understanding of how dryland farmers adapt to within-season variability in climate and how those adaptations affect their current and future resilience to climate variability and climate change.  Project findings will improve forecast models used to monitor and predict the sustainability of water-dependent agricultural systems.  By marrying the simple idea of cell phone adoption with state-of-art research in data science, crop prediction, and environmental/social monitoring, the project will advance and accelerate scientific understanding of an important global sustainability problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on characterizing the nature and impact of intra-seasonal smallholder decision making on adaptation to climate variability in semi-arid agricultural systems. Specifically, the research addresses three critical research questions: (1) How do intra-seasonal dynamics of both the environment and social systems shape farmer adaptive capacity? (2) To what extent does intra-seasonal decision making enable farmers to adapt to climate uncertainty? and (3) How can intra-seasonal data improve the ability to model, predict, and improve adaptation to climate variability in ways that enhance food security?  The research team will integrate physical models of hydrological and agricultural dynamics with real-time environmental data and weekly farmer decision making in individual fields.  These real-time data are obtained from previously-developed novel cellular-based environmental sensing pods coupled to real-time reports of farmer decision making submitted via cell phones.  The team will use a combination of environmental and social data to develop a suite of modeling tools for understanding how climate variability impacts the sustainability of agricultural systems in the study regions.  The research team also will develop modeling tools for improved forecasts of food security capable of producing new understandings of the intra-seasonal dynamics of both social and environmental processes.

One reason for this difficulty is that different speakers have different accents, so two speakers might pronounce the same word differently (e.g. 'car' in American versus British English), while pronouncing different words identically (e.g. 'gloss' in American English can sound identical to a Londoner's 'glass'). While humans are typically able to adapt to these accent differences, little is known about how this adaptation works. A further puzzle is how humans adapt to accents socially: listeners can improve not only in how well they understand a new accent, but also in how well they use the subtleties of that accent to pick up on a speaker's social characteristics. For example, many Americans cannot distinguish between accents from the north versus south of England, or between upper-class and working-class British accents, but upon moving to the UK can learn to make such distinctions. Again, little is understood about how this adaptation works. This project investigates how listeners adapt to accents over time--both in terms of how well they can understand an accent and in their social knowledge about that accent--and explores the relationship between these two types of adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term adaptation to accents is investigated by comparing how Americans in the US versus Americans living in the UK process southern British English. The project focuses on words like 'bath', 'grass', and 'pass' which are pronounced with ""short-a"" (the vowel in 'cat') in American English but with ""long-ah"" (the vowel in 'father') in southern British English. It investigates: (1) how well do Americans know which words have ""long-ah"" in southern British English? (2) how does this knowledge change as they gain more experience with British English? and (3) what does this tell us about their mental representations of British accents? Americans in the US and UK, along with a control group of British participants, will be recruited for several perception experiments. Crucial items will include words that are similar to long-ah words, but pronounced with ""short-a"" in British English. For example, 'grass' and 'gas' rhyme in American English, so if 'grass' is pronounced with long-ah in southern British English, one might expect 'gas' to also be pronounced with long-ah--but, in fact, southern British speakers pronounce 'gas' with short-a. Do Americans know that short-a is the correct British pronunciation, or do they incorrectly generalize from 'grass' to 'gas'?  If Americans hear 'gas' with long-ah, do they think it sounds refined and British--or do they know that it sounds like someone faking an accent? Comparing the answers to these questions for listeners with different amounts of exposure to British English will tell us what kinds of linguistic generalizations listeners make as they adapt, which will provide an important step in understanding how humans are so easily able to adapt to new accents, and may inform technological advances in language processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When public programs and private financial resources both recede, what kinds of social resources do chronically ill people, who need stable access to pharmaceuticals, mobilize in order to survive? Social scientific accounts of unmet healthcare needs associated with economic crises have largely focused on the developing world. Less is known about the relationship between austerity and healthcare resources in contexts such as the U.S. or Europe. This research addresses pharmaceutical access under austerity in a context with a previously robust universal healthcare system. Deepening financial and healthcare inequalities associated with economic crisis have given way to newly disenfranchised people that must seek pharmaceuticals in a therapeutic economy characterized by frequent crisis-driven reformulations. This research, which is centered on training a graduate student in rigorous methods of scientific data collection and analysis, seeks to understand the kinds of social resources people mobilize in order to address unmet pharmaceutical needs, when public healthcare is no longer dependable and financial resources and pharmaceuticals are unevenly distributed. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student, the project would improve scientific understanding through broadly disseminating its findings to governmental and non-governmental organizations charged with improving public health access, as they mediate the differential impacts of austerity on healthcare outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Taylor Bell, under the supervision of Dr. Cristiana Giordano of the University of California at Davis, will explore what forms of social networks replace public infrastructures under conditions of austerity in healthcare access. This research takes place in Athens, Greece, which has instituted the most stringent austerity measures targeting public healthcare across Europe. Athens has the highest concentration of state-sponsored healthcare resources in Greece, and so, will best highlight how people adjust pharmaceutical-seeking practices when public resources disappear. In order to learn how pharmaceuticals are exchanged and the relationships that facilitate these exchanges, the co-PI will conduct participant observation in emergent grassroots solidarity clinics and pharmacies, which many people turned to after austerity measures eroded the universal healthcare system, cutting its budget by more than 50%. The co-PI will also track, map, and analyze pharmaceutical networks and therapeutic economies through a range of observational and archival methods on extended social networks, as well as interviews (through both the McGill Illness Narrative Interview, and well as targeted semi-structured follow-ups) with a representative sample of pharmaceutical seekers. The findings will contribute to debates in medical, political, and economic anthropology about inequality, specifically in the differential distribution of healthcare burdens under conditions of economic austerity. This research offers insight to policymakers concerned with the kinds of social resources that disenfranchised, chronically ill people build in order to establish access to needed pharmaceuticals, as state-funded healthcare retracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Amazon Basin located in the heart of tropical South America and stretching from the Atlantic ocean to the Andes is an area approximately the size of the continental United States. It is presently home to the largest contiguous expanse of American tropical forest and it contains much of what remains of the New World's indigenous cultural and biological diversity. Numerous studies show how this diversity is ancient, its species-rich forests being tens of millions of years ago and its native cultures dating to first human entrance of the Americas 15,000 years ago. Understanding how past patterns of natural- and human-caused alterations of the Amazonian forest affected its biology and cultures, including still in the present time, is therefore of considerable importance to environmental historians, archaeologists, climate modelers, and conservation biologists alike. For example, organizations increasingly rely on such information to formulate good policies, including by better understanding species resilience in the face of significant disturbance. With this research, the researchers will undertake reconstructions of vegetation and fire history across five different regions of Amazonia through analysis and dating of plant fossils that they have sampled from directly underneath present-day forests. The researchers will provide sensitive indices of both cultural and natural influences on past and modern forest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will carry out phytolith and charcoal analyses on terrestrial soils sampled from remote, previously unstudied regions and areas of western Amazonia where they have hypothesized human impacts were less significant than in other regions. The problems addressed in this research are of high interest to, and align with important questions from diverse scholarly disciplines focused on human/environmental relationships with the present and future Amazon as well as its past. Conservation, sustainability, and reforestation programs are more successful if environmental histories are understood, and these programs are also extremely important to modern indigenous societies who seek to utilize well their natural resources. Climate modelers and forecasters require more information about the effects of prehistoric activities on past atmospheres, so that they can better model the links between present and future atmospheric conditions and tropical/global environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These sites reflect not only a record of subsistence, but contain valuable information about the past environment and how people interacted with it and each other. Due to the difficulty in excavating and transporting large amounts of shell, invertebrates are typically not included in zooarchaeological analysis which results in a lack of comparative data on the composition of vertebrates and invertebrates in shell matrix sites. This interdisciplinary research combines zooarchaeology and stable isotope geochemistry to understand the role of shellfish in the processes and practices that led to the formation of shell ring sites on the coastal southeastern US. As a prominent component of shell rings, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) will be the focus of a season of capture study that uses modern environmental data as a proxy for past environmental conditions. Further, understanding use patterns of oysters in the past has important implications for the management and conservation of the species today. Given the decline in oyster populations world-wide, archaeology is uniquely situated to provide a long-term, historical perspective on the human impact on the coast and the health and sustainability of its important resources. Results of this research will be shared globally, including a web-based guide outlining preparation techniques for geochemical analysis of oysters, implications of the findings for estuarine health, and value for archaeological research. Undergraduate student participants in the project will gain laboratory experience and training in zooarchaeological methods and stable isotope analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shell rings are a class of shell-matrix site in which form and function have been variously theorized as the products of either habitation, ceremonial practice or a combination of the two. Central to these theories is seasonality, wherein ceremonial sites would likely demonstrate seasonal use when compared to year-round habitation sites. Faunal remains are typically used to address the seasonal nature of these sites, however invertebrate remains are rarely included in analysis, limiting our understanding of combined vertebrate and invertebrate faunal use patterns. Under the direction of Dr. Susan deFrance, Co-PI Nicole Cannarozzi will investigate the differential formation and use of two Late Archaic Period Shell rings located on St. Catherines Island, Georgia by comparing the stable isotopic composition of the carbonate in modern and archaeological oysters from these sites. Over a two-year period, the Co-PI collected oysters and water samples from St. Catherines Island and measured water temperature and salinity. These data will be coupled with a comprehensive zooarchaeological analysis of vertebrates and invertebrates from column samples taken from various contexts within the two sites to understand faunal use, settlement patterns and depositional practices. This study highlights the value of interdisciplinary research in archaeology and will clarify our understanding of the timing of formation of shell matrix sites, faunal resource use and seasonal settlement and mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many people perceive women who take partner names as selfless, and women who keep their birth names as individualistic. This project will examine how marital name norms may evolve by identifying the conditions under which norm-breakers are given more leniency. The project examines whether women and men who are middle-class or working-class, women and men who are primary breadwinners or secondary breadwinners, and women and men who do or do not plan to have children are viewed differently when they make unconventional marital name decisions, e.g., when women keep their names or when men hyphenate their names. Findings will add nuance to public discourse about marriage equality by showing how the public views unconventional actions, how female and male characteristics shape the consequences they face, and how views of name choice speak to larger public discourses about gender equality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes three survey experiments to examine whether and how economic resources and parental status change the effect that marital name choice has on views of women and men. Respondents will evaluate the female and male likability, dominance, interpersonal hostility, femininity and masculinity, perceived parenting ability and answer open-ended questions assessing their approval of marital name decisions. Qualtrics, an online survey platform that recruits respondents, will collect data for each experiment. The first study will examine whether and, if so, how views of norm-breakers differ based on gender and social class. Hypotheses suggest that middle-class women and men may have more freedom to break the norm because middle-class Americans are viewed more positively than working-class Americans. The second study will examine how perceptions of norm-breakers differ based on relative income, in addition to gender and class. Hypotheses suggest that individuals who are primary earners in their relationships may have more bargaining power and leverage to break norms. The third study examines how views of norm-breakers differ based on parental status, and how this relationship may vary by gender and class. Hypotheses suggest that gender norms will be more rigid when a couple has children, so women may have less flexibility to break name norms if they express plans to have children. Each of the three experiments randomly assigns respondents to conditions that systematically vary the respondent marital name choice (woman takes name of husband, both keep names, both hyphenate), gender (woman, man), as well as class (working/middle-class; Study 1), relative income (woman/man primary earner; Study 2) and parental status (plan/do not plan to have children; Study 3).

With the deindustrialization of the Midwestern United States, individuals within these communities have taken a range of measures to ensure the security of their economic, physiological, and community wellbeing. This project, which provides funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate what role security plays in gauging the potential that the future holds for small rural towns. To understand the lived effects of recent shifts in industry and economic restructuring, the project will explore how such global processes are reflected in the objects that make up homes, and speak to the changing nature of sociocultural dynamics therein.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Briel Kobak, under the supervision of Dr. Shannon Dawdy of the University of Chicago, will explore what factors motivate consumer behavior as it relates to issues of security, and what significant social and cultural identities are associated with the consumption, collection, and curation of objects that afford personal safety. Taking the classic analytical approach of the object biography, this research will be conducted by tracing the circulation of security objects in and around a small town in Southern Indiana, and asking how certain dangers and insecurities are articulated and remediated along the way. Using a mixed approach of ethnographic, archaeological, and archival methods, the researcher asks what role these objects play in terms of providing a sense of security that is material, affective, and economic. By investigating practices of security as they have historically also become related to individual consumer behavior, the project moves studies of security beyond the study of formal institutional frameworks, to the more local, quotidian contexts where they are experienced. The project will make significant contributions to theories of security, and economic anthropological debates around consumption and commodities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the features of Sora's sound system, grammar and vocabulary which stand out in various significant ways, both from related languages and other languages of the region. These analyses will inform (and be informed by) current debates in language contact and language change in the South Asian and Southeast Asian regions, as well as by current work in linguistic typology, and may necessitate a reformulation of the prehistory of South Asia. Sora presents several challenging features, including a possibly unique form of noun incorporation that has been explicitly predicted to be impossible. Once these details of Sora are better understood, and its changes over time have been analyzed, new insights into the murky linguistic pre-history of South Asia will emerge. The project also offers unique opportunities for indigenous scientists to play major roles in the research as key team members, thus offering capacity building and STEM field research opportunities to some of the most underserved and underrepresented communities of scientists. It also helps promote the visibility of indigenous peoples whose histories have been missing from mainstream accounts of regional South Asian history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce A Grammar of Sora (with texts, a comparative lexicon and grammar of the various Sora dialects) and create an exhaustive, annotated archival deposit of the Sora dialect materials. These are to be collected through a combination of spontaneous narrative recordings and targeted elicitation with speakers, recorded in audio and video format. Topics to be explored include the 'expressive' lexicon, which is a highly developed system in Sora with many attested complex reduplication patterns, as well as the systems of grammatical agreement seen in different verb classes. We will also examine the typological shifts that may have accompanied the Dravidian and Aryan migrations into South Asia that marginalized the groups already there, such as the Proto-Munda ancestors to the Sora, and the ancestral language to Kusunda to the periphery. These typological shifts may have submerged or replaced what may have been more widespread older features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New faces may remind us of someone we already know. Smells and tastes can make us think back to earlier times.  More broadly, new stimuli (i.e. sounds, tastes, smells, or sights) can make us think back to something we already know.  When we encounter new problems or information, we often rely upon our prior knowledge to help us solve the new problem or understand the new information. ""Remindings"" are when new information brings back to mind related, prior experienced episodes.  These remindings sometimes happen when we do not want them (e.g., mindwandering) and fail to happen when they would be useful (e.g., neglecting to notice a relationship between a current problem and a previously solved one).  This project will examine why remindings help memory, what makes remindings happen, and how remindings help us to create knowledge that we can use in many situations.  Understanding how remindings operate will show how the mind is structured and how memory works.  Further, this research may show how students can learn new information efficiently and effectively.  Therefore, the project will include high school teachers and help them incorporate research-based practices into their classrooms to support student learning.  Undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will develop their skills as researchers, teachers, and presenters through this research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remindings, stimulus-guided retrievals of past specific episodes, are a fundamental component of cognition that are theorized to underlie a broad array of vital cognitive skills, including problem solving, categorization, frequency judgments, and even number representation.  The nine experiments involved with this project will answer three questions: what cognitive processes underlie remindings, what stimulus characteristics influence whether remindings occur, and what are the consequences of remindings on generalizing category knowledge.  Learners will study lists of related and unrelated paired stimuli, including words, sentences, and declarative concepts.  The relations among studied information and lag between presentations will be experimentally manipulated to affect the amount and consequence of remindings.  Learners' memory for studied stimuli and their ability to transfer their knowledge to new situations will be tested.  Understanding remindings has great theoretical importance, but it also has significant practical importance, as processes underlying remindings can be used to benefit students' memory and generalization across learning materials.  For example, theories of reminding implicate retrieval practice and elaboration processes (both of which boost student learning in authentic settings).  Through presentations, workshops, and education cafes, high school teachers will learn how cognitive processes underlying remindings can impact student learning, and will create lesson plans based around these cognitive processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While low labor productivity is the cause of poverty and its transmission to future generation, economists know very little about the causes of low labor productivity among the poor.  This research project will combine insights from psychology and economics, sophisticated economic theory, and experimental methods to study the sources and consequences of low labor productivity among the poor.  This experimental research will be carried out in three different settings, thus making the results generalizable.  Each of the three projects will try to answer a specific development question: individual's labor productivity, people's ability to save and smooth out consumption, and total productivity in the economy. The results of this research will provide a better understanding of the sources of low labor productivity among low income people.  In so doing, the results could provide powerful inputs into policies to increase productivity, hence decrease poverty in the U.S. and around the world.  This could also lead to increased labor productivity, faster economic growth, and improved living standards for U.S. citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project advances the literatures in development and behavioral economics. The proposal consists of three projects.  Each project links missing markets to distortions in productivity in a low income  setting. The first project tests whether redistributive arrangements, considered a response to missing insurance markets, dampen labor supply and productivity. It will use a field experiment to examine whether enabling workers to convert earnings gains into long run savings, leads to increases in worker output and earnings. This would provide the first evidence for such distortive effects of redistributive pressure in a natural field setting. The second project seeks to provide the first piece of evidence for the role of cognitive constraints on consumption smoothening, helping to explain violations of the permanent income hypothesis. It uses a field experiment to test whether interventions that lower the cognitive costs of planning improve consumption smoothing and output. The third project advances the development literature on both separation failures and factor misallocation by directly testing whether labor rationing is a cause of factor misallocation.  Each of these projects highlight how the presence of missing markets can exacerbate underdevelopment.

The U.S. Forest Service has been tasked with including the variety of benefits individuals and society obtain from ecosystems, often called ecosystem services, in National Forest planning and decision-making. While the concept aims to directly link environmental decision-making with human wellbeing, there is little guidance on how to collect and include data related to human wellbeing and cultural values in ecosystem service-based management. A first step in giving more attention to wellbeing and cultural values through an ecosystem services framework is to better understand the diverse ways National Forest lands are used and valued by different stakeholder groups. This research will provide data and demonstrate methods that can be used to fulfill statutory requirements for National Forest planning going forward, while allowing stakeholder groups to provide input into public lands management. Furthermore, results will be shared with the Forest Service and presented to stakeholder groups, improving understanding of priorities and highlighting values that are shared among groups.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>While the concept of ecosystem services has risen in prominence as a decision-making framework over the last two decades, analysis has often focused on few, easily quantifiable services rather than the more difficult to quantify cultural benefits that individuals and society may value most. This research will address this knowledge gap through the development of participatory approaches for identifying, valuing, and mapping ecosystem services that will link the concept with the resource use, cultural values, and livelihoods of diverse stakeholder groups. First, investigation of which ecosystem services are identified, used, prioritized, and most valued by different stakeholder groups will be conducted through semi-structured interviews. Secondly, participants will engage in a participatory mapping exercise focused on understanding the spatial patterns of the uses and values they have identified across the landscape, which will be input into geographic information system software and analyzed. Finally, these place-based findings uncovered from participatory engagement with multiple groups will be compared with non-participatory methods for ecosystem service assessment, including spatial models of ecosystem service provision and results from semi-structured interviews with forest managers that uncover institutional ecosystem service priorities.

Peer-review is used to identify quality scientific work and as such is the mechanism by which the scientific community regulates itself.  Science, however, does not take place in a vacuum. The possibility of bias from known characteristics such as gender, name, title, or nationality has led to frequent and recurrent calls that the evaluation of scientific work should follow a double-blind review process (where the identities of both the reviewers and the authors are withheld) rather than a single-blind review process (where the identities of the reviewer are withheld but not the authors). Yet, there are strong arguments for the use of single-blind review, including that it is difficult to truly conceal the identity of the authors and that their identities may serve as a valid cue for the quality of the work. The project will compare the outcomes from single- and double-blind reviews of talks included on the program of a national conference. The experiment will examine how well each review process predicts highly rated talks (accuracy) and whether the reviewers show preferences for author characteristics unrelated to talk quality (bias). The project will provide evidence-based recommendations for review procedures that facilitate an efficient, fair, and impartial review process.

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. U.S. families are changing, reflecting the rapid economic, political, demographic, and technological transformation of society and forecasting the future. These changes can be seen in how adults partner and have children as well as evolving norms of gender relations, children's experiences, and extended networks of support and obligation. Changes in family life is, in turn, intricately related to the diversification of the U.S. population as a result of increased immigration over many decades coupled with differential fertility across racial/ethnic groups. In many ways, changes in family behaviors are adaptive for all Americans. The implications of these changes, however, play out differently across racial/ethnic groups. To understand how family change is differentially experienced across diverse segments of the U.S. population, how racial/ethnic diversity accelerates or slows family change, and how racialized family change reflects, reinforces, and reduces broader patterns of inequality and discrimination, the field of family demography needs to train and support a new generation of scholars who can produce theoretically grounded and methodologically rigorous knowledge and use it to inform policy and practice.

SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Sandra D. Simpkins at the University of California, Irvine, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist exploring high-quality and culturally responsive, math afterschool program (ASP) practices for under-represented minority (URM) youth. Mathematical proficiency is the foundation of youth's STEM pursuits. Yet today, far too many youth do not pursue STEM based on a perception that they are ""not good at math"". Students need to engage in contexts that spark their interest and their continued mastery and growth. ASPs are settings for such dynamic opportunities, particularly for URM students such as Latinos who attend lower quality schools and do not feel supported. In college, URM students often struggle with uninspiring and culturally incongruent STEM learning environments. The intergenerational nature of university-based STEM ASPs, whereby younger students are paired with undergraduate (UG) mentors, are opportunities to support both K-12 and UG students' motivational beliefs in math and STEM more broadly. This project will examine these intergenerational developmental processes in the context of a math enrichment ASP located at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. By studying how ASPs can serve as an important lever for promoting URM students' access and success in STEM, this project seeks to meaningfully inform efforts to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand how participating in a math enrichment ASP supports both youth participants' and UG mentors' motivational beliefs in math; to describe high-quality and culturally responsive practices; and to understand how to support the effectiveness of youth-staff relationships. To accomplish these research objectives, data will be collected from both youth participants and UG mentors through multiple methods including surveys, in-depth interviews, participant-observations, and video observations of youth-staff interactions. This project will add to our understanding of university-ASP partnerships. Further, the knowledge gained from this study will impact the larger landscape of practice and research on STEM ASPs by 1) addressing critical gaps in the current literature on high-quality and culturally responsive STEM ASP practices and 2) informing ASP staff development training. Overall, this mixed methods project will provide critical and rich information on the ways that ASPs can effectively deliver on its promise of promoting positive development for all youth, especially URM youth who may need and benefit from these spaces the most. The invaluable insight garnered from this study will be disseminated to traditional academic audiences to advance knowledge, as well as to local, state, and national organizations to inform the larger landscape of practice in STEM ASPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This means that roughly one in six Colombians is recognized by the state as a victim of violence. This project proposes an investigation into the politics of victimhood in Colombia?s transitional context: Why are some victim claims seen as more legitimate than others in the eyes of the state, human rights actors, and conflict-affected individuals? How does the state produce the category of victim through its bureaucratic processes and how must conflict-affected individuals perform it in order to receive recognition and access benefits? And what are the implications of these constructed hierarchies for theories and experiences of justice during transitions from violence? These questions apply not only to the Colombian peace process, but also to justice dilemmas that arise in transitions from armed conflict worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through interviews and discourse analysis, the project aims to understand how different actors who influence conflict-affected individuals? experiences of justice make sense of their power. Ethnographic observation will shed light on what the status of ?victim? means to those who vie for it or refuse it. It will also examine what individuals have to do to become recognizable as victims in the eyes of the law and the state. The goal of this inquiry into the evolution of the status of victims as political actors is not to reify this category, but to interrogate it and explore its political use by various actors during transitions from violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It presented an accessible summary of star lore based upon a now lost work of Eudoxus, and it was an immediate and lasting success as an introductory text to astronomy; an immense exegetical literature grew up around it. This literature included commentaries written by both experts in astronomy, such as Hipparchus, and non-expert authors, as well as scholia (marginal notes) written in copies of his work. The project will explore the reception of Aratus's work among later commentators, and compare the way that the latter read, understood, and interacted with this text and the astronomy it contained. Results of this project will be made public through a dedicated website which will make available ancient texts with modern English translations for the first time; they will be made accessible through an innovative and open access online platform that will display the text of Aratus and of its commentaries and scholia, along with interactive visualizations of the astronomy they contain. In addition, the PI will produce a scholarly monograph on Hipparchus' commentary to Aratus, and she will develop an exhibition and new courses on ancient astronomy and history of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a pioneering investigation in history of science. It has four main goals. It will bring Aratus and his under-appreciated exegetical community to light, study the commentary of Hipparchus under the light of the debate about the nature of science and of the best genres to disseminate it, discuss the ancient reception of Aratus among different types of readership, and discuss the different genres of scientific writing in antiquity. The authors of these ancient texts form an understudied community of thinkers, who held widely varying opinions on Aratus' status as an authority on astronomy. The project will highlight this forgotten intellectual world, and it will broaden the traditional canon of ancient authors by translating many of these texts into modern English for the first time and making them freely available through an online digital portal. One key figure under investigation in the project is Hipparchus, who responds to Aratus and with whom Ptolemy deeply engages; understanding this missing intellectual link is critical to studies of ancient science. The PI will produce an edition and commentary on Hipparchus' commentary to Aratus that will be published as an independent, scholarly monograph. The project is also innovative for its social history of scientific writing and of commentary as a genre; the authors of these texts were all writing sciences but using very different genres and media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A main tool for estimating such structural models is inference via simulation.  For different parametrizations of the model, synthetic data is generated via the model, and the parameters generating data that most closely resembles observed data are used as estimates. Recent modern artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning for image recognition are based on this same principle. These methods have been achieving impressive results over the past years. Therefore, this research takes advantage of such powerful tools in modern pattern recognition for structural estimation in economics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research considers a set-up where individual outcomes are a known function of exogenous variables and an error whose distribution is known up to a finite dimensional vector of parameters. The goal is to estimate the finite dimensional parameter. The investigators adopt the generative adversarial network approach (GANs) to find the parameter value such that given a discriminator, a device that can accurately distinguish data generated using the model from real data, is unable to do so when the data is generated according to such parameter value. The method developed in this research differs from other simulation-based minimum distance estimators in that the distance is adaptive. That is, the discriminator learns the features of the data that are best at distinguishing real from synthetic data as opposed to hard-coding what features of the data to match. This adaptability property has proven powerful in pattern recognition tasks. In structural estimation, adaptability can translate into alleviating the curse of dimensionality, and obtaining parameters that are able to more closely match entire distributions of data, as opposed to a set of pre-specified moments. This estimation framework should be useful in applications were distributional effects and heterogeneity are first order to evaluate the effect of a particular policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Charles,A,Berrey,caberrey@hawaii.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,08/15/2018,07/31/2024,123185.00,"Systems of raised agricultural fields covering many square kilometers were constructed by prehistoric societies in numerous parts of the world. These fields, which consist of elevated platforms or ridges and excavated canals, represent the earliest and most substantial forms of prehistoric landscape modification undertaken in many regions; their emergence marks an important shift in modes of economic production and labor organization. In the broad sweep of human history these agricultural projects were important early steps toward many of the organizational, technological, and engineering developments that underpin modern society, and archaeological research has revealed a great deal of variation in the types of social, political, economic, and demographic conditions under which they came to develop. This variation raises important questions as to how and why human societies first decided to undertake large-scale landscape modification projects in the prehistoric past. What, for instance, were the forces that prompted the emergence of raised-field agriculture in different world regions? Were they environmental, demographic, or political in nature? And what impact did this new mode of economic production have on other aspects of social, economic, and political life? In a world where large-scale landscape modification projects provide the economic and infrastructural foundation on which society is built, and often with great consequence to local populations, such questions are of particular relevance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. C. Adam Berrey, of the University of Hawaii, along with colleagues and students from Panama and Colombia, will undertake research to study to the social, political, economic, and demographic dynamics of raised-field agriculture among early complex societies in the Rio Bayano valley of eastern Panama. It was among these types of societies that the earliest forms of social inequality, economic specialization, and large-scale social formations first began to emerge, making them a particularly interesting context in which to evaluate the emergence of raised-field agriculture. How might the emergence of raised-field agriculture, for example, connected to the new forms of social and economic relationships, and the larger scales of integration, that were emerging at this time? To answer this and the questions enumerated above, Dr. Berrey will lead a team of archaeologists to study the development of early complex society in the Rio Bayano valley, from the very beginnings of a sedentary, agricultural lifeway to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century. Regional and local-scale survey will be carried out to study the changing demographic conditions of the region, while local survey and excavation will generate household artifact assemblages with which it will be possible to study changing social and economic relationships. Of particular interest will be to examine if and how these social, economic, and demographic conditions changed during and after the emergence of raised-field agriculture. This research will generate new comparative data and methods for the study of raised-field agriculture and early complex society development, and will provide educational and training opportunities for students and other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such diversity includes both the social position of the worker and type of work they do. The research will examine how diverse workers interact with volunteers in their efforts to reduce poverty. The research will examine the extent to which such interactions influence NGOs to change their project goals, and will examine the new kinds of work these interactions produce. Volunteer tourism is a rapidly expanding transnational phenomenon, and this study will provide insights into how it transforms volunteers who travel abroad, NGO operations, and development project outcomes. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will apply a geographic analysis of transnational voluntourism by shifting the scale of development research from the typical macro level analysis of policies or trade to the micro level, with a focus on people, homes, and offices. The study will use an ethnographic approach to examine how daily work by diverse workers at an NGO shape how such organizations function at multiple scales including institutional, interpersonal, and at the project scale. The research will seek answers to the following questions: (1) what is the relationship between labor dynamics, NGO practices, and funding?; (2) what are the experiences of volunteers, workers, and beneficiaries of NGOs?; and (3) how do the labor dynamics and experiences impact both livelihoods and development outcomes of poverty reduction projects?. The student will collect data through a multi-faceted approach including participant observation, semi-structured and informal interviews; content analysis of annual reports; and post-trip email surveys of volunteers. While this research focuses on development projects in Guatemala, it will provide new insights regarding the impacts of American volunteer tourism on people and development NGOs, with implications for improving volunteer tourism and development practices both in the US and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will not only generate detailed data on faunal and botanical remains to advance archaeological theory, but will also provide time depth and comparative data for understanding modern societal challenges related to food and inequality. The project will support and strengthen international scientific collaborations and student training in STEM research. Public and community science outreach and conservation of local historical heritage will also be fostered through community and researcher collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon recent calls by scholars to develop a more social approach to the archaeological study of food practices, including consideration of the relationship between people and food in everyday and ritual settings within a social and cultural system.  The investigators will address the relationship between food and social organization through a thorough analysis of exceptionally well-preserved faunal and botanical remains of an early village in the Mixteca Alta of Oaxaca, Mexico. The archaeological site of Etlatongois is temporally situated at the dawn of social complexity in the Oaxacan region of Mesoamerica, ca. 1000 BC. Zooarchaeological and paleoethnobotanical analyses will be carried out in one of the largest faunal and floral samples ever excavated for the region, in terms of volume of material pertaining to a single time period.

Because of their unique colors, behaviors, and their ability to fly, birds in particular have been one of the most symbolically important types of animals throughout time. This is especially true in the prehistoric Americas, where the study of their remains from archaeological sites can help address questions concerning prehistoric ritual and religion. Katelyn Bishop, a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles, will examine prehistoric Pueblo ritual and religion through an analysis of the use and ideological significance of birds in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico between AD 850-1150. Ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological research have demonstrated the centrality of birds in Pueblo ritual and cosmology; avifaunal remains, which are frequently under-studied, should therefore be considered strong indicators of ritual practice, the analysis of which can speak to ideological perceptions and belief. The reconstruction of ritual practices in Chaco Canyon, a major social and ceremonial center in what is now New Mexico, during the Pueblo II period (AD 900-1150), will contextualize these traditions in the long development of Pueblo ritual and religion, and within broader regional context in the greater Southwest. The results of this research may have relevance to modern descendent communities, and can enrich the experience of visitors to the Chaco Canyon National Historical Park through the creation of an interpretive exhibit on the past and present importance of birds in the Pueblo world, and online material for those who cannot access the remote location of the park. This project will bring together material from widely disbursed institutions, and demonstrate the importance of bringing to light old and unpublished collections from historic excavations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the analysis of both avifaunal remains and the depiction of birds in art, Bishop seeks to address three major goals: (1) to understand the nature of ritual practice and ideologies that involved birds; (2) to understand how ritual was organized across the canyon, within and between multiple great houses and small sites; and (3) to examine change over time in the nature of ritual and its organization. In the process of achieving these goals, this project will synthesize all avifaunal remains and bird imagery from the nearly 130-year long history of excavation in the canyon. Bishop relies on the theoretical perspective of ritual as a form of social practice, where ritual is a dynamic activity that is both structured by and can restructure existing social and belief structures. This theoretical perspective makes it possible to understand what ritual practices may have looked like, and how they may have changed over time. She also employs ethnographically-based models to understand the organization of this ritual practice, with expectations derived from modern and historic organizational principles of ritual. Under the guidance of Dr. Gregson Schachner, Bishop's research will advance our understanding of Pueblo ritual and religion, the nature of the Chaco regional system, and the value of birds in prehistory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By defining a common framework to describe these signals, and their variability across space and time, the RCN will develop methods and tools applicable to a wide range of domains, including language, music, action, perception, and navigation. The RCN will build upon research in Neuromorphic Engineering and its development of bio-inspired, low-power computing platforms, sensors, and signal processing. Using these tools, the RCN will focus on high-level cognitive functions, to create complex, bio-inspired systems that learn through engagement in tasks. The network will bring together neuroscience, cognitive science, applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering, with emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Network members will participate in a yearly three-week, hands-on workshop, that will develop and test new tools and ideas, stimulate new collaborations, and educate students on unique interdisciplinary skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCN will facilitate interactions and collaborative projects among participating researchers employing a wide range of paradigms that specifically deal with three thrusts: the role of neural plasticity for learning symbolic systems; the adaptive mechanisms underlying the learning of sensory-motor tasks; and transitioning to real-world applications such as automatic speech and dynamic scene understanding, neuromorphic hardware implementations, cognitive computational algorithms, and databases acquisition. Specific examples of such diverse projects include brain process models that assess learning and expertise; algorithms, based on physiological or abstract events, that process input from neuromorphic hardware; and development of software and neuromorphic hardware for signal interpretation and action execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through fieldwork in the region, the investigators will obtain genealogical data and DNA samples from ~1250 individuals living there. For these newly collected samples, and for ~700 previously collected samples from the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region, they will analyze mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal variation, including through whole genome sequencing. These data will be analyzed in conjunction with archeological, ethnological and linguistic evidence. Using this approach, a number of questions will be addressed, including: (a) the Paleolithic settlement of the Caucasus by modern humans; (b) the nature and extent of Neanderthal admixture in Georgian populations; (c) the degree to which local Caucasus populations have genetically influenced Eurasian populations; (d) the biological and cultural impact of the Neolithic spread of agriculture into the Caucasus; and (e) the interactions between Anatolian and Georgian populations over the past ten millennia. This project will generate some of the highest resolution mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal data currently available for Caucasus populations. Finally, these studies of contemporary Caucasus populations will lay the foundation for future ancient DNA analyses of past human populations from various locations and temporal contexts within the region, ones that will provide a clearer diachronic perspective on genetic variation in the Caucasus itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeology is well-positioned to provide insight regarding this topic due to its focus on extended periods of time and changes throughout these periods. Within this broader context, this project takes a long-term perspective on human-environment relationships to understand how humans have impacted their environment and the ways these interactions helped shape past societal development and collapse. This contribution is salient because it advances the scientific knowledge of the complex relationships between the development and collapse of society and a changing environment. The use of a resilience framework to understand the ecological dimensions of social transformations makes this research applicable across many scientific topics. Additionally, understanding past socioecological dynamics is relevant to modern issues of land-use and management, particularly those concerning biodiversity. Thus, studying the role of diversity in past tropical societies informs modern policy. This project involves collaboration with many entities including national and international academic professionals, undergraduate students from the United States, and individuals from Belize. Furthermore, results from this project will be used to inform community outreach efforts that focus on improving education and literacy in Belize and more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jason Yaeger and Ms. Rebecca Friedel, of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), will investigate the variables that influence the development and decline of complex societies using a diachronic examination of the intersection of human action with the biophysical world, or human-environment relationships. Using a resilience framework, this project focuses on a case study of societal development and decline in the Mopan River valley, Belize, to test the hypothesis that: the maintenance of high diversity is critical to the resilience of societies in the face of disruptions (e.g., climatic shifts). This hypothesis will be supported if this project finds that: 1) plant diversity is high before and during early climatic disruptions that did not cause a collapse and 2) plant diversity decreases leading up to a later societal collapse that correlates with a climatic disruption. In order to examine the nuances of this hypothesis, this project will study plant diversity dynamics and the human behaviors driving those dynamics using long-term datasets at both landscape and localized scales. Together, these paleoecological and archaeobotanical data will allow for a detailed understanding of human-environment relationships and their role in the resilience of complex social and ecological systems. By integrating these multiple datasets, the researchers will be able to evaluate the main hypothesis that the maintenance of high diversity is critical to the resilience of socioecological systems in the face of perturbations by answering our two research questions: how do the dynamics of plant diversity relate to known sociopolitical and climatic histories of the Mopan valley, and what human behaviors were driving those plant diversity dynamics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When exploring a new city, tourists often wander through the streets, with the goal of visiting individual sites and taking in specific views. Through this wandering, they gain an understanding of the network of the city streets. When returning to their hotel, they are unlikely to retrace their steps. They also will not take a straight-line shortcut. Instead, they will draw on what they have learned about their environment to determine a path home using the city streets. How are tourists able to find their way back, based on experience alone, yet unable to determine a straight-line shortcut? This project addresses the challenging problem in the study of human navigation: What is the underlying geometric structure of our navigational knowledge? Is it truly a cognitive map, as is commonly assumed? Is it something coarser and more fluid? We propose that the underlying structure is a graph?a series of connections between places in a network, much like city streets. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test hypotheses about graph knowledge and its properties using walking virtual reality (VR) methods. Outcomes of this research have the potential to impact other fields, including robotics, neuroscience, mathematics, and geography. The interdisciplinary research proposed here will establish a deep understanding of the theory and cognitive mechanisms of spatial orientation, with far-reaching impacts. Greater knowledge of the basic properties of human navigational systems will lead to improved and more effective electronic navigation and GPS systems, self-driving vehicles, emergency response training, and transportation signage. Dr. Chrastil is committed to training the next generation of scientists and increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. As part of this proposal, Dr. Chrastil will develop a workshop on research methods for virtual reality to train researchers on this exciting technique. She actively participates as a teacher and mentor for programs that encourage participation of women and girls in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project specifically tests the hypothesis that the most likely structure of navigational knowledge is a labeled graph, which incorporates local metric information but is not globally consistent across the environment. We have previously conducted an initial test of the idea of a cognitive graph, demonstrating that graph spatial knowledge is used preferentially rather than simply learning routes between locations (Chrastil &amp; Warren, 2014). However, a systematic test of labeled graph knowledge has not been conducted. Little is known about how graph knowledge is constructed during learning or whether labeled graphs are used across all individuals and situations. Here, we propose a framework detailing the theoretical contributors to graph knowledge. We will also test the relationship between graph knowledge and other spatial knowledge taxonomies. In a series of experiments, we will use fully-immersive virtual reality to test hypotheses regarding the nature of spatial knowledge. First, we will characterize the nature of cognitive graphs by pitting labeled graph knowledge against other types of spatial knowledge and testing a primary prediction of labeled graph knowledge. Next, we will test the constraints on labeled graph knowledge, such as generalizability across contexts, its relationship to other taxonomies, and spatial preference. Finally, we will examine the mechanisms of learning labeled graph knowledge, in particular the deployment of attention and active decision making. This research cuts across levels of analysis by contrasting local and global levels of spatial understanding and by pitting labeled graphs against other spatial systems. The results of the proposed work will provide critical insight into the fundamental formation of human spatial knowledge and will contribute to the fields of robotics and neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spanish-English bilingualism has become a hallmark of communities across the U.S., from the growing Cuban-American population in Miami, Florida, to the long-established Mexican-American communities throughout the Southwest, to the population of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Across these communities, there is a common linguistic practice that plays a central role in bilingualism research: language mixing. Defined as the simultaneous use of two languages within a single conversation, language mixing is viewed by some as haphazard or indicative of incompetence. However, linguistic research has demonstrated that language mixing is structured and rule-driven, and that accomplishing it requires great skill in both languages. Despite its ubiquity across bilingual communities the world over, however, linguists have yet to agree on what counts as actual instances of language mixing. Likewise, while much is known about the social aspects of language mixing, research has only begun to explore the psychological and cognitive characteristics of language mixing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation research supported by this award combines approaches from different subdisciplines in linguistics to provide a clearer understanding of how bilinguals combine their two languages. The project focuses on the use of single English nouns of English embedded in otherwise Spanish sentences--so-called ""lone items"".  By bringing together the rich source of knowledge on the use of lone items in bilingual speech and modern psychological techniques, the project will examine how lone items are processed and comprehended, and how sensitive bilinguals are to grammatical changes in the use of lone items. Although linguistic understanding of bilingualism has improved greatly over the past several decades, heavy stigma still surrounds the use and mixing of two or more languages. The present research will contribute to the growing body of research showing that language mixing is a skill, and has social, psychological, and cognitive characteristics that influence human language understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Substantial inter-individual variability exists, with some older individuals showing episodic memory performance and neural recruitment equivalent to some young. Existing theories suggest that malleable lifestyle factors, like sleep, contribute to this variability but are not yet well-informed by such evidence. Established age-related declines in habitual sleep quality, the relationship between sleep and neural functioning in memory-supporting brain regions, and the role of sleep in episodic memory consolidation make sleep an essential lifestyle factor to examine. The primary goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the extent to which individual differences in sleep quality contribute to those in neural activity that, in turn, contribute to episodic memory success across the normal adult lifespan. Students from high school through graduate level receive hands on training in all aspects of conducting cognitive neuroscience research pertinent to human memory functioning and the health and lifestyle factors that influence it in diverse, adult lifespan samples. The potential impact of this research for understanding how malleable, individual difference factors affect cognitive decline in aging is high. These results from a large, racially diverse sample will inform existing theories of cognitive changes across the lifespan and future interventions by providing knowledge of the approximate age, specific brain systems, and aspects of memory for which sleep quality is most important and for which sleep interventions may be most effective in the general population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty utilizing cognitive control and the patterns of prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity underlying it is a major contributor to episodic memory decline in normal aging. Sleep quality is related to PFC integrity and its associated network connectivity. Normal aging has been shown to negatively affect this activity, sleep quality, and episodic memory performance but the relationship between these variables is unclear. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the extent to which age-related sleep disruptions contribute to those in PFC network activity during learning that, in turn, affect episodic memory performance. A mediation model is proposed in which poor sleep quality partially mediates the negative impact of healthy aging on episodic memory via reduced resolution of interference during learning, a major age-related cognitive control deficit. A diverse sample of 90 young, middle-aged, and older adult participants without sleep disorders, perform multiple episodic memory tasks that tax different interference resolution functions is measured to assess the generalizability of the negative impact of poor sleep. Episodic memory is assessed behaviorally and supporting brain activity measured with fMRI. In order to evaluate the specificity of the model to episodic memory, both episodic and item memory are tested. Memory is tested immediately following learning and after a 24-hour delay in order to separately assess the impact of sleep on new learning from consolidation. The influence of multiple confounds, including medication, naps, depression, and exercise is controlled through screening and statistical analyses. Objective measures of sleep are obtained using actigraphy, the best method for assessing habitual sleep patterns over multiple days for a large number of individuals naturally, in their homes, with minimal intrusion. Mediation results from average sleep estimates, the night immediately prior to memory testing, and night-to-night variability are compared in order to separate the impact of habitually poor sleep from variable or a poor night's sleep. Univariate analyses are used to identify PFC regions that support resolution of interference defined by activity that is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)-derived interference signals. Functional connectivity analyses are additionally applied to identify the networks affected by sleep quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Homelessness is one of the most significant issues affecting human health, well-being, and ecosystem services in the United States. The problem is particularly evident in Las Vegas where 67 percent of the homeless population is unsheltered. This raises concerns related to the public and environmental health implications of human fecal contamination of local water systems, specifically flood control infrastructure. Similar to many cities throughout the US, Las Vegas also discharges treated wastewater effluent upstream of its drinking water intakes. Therefore, if the wastewater and drinking water infrastructure are not sufficiently resilient, the added stress from flood control infrastructure may create a positive feedback loop leading to greater exposure to contaminants of emerging concern and more frequent outbreaks of waterborne disease. This research targets two long-term outcomes related to these issues: (1) generation of data and models that can be used to increase understanding of the broader public health implications of homelessness and (2) development of tools and products to effectively disseminate this knowledge to contribute to more effective measures to address homelessness and mitigate related impacts on public and environmental health. Although this research focuses on Las Vegas, concerns related to the nexus of homelessness and water quality exist in numerous cities throughout the country, thereby offering ample opportunity for replication in other regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research employs a transdisciplinary systems-level approach to characterize the interdependence and resilience of flood control, wastewater, and drinking water infrastructure in the context of potable reuse. The overall objective of the research is to fully characterize the nexus of water quality and public health implications of unsheltered homeless encampments. This research addresses the following environmental engineering and social science hypotheses. (1) Inadequate sanitation practices within the unsheltered homeless population result in significant deterioration of surface ater quality. These impacts are characterized using advanced chemical methods (gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy) for the detection of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, and other indicator trace organic compounds. The chemical data are complemented by advanced microbiological methods [16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and microbial source tracking] for the detection of fecal indicators, human-specific markers, and pathogens. (2) Flood control and wastewater infrastructure contribute pathogen and disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursor loadings that may lead to adverse public health impacts in drinking water infrastructure systems. Pathogen monitoring data are integrated into a system dynamics model in a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework. The relative contributions of DBP precursors from surface water, wastewater, and flood control infrastructure are based on trihalomethane (THM), haloacetic acid (HAA), and nitrosamine formation potentials using free chlorine, chloramines, and ozone as the target disinfectants. (3) Advanced treatment with ozone-biofiltration can be optimized to improve the resiliency of drinking water infrastructure as a DBP barrier by increasing the removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)which typically is elevated during and after rainstorms in urban areas. This effort is best informed by quantitative stable isotope probing to identify the microbial taxa responsible for NDMA biodegradation. The research team also uses ethnographic methods to characterize the homeless experience and their decision making processes, thereby allowing for the development of targeted outputs that can inform stakeholders and decision makers. Finally, through collaboration with the UNLV Department of Film, the research team also produces a short documentary on the nexus of homelessness and water quality in Southern Nevada. In addition to exposing film students to modern issues in engineering and social science, the documentary serves as the foundation of future outreach and education activities aimed at raising awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecosystem services, the benefits provided by an ecosystem, are one basis for assigning value to healthy ecosystems. Services include the capacity of an ecosystem to provide food and water, to help mitigate environmental impacts, to produce essential nutrients, and to provide cultural opportunities and experiences. Cultural ecosystem services, such as fishing and birdwatching, are hard to price, however, and consequently have received less attention even though they may outweigh other services in terms of perceived importance. To enhance understanding of cultural ecosystem services, the researcher will investigate fishing-related cultural services and the impacts that may result from the introduction of aquaculture to supplement or replace declining fisheries.  The research is important because fisheries throughout the United States are threatened. Communities risk losing the industry that shaped their towns, local identities, and associated jobs unless alternatives are introduced that can match all of the services associated with their declining fishery, including the highly valued cultural services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by University of Maryland anthropology doctoral student Adriane Michaelis, who is supervised by Dr. Laura J. Shaffer. The researcher has chosen to focus on oyster aquaculture, which, although known to provide many of the services associated with wild oyster fisheries, has not been studied from the perspective of its associated cultural services. The research has a comparative design. Data collection will take place in three culturally distinctive regions -- the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and coastal New England --where aquaculture of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) now occurs. The research is framed with three overarching questions: 1) What are the cultural services obtained through oyster aquaculture and how do they rank amongst related ecosystem services? 2) How do these cultural services vary regionally and according to different participant attributes? 3) Can oyster aquaculture provide the same types of cultural services as public fisheries? The researcher will gather data through a mix of ethnographic methods including through semi-structured interviews with oyster farmers, commercial fishermen, and community members; participant observation; photovoice; and a Q-sort survey using a standard platform. By looking at the effects of shifting from public to private fisheries, findings from the research will contribute to improved social scientific understanding of socio-ecological systems as dynamic systems. Findings will also help resource managers expand their understanding of the costs and benefits of different management choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to identify connections across researchers in broadening participation.  Computational analysis of research papers, and their citations, will map and illuminate the structure of this network.  Guided by this map, the project team will interview and study a range of researchers, with focus on how these researchers generate and store data.  Through this project, the researchers will learn how to better share data; compare and strengthen research findings; and build community toward more effective national-scale research on broadening participation.  This in turn will aid larger scale interventions, making more meaningful strides toward diversity and inclusion across science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will begin with computerized analysis of federal grant awards and publications arising from those awards.  The project team has expertise managing and analyzing large complex data sets, synthesizing patterns, identifying gaps in knowledge, quantifying trends, and creating visualization tools.  This analysis will reveal the structure of diversity and inclusion research communities.  From these communities, key scientists will be recruited for further study.  This will include in-depth interviews and a focus group gathering.  This study will reveal problems and solutions to build data collaborations; ways researchers execute their data management plans; how they utilize datasets as scarce resources, beyond the contexts of hypothesis generating and testing; and how shared data and data-management practices can foster a stronger, empirically grounded research community in broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Steve,,Charman,charmans@fiu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,03/01/2019,02/29/2024,195190.00,"One of the primary recommendations regarding eyewitness evidence is to video record witnesses' lineup identifications. The underlying rationale for this recommendation is intuitive: a video-record provides information about deviations from best practices and may promote lineup administrator compliance with established guidelines. As much as these benefits resonate with psychological researchers, there is no research on any potential costs to video-recording. For example, it is unknown whether the act of video-recording negatively impacts witnesses' decision-making process. Furthermore, the intuitive benefits described above are likely a small subset of the potential advantages of video-recording identification procedures. The purpose of the proposed studies is, therefore, to test for possible additional benefits to video-recording that might accrue across the spectrum of an eyewitness's interaction with the justice system and to identify potential costs of the recommendation. The results from the proposed research will either provide additional support for this recommendation, thereby encouraging reluctant police departments to adopt the practice, or will highlight concerns regarding its implementation. As responsible advocates of science-based recommendations, psychological scientists must find answers to these questions in order to determine how to implement this recommendation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, an experiment tests whether video-recordings of eyewitness lineup identifications reveal different non-verbal behaviors between accurate and inaccurate witnesses, information which could be used by the legal system to assess witness reliability. In addition, the experiment tests whether witnesses make different identification decisions as a function of being recorded, as predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness decision-making. The second phase tests whether showing witnesses a video of their own identification inoculates witnesses from harmful confidence inflation produced by post-identification feedback, a potentially beneficial effect predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness confidence assessment. One experiment in this phase tests whether this effect is moderated by camera perspective; a second experiment tests whether this effect is moderated by the difficulty of the lineup task. The final phase tests whether showing fact-finders a video of an eyewitness identification procedure assists them in discriminating accurate from inaccurate witnesses. One experiment in this phase tests whether this benefit depends on fact-finders' prior beliefs about the guilt of the identified person. A second experiment tests whether an empirically-validated checklist containing information about witnesses' non-verbal cues to accuracy improves the ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate witnesses. As a whole, the proposed experiments test heretofore unexamined benefits and costs of video-recording eyewitnesses' identifications. From a practical perspective, data from these experiments can be used to develop recommendations regarding how to implement the video-recording recommendation as well as how to use those video-recordings to improve fact-finder decision-making. From a theoretical perspective, data obtained from these experiments might suggest essential refinements to models of witness decision-making and retrospective confidence reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shifts in firm market power, global competition and firm structure are implicated in these changes. To cut costs, some dominant brand manufacturers have been spinning off supplier functions to lower wage firms.  Branded companies may also subcontract out most low skill labor while absorbing the profits associated with the brand.  Other mechanisms include franchisors leasing their brand to revenue constrained franchisees and global commodity chains in which large retailers or manufacturers in high income countries delegate routine production to low wage locales.  This package of dynamic shifts in the power, productivity, boundaries, and global scope of dominant firms appears to have been encouraged in some countries by national employment policy models and the rise of a shareholder performance model. This project will both generate and test organizational level explanations for rising within and between firm earnings inequalities.  Project findings will have implications for national labor market policy development in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes interdisciplinary collaborators and data on four countries sampled because they have different levels of exposure to the global economy and different patterns of contemporary shifts in institutional employment protections. In each of these countries the project will access multiple years of linked employer-employee administrative data collected directly from employers by each nation's government. Sample sizes range from a low of 20,000 workplaces and 1,500,000 employees in one country to comparable data on the entire economies in other countries. Using thirty-year country-specific panels of workplaces, the project will model national and workplace level dynamics in both between and within workplace earnings inequalities as a function of industrial restructuring, changes in the organization of production, as well as the pressures of shifting institutions and global competition. Multivariate error correction panel models will be used to estimate causal effects.

While these assumptions greatly simplify the statistical methods needed, if they are incorrect, conclusions obtained can be misleading. An alternative is to use so called nonparametric methods, which impose weaker assumptions, but consequently, the results obtained are often not precise enough to reach strong conclusions. This research explores the use of shape restrictions to impose additional structure, but without specifying a particular relationship. Shape restrictions, such as monotonicity or convexity, are often reasonable assumptions and they can be implied by basic economic theory. For example, the demand of a product is decreasing in its price.  The project proposes statistical methods to estimate relationships and summarize uncertainty under shape restriction, which keep the flexibility of nonparametric approaches, but can yield much more precise conclusions. These methods are appealing in a wide range of real world applications. In this research, they are applied to analyze demand functions, conduct inference in auctions models, and estimate quantile functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a technical level the project overcomes challenges in the statistical theory resulting from the use of shape restrictions. Specifically, the distribution of the restricted estimator depends on where the shape restrictions bind, which is unknown a priori. This research suggests an inference method based on test inversion, which yields uniformly valid confidence regions for unknown parameter vectors or functions. The method applies to a wide range of finite dimensional and nonparametric problems, to various nonparametric estimators, and to many different shape restrictions. Inference is based on the distribution of a shape restricted estimator, which is an approximate quadratic projection of an unrestricted estimator onto a restricted parameter space and this projection depends on a weight matrix. The investigator studies optimal choices of the weight matrix, which can have large effects on properties of the restricted estimators and the corresponding confidence regions. Next to proving uniform size control, the project also investigates power properties to quantity the gains from using shape restrictions. Finally, this research illustrate these gains and the wide applicability in Monte Carlo simulations and in various empirical applications, studying demand models under monotonicity, auction models with parameter dependent support, and non-crossing conditional quantile functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Laura Pulido at the University of Oregon, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of grassroots movements in urban sustainability transitions. Over the last two decades, the United State's homeless population has grown substantially. At the same time, environmental concerns have become more mainstream. As a result, public agencies are increasingly tasked with managing conflicts that result in and from homeless people living in urban green spaces. In response, grassroots groups are establishing homeless rest areas. Also called tent cities or encampments (and distinct from publicly funded highway rest areas), rest areas now exist in over 100 US cities. Rest areas typically involve a collection of tents and temporary shelters on public and private land. They are usually managed by and for homeless people, providing a safe place for daily life off the streets. Yet, little research has focused on these spaces and communities in the context of the green urbanism movement. This project addresses three questions: 1) What is the current geography of rest areas in US cities?, 2) What is the relationship between rest area communities and conservation organizations and public agencies?, and 3) What role do rest area communities play in grassroots movements for urban sustainability? This research contributes insights for policymakers and community organizations seeking to manage urban green spaces and address the needs of a growing homeless population.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines urban socio-ecological change in an era defined by growing mainstream environmental consciousness, green urban development, and housing precariousness. Integrating relational/comparative urbanism theory into an extended case method framework, this project entails an in-depth investigation of one particular grassroots organization based in Portland, Oregon that is known for its role in promulgating the homeless rest area model throughout the US. The project then extends from this central case to involve a broad survey of US rest areas (n~140) and a deeper investigation of rest areas in four municipalities selected for their status as green cities and their relationships to the central case, as well as for their variations in region, broader social/EJ movement foci, and rest area developmental stages. A national phone survey, in-person interviews, observation, and content analysis of municipal documents and media coverage will result in a new mapping of the role of rest area communities in urban sustainability transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such research paradigms emphasize meaningful, egalitarian relationships with communities whose languages are under threat. This project supports a workshop organized for the annual meeting of SSILA, and it proposes to infuse new methodologies and strategies for documenting and revitalizing American indigenous languages by bringing together academic and community language experts from Central and South America with a North American audience. The goal is to bring together these diverse perspectives and enrich the quality of language data for linguistic research, ultimately leading to new insights about relationships among languages, traditional knowledge embedded within language, and the possibilities of the human mind. Broader impacts include the potential for engagement with and advancing knowledge to the greater audience of linguists who attend this annual meeting, the availability of results through the SSILA website, and the potential benefits of approaches from other regions of the Americas that can positively impact the preservation and revitalization of Native American languages in the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide an initial platform for communication among community members, researchers, and institutions across the Americas who engage in community-based language work.

Because there are few consistent platforms for communication across the Americas, noteworthy work on community-based approaches to language documentation, and revitalization taking place elsewhere in the Americas does not always reach U.S.-based community members and researchers and Native American communities. Research agendas into acquisition of endangered languages, or the broadening of participation by training indigenous language speakers are both areas where the U.S. lags behind. Novel approaches through this knowledge exchange has the potential to enhance scientific understanding and investigation into the linguistic diversity of the Americas, broaden participation by Native Americans and Latinos in the U.S. in the language sciences, while the involvement of students has the potential to enhance the STEM workforce in an increasingly globalized context. The methodology employed will include a collective impact model, defined as a commitment by a diverse set of stakeholders to solve a specific social problem under a centralized infrastructure, to collectively tackle the challenges of unnatural language loss. The model will help establish strategies for future communication, collaborations, and dissemination of community-based approaches to language preservation, maintenance, revitalization, and documentation across the Americas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to simulate an economy in the laboratory within which we can trigger a permanent decline in economic activity along with falling prices, and then to explore various policy interventions that have the potential to repair the stagnant economy. In particular, the project focuses on what actions policy makers can take (monetary and fiscal policy) to restore the experimental economy to full employment.  The research explores whether the timing and contextual communication of policy can influence the efficacy of policy. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The laboratory experiments in this project are designed to explore secular stagnation in a closed economy. Specifically, the research implements a recent formalization of secular stagnation that uses an overlapping-generations structure to break the representative agent assumption and allow for endogenous bouts of activity at the zero lower bound (ZLB).  Exogenous deleveraging shocks can trigger spending gluts that create deflation, and lead to a secular stagnation equilibrium, which can be unique. The objective of the research is to identify whether deflationary and inflationary equilibria emerge when they are unique, and to explore equilibrium selection when multiple equilibria exist. Additionally, the project investigates the ability of monetary policy, in the form of inflation targeting, and fiscal policy, consisting of ""helicopter drops"" financed using lump-sum taxes levied on the middle-aged cohort in our experimental economy, to pull the economy out of a deflationary equilibrium following a debt-deleveraging shock. Both potential remedies improve economic conditions through an expectations channel by making households more optimistic about future economic conditions.

The team starts with the observation that many and possibly most economic decisions require time, attention, and careful reasoning. In other words, economic decisions require a specific kind of work called cognitive effort. However, most standard approaches used in macroeconomics assume that people can make their economic decisions instantaneously, with no effort. The research team will develop and analyze a new and tractable model of an entire economy where people, firms, and institutions find that reasoning requires costly cognitive effort. The model allows for the possibility that individuals, businesses, and policymakers may make economic decisions that are not in their long-run best interest simply because determining the best action takes too much time and effort. This is consistent with results from behavioral science. The new model may give us new tools to predict the effects of economic policies, and therefore could contribute to U.S. economic growth as well as advancing fundamental knowledge in economic science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cognitive limitations studied in this project are not about agents imperfectly observing the relevant state variables such as interest rates, prices, and tax rates. Instead, the focus here is on agents imperfectly computing actions such as hours worked and how much to spend and save. The standard approach in macroeconomics focuses on issues created by imperfect observation and assumes a mapping derived under full rationality. The approach taken in this research is consistent with experimental evidence. Formally, the research starts with the assumption that agents observe the objective states but do not know their optimal policy function. They therefore make rational decisions about how to expend costly cognitive resources to learn about the policy function. The team will first develop a tractable static framework of individual behavior. The key emerging property is that as information accumulates about the unknown policy function, the optimal reasoning choice makes agents' effective actions state and history dependent, leading to non-linearity, endogenous persistence, and volatility clustering. The non-linearity generates both inertia to small shocks, and a salience like effect for large shocks. The second project extends the theoretical analysis to a dynamic setting where agents fully anticipate how current reasoning choices impact future utility and choices. The third project sets the mechanism in a representative agent macro model and studies its aggregate implications, where the non-linear features of the micro behavior are likely to re-surface in aggregate outcomes. There the cognitive limitations that affect individual decision rules as well as the preception of general equilibrium effects are jointly analyzed. The fourth project introduces heterogeneity and incomplete markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The jobseeker is also asked about how her family feels about the job match.   The researchers are interested in whether the job-seeker chooses to apply to the positions for which she is matched with.  The results of this experiment are matched with a series of questions that measure differences between the jobseeker's preferences and her perceptions of her family's preferences regarding her job search to shed light on how family concerns and job place characteristics jointly affect female labor supply decisions.  The results of this research project will provide inputs into policies to increase female labor supply and in the process, enhance economic growth and reduce gender income inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will use field experiments to investigate the effects of gender-related job and firm characteristics and family and social perceptions on female labor supply.  The PIs will provide information about work place and firm characteristics, such as the gender composition of workers, supervisor's gender, and hours of work, to randomly selected individual prospective job-seekers as well as elicit information about familial consent of the job and firm characteristics to see how these affect the jobseeker's labor supply decisions.   In a cross-randomization, individuals are primed to think about their family's job search advice.  The outcome of interest is whether the job-seeker chooses to apply to each of the positions for which she is matched and meets the basic qualifications.  The results of this experiment are matched with a series of willingness-to-pay vignettes that measure differences between her own preferences and her perceptions of her family's preferences regarding her job search, to shed light on household constraints on female labor supply decisions.  The results of this research will shed light on why female labor force participation in many parts of the world has not kept pace with increased female education.  The results will also provide inputs into policies to employ increasing female human capital, hence lead to faster economic growth, increased income, and possibly gender equity in incomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The price at which they can sell these bonds play a critical role in determining their cost of financing deficits, their implementation of monetary policy, and even the extent to which they can successfully navigate macroeconomic shocks. These auctions commonly come in two forms - uniform-price auctions (UP), in which all bidders pay the same price for the bonds and discriminatory-price auctions (DP) in which all bidders pay what they bid. This project will explore the determinants of bond prices and how sensitive those prices are to available information about governments and about macroeconomic variables. The project will further look at how these different auction protocols affect the revenue of governments as well as the likelihood of debt crises and the exposure of bond prices to changing economic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research consists of two projects. The first project develops a tractable theoretical framework to understand investors' bidding behavior and information choices in response to different auction protocols. The project uncovers a theoretically relevant trade-off between these two protocols when information is asymmetric. On the one hand, UP auctions allow governments to obtain an average higher price for its bonds. On the other hand, this protocol increases the sensitivity of bond prices to demand shocks. The second project consists on exploring the testable implications of the model utilizing detailed auction data in a setting where auction protocols have changed intermittently for the same country and sovereign interest rates went through periods of high turbulence and periods of prolonged stability. The project will also digitize this data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ICC provides a scientific venue that covers all aspects of cartographic research, a venue that is ideal for young scholars to present their research and to talk face-to-face with an international community of scientists. Young scholars who have attended previous ICCs have demonstrated productive research programs in cartography and GIScience, as evidenced by their scientific publications and success securing funding to support their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of this support for students and early career scholars is research innovation and collaboration that promotes future leaders in research in cartography and GIScience in the United States. Participation in the International Cartographic Conference will lead to the development of globally relevant cutting-edge research and will enable U.S. scholars to take a lead in these endeavors. These young scholars develop new research agendas that couple key scientific and societal challenges in collaboration with the international community, and actively disseminate technical and methodological advances in cartography through workshops, seminars, and peer-reviewed publications. These young scholars benefit from exposure to ideas from the international cartographic community, but also share the American experience in this high priority research area for cartography and GIScience. These accomplishments in turn result in the development of a creative and productive workforce conducing innovative research in cartography and geographic information science that serve the Nation's interests regarding spatial information infrastructure.

To date, the vast majority of decision-making research uses relatively simple stimuli to systematically relate independent variables within an experiment to collected dependent variables such as response time, EEG, or fMRI measures. However, the decisions that we make in our everyday lives are significantly more complicated. We exist in environments where resource and reward structures change dynamically on a daily, even momentary, basis. In these environments, cognitive control is necessary to successfully adjust our goals and representations to match the dynamics of our environment. Data from the experiments conducted during this project, as well the analytic methods, will be used to create a comprehensive syllabus in the emerging field of model-based cognitive neuroscience.  The materials, data, and code for performing the analyses will also be made available to the broader scientific community, so that other universities may adopt the course sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive control is essential to successfully adjust our goals and representations to match dynamic changes in the environment. It is argued that our understanding of the mechanisms by which control is carried out in the brain is limited by the lack of statistical methodology to (1) rigorously investigate cognitive models equipped with mechanisms of control, (2) relate mechanisms of control to brain data, and (3) justify the inclusion of complicated mechanisms by assessing model fit and complexity. In this proposal, I hope to use hierarchical (Bayesian) joint modeling techniques to address each of these three limitations. The hierarchical component of this research is specifically designed to assess individual variation in the degree to which cognitive control is executed. The joint modeling component of this research is designed to link neurophysiological measures (e.g., EEG, fMRI) to cognitive theories about how control is executed. Finally, to fully examine the degree to which stochastic mechanisms of control may best describe individual subject data, I will build on existing techniques I have developed for approximating these processes through likelihood-free Bayesian methodology. Each of these components will be used collectively to systematically examine the neural basis of control in various cognitive tasks, and specifically the degree to which individuals are capable of successfully executing said control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The increasing availability and sophistication of these technologies and methods profoundly affects how archaeologists and other scholars work. The things archaeologists study - from artifacts to sites to landscapes - almost always have a spatial component and for many decades space has been viewed as one of the central dimensions of archaeological study. The capabilities of geospatial technologies to enhance the discovery and interpretation not only offers new data, but also creates entirely novel means of engaging with the archaeological record. Through the SPARC Program high-impact projects seeking to explore and implement geospatial technologies and methods are selected based on peer reviewed applications. Their work is supported through close collaborations with experts in spatial archaeometry at The University of Arkansas' Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST), the University of Glasgow and Dartmouth University. Together, the teams at these institutions form a center for innovative geospatial research and methods in archaeology. Technical experts and research staff at CAST, Dartmouth and Glasgow actively promote geospatial technologies in archaeology, and collaborate with the selected projects, providing access to equipment, methodological and domain expertise, and intensive training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program's goals are to: enhance the research productivity of archaeological projects by making geospatial technologies available to researchers who would not otherwise have access to the tools or skills needed to collect and analyze these data; directly generate high value archaeological data by participating in fieldwork and analytical projects to efficiently collect and analyze geospatial data; provide training opportunities for students and professionals seeking to use geospatial techniques in their own research; promote the development of new geospatial methods and applications in archaeology and the visibility of these innovations in the broader archaeological community; and support good practice and promote innovation in archiving and publication of digital geospatial data. The new support from the NSF Archaeometry program will allow SPARC to continue building a program that is increasingly visible - attracting top research projects; efficient - as project staff build on their experience; high impact - as pilot projects build skills in research teams around the world; and innovative - with broader collaborations leading to significant methodological advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GVDE resource will make a wide range of geospatial, spatial statistical, and geographic information system software available to allow researchers to share, access, build on, and conduct new research involving confidential data within the enclave.  It will be a secure research environment for sharing confidential geospatial research data, thereby enabling the replication of prior research involving confidential geospatial data.  The GVDE will create new research infrastructure for scientists to share data so that research results are replicable and national investments in data creation are preserved for subsequent analysis.  The project will train researchers in techniques to protect confidentiality in geospatial data.

The privacy challenges of confidential geospatial data are not yet fully understood by many members of the scientific research community.  As a result, research is often impeded by uncertainty regarding geospatial data confidentiality or by a lack of effective methods for safely sharing and accessing confidential geospatial research data for analysis or replication.  To address these problems, the investigators will enhance the GVDE and its core capabilities to share, access, analyze, and replicate geospatial data.  They will evaluate and implement confidentiality protection techniques to enable researchers to anonymize and export maps, analyses, and visualizations derived from analyses conducted in the GVDE.  They will develop and implement a researcher credentialing system to provide trained and trusted researchers with a durable digital identifier to safely access and use the GVDE.

Despite growth in the value of U.S. manufacturing, the number of manufacturing workers in the U.S. has declined, with fewer middle-income jobs and displaced workers experiencing large losses in earnings. Leveraging new empirical data and methods, we anticipate the effects of current and emerging technologies on labor outcomes with a precision that provides meaningful insights for training programs and for workforce policies that can mitigate related labor market failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant literature exists on technological change and its influence on employment, wages, and productivity. This literature suggests that technology change causes a shift away from routine tasks and towards disproportionate wage gains for workers with higher skills. The research to-date, however, has largely been unable to distinguish between different types of technology change, and the possible relation to wages and employment. Further, the economic approach linking policy and technical change has been mostly limited to historical and aggregated (e.g., regional or national) data. These approaches are unable to characterize the consequences of emerging technology changes at individual manufacturing steps and the consequences for labor at very fine levels of required skills, training, and competencies. This coarseness in modelling provides a challenge to the design of effective training policies and limits the ability to understand the impact of emerging technologies on the specific skills required for workers. We propose new methods and present novel empirical data to address these issues and anticipate the labor market effects of emerging technologies. Specifically, we seek to anticipate (i) how emerging technologies affect productivity, wages, and employment; (ii) the implications for state-of-the-art economic production functions, and (iii) labor market failures that may be particularly severe in the presence of disruptive technological change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent studies have been able to predict, to some degree, individual differences in intelligence from the connectivity pattern among brain regions obtained at rest with functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).  However, it remains unclear how reliable these findings are, how well they replicate, and to what extent they generalize to other samples.  These questions have also limited our understand of what it is in the neuroimaging data that drives these predictions; for example, are there specific brain regions, or specific ways that the data are processed that make a difference?  To address these questions this project will begin with a successful initial finding, predicting intelligence from rs-fMRI with a particular approach, in a large data set (the Human Connectome Project data, HCP).  Building from this initial finding, a series of research aims will then investigate how different kinds of analyses might yield different results, how statistically reliable the findings are, how well they replicate, and how they generalize to databases other than the HCP.  These findings will be high methodological value to all scientists working in this field and will also yield initial answers to important questions regarding the neural basis of intelligence. All work will use open-science practices including but not limited to pre-registration and data sharing of data and software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project capitalizes on recent success in predicting general intelligence (g) from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data in the Human Connectome Project dataset (HCP).  Its principal aims are to investigate the reliability, reproducibility, and generalizability of this finding. A first aim will quantify the effect of brain alignment, rs-fMRI denoising, brain parcellation, and model-learning strategy on the prediction of intelligence from rs-fMRI in the HCP.  The aim will quantify how choices at key intersections in this processing decision tree affect final prediction results. This investigation will provide a valuable inventory of possible processing pipelines, and the difference that different parameter choices make; aim to yield a single ""best"" combination of analytical choices; and explore which anatomical brain regions, and networks, can best predict intelligence.  A second aim will add graph-theoretical summary features and externally driven brain states to improve the prediction of intelligence in the HCP.   Do features derived from rs- or task-fMRI yield substantially better predictions? Do models built separately from each paradigm, and for different tasks, point to shared anatomical regions? Combining features from both paradigms, what is the best prediction we can obtain?  To investigate the generalizability of results obtained, the results will be replicated across three independent datasets: the Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS; target 1000 participants, 6-85 year-olds), the NIH Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset (ABCD; target 10,000 participants, 9-10 year-olds), and the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN; 700 participants, 18-88 year-olds).

When funds must be collected toward financing a public project, how frequent and informative should be periodic disclosures about progress toward the goal?

Coercive employment occurs when people find themselves outside the bounds of legal labor protections, forced to work in conditions under either the explicit or perceived threat of criminal justice repercussions should they refuse. These differential power dynamics create space for the exploitation of already marginalized laboring populations, which has lasting implications for socioeconomic inequality and recidivism.

Additionally, this project will investigate how people navigate the looming threat of criminal justice sanctions as tied to employment requirements while on parole.

The investigators will use infant DNA methylation at birth as a sensor of the prenatal environment, to assess how the offspring adapts to various maternal signals relayed during pregnancy. They will address whether infant methylation is more correlated with maternal methylation at 7-15 weeks, reflecting the cumulative life history of the mother before pregnancy as DNA methylation changes over the life course in response to the environment, or at 23-34 weeks, where maternal DNA methylation would be expected to change in response to the pregnancy-specific environment.

Research has traditionally tackled this issue by identifying methods that increase the risk of false confession. However, there has recently been a shift towards using psychological theory to enhance methods, with the goal of helping investigators distinguish between guilty and innocent suspects. One such method is the Strategic Use of Evidence (SUE), which involves strategic timing of evidence disclosure (e.g., early vs. late disclosure) and strategic evidence-related questioning to increase statement-evidence inconsistencies in guilty suspects' statements. While SUE has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the difference between liars and truth-tellers, it has yet to be tested using experimental methods rich in psychological realism that better simulate real-world situations (i.e., participants intentionally commit a transgression and are subsequently questioned). In addition, contemporary variations of SUE have yet to be tested with both innocent and guilty suspects. The present research addresses these gaps, and in doing so will: (1) shed light on which SUE variation results in the greatest amount of elicited information; (2) result in findings that are highly applicable to practitioners, as the present experimental methodology better mirrors real-world situations; and (3) offer research experience to underrepresented minority researchers. Overall, the present research will aid law enforcement in obtaining valuable information pertinent to accurately identifying perpetrators and efficiently solving cases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, the present research will employ a cheating paradigm variation in which a research assistant pretending to be a participant prompts (or does not prompt) actual participants to cheat on a supposed ""government-issued"" test. This enables questioner to accuse both innocent and guilty participants of cheating, and to question them using one of four evidence disclosure methods: Early (presenting evidence before questioning), Late (basic SUE, with evidence presented after all questioning), SUE-C (presenting evidence incrementally, with statement-evidence inconsistencies being pointed out), and SUE-C/E (same as SUE-C, except suspects are required to explain any inconsistencies). Except for the Early condition, all conditions represent variations of the SUE technique. It is predicted that: (1) of all evidence disclosure tactics, SUE-C/E will result in the most diagnostic confessions; (2) all SUE variations will result in more lie indicators (i.e., statement-evidence inconsistencies), as compared to early evidence disclosure; and (3) guilty suspects will ultimately offer more incriminating details when questioned with the SUE variations than with early disclosure. Given that findings fall in line with these predictions, SUE can be advocated to law enforcement investigators as a method to help them enhance their investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research provides comparisons of tariffs and non-tariff barriers against pollution emissions.

Providing answers to these questions will enable: (1) the development of a theory about how scientific ethics intersects with Indigenous cultures; (2) the creation of a set of best practices for universities and faculty members related to ethical challenges for Indigenous students and faculty in STEM fields; and (3) identification of a set of future research questions and policy issues related to STEM participation by Indigenous individuals and communities. The results from this research project will enable more equitable representation of Indigenous peoples in STEM, and will enhance understanding of how local cultures interact with ethical issues to shape participation the scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-method research project will use surveys and interviews to understand how Indigenous cultures and taboos shape Indigenous college students' participation in STEM fields. It will blend grounded theory with a Critical Indigenous Research Methodology to conceptualize these issues. Methodologically, the research design will be based on a broad social survey of the experiences and attitudes of Indigenous students in the western United States with STEM professions, followed by in-depth interviews with a strategic subset of survey respondents. These two data streams will then be combined and analyzed in an iterative and comparative fashion. This project will provide important intellectual advancement on three fronts: (1) it will provide theoretical and data-driven insights into how Indigenous cultures interact with scientific cultures in ways that can hinder participation in science, engineering, and mathematics; (2) it will provide practical insights and implementable knowledge for developing new policies to improve participation in STEM fields by one of the most underrepresented social groups in science; (3) it will create new tools and methods that will be useful for future researchers working to understand similar issues. Overall, this project directly advances NSF's goal of broadening participation in STEM fields by underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using several different datasets measuring diversity around the world, researchers have found that it often has a negative impact on democracy, development and political stability. However, these findings rely on fundamentally flawed datasets: their demographic estimates come from questionable sources and do not vary within countries or over time. This makes them ill-suited to studying outcomes like war and development, which often change rapidly and cluster in space. In addition, the existing datasets cannot be directly compared, making it difficult to assess their accuracy. Rather than investing time and money in the collection of new data, this project builds on an existing resource: 9 million survey responses from 175 countries around the world. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to compare these surveys to official statistics and generate improved diversity estimates, other researchers will be able to apply this method in other areas like health and inequality where government statistics are missing or questionable. Further, this project will make our results directly comparable to existing datasets. These data and methods will be made available through a user-friendly online portal, where scientists, policy-makers, and members of the public will be able to explore the data. They will also be able to create their own datasets and use visualization tools to see how the world's demographics are changing and consider what this means for our future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing estimates of ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity are correlated cross-sectionally with a number of socio-political and economic outcomes including development, conflict, and social capital. Close examination of these data raises validity concerns: few are based on high-quality official statistics, the majority coming from questionable secondary sources. Further, criteria for group inclusion (i.e., ontologies) are opaque and inconsistently applied. Even where they appear accurate, data are static and aggregated at the country level, although they are often used to explain time-varying and spatially disaggregated outcomes. Ontologies in extant datasets are also incompatible, making comparison and integration difficult. This proposal improves existing measures by applying machine learning methods to compare 9 million responses across 175 countries with a new database of census results. An algorithm will identify survey design features that maximize accuracy, to define a compensatory weighting scheme across these features. The result is a set of survey-based demographic estimates with improved validity, even for countries lacking reliable census data. This method of triangulating surveys and official statistics is generalizable to research areas that use either source and can also inform improved survey design. The project will also develop tools for linking surveys, censuses, and existing datasets based on explicit and transparent decision rules to facilitate their comparison and integration. An online portal will provide access to datasets and code, supporting customized data manipulation and visualization. The methods and tools proposed here -- emphasizing accuracy, transparency, and cross-resource integration -- should serve as a model for future data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

International development groups refer to these as ""child marriages"" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why ""child marriage"" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood. The project includes the mentorship of an American Postdoctoral Scholar, research experience opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and capacity building for longer-term international collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geoffrey M. Boynton in the Psychology Department and Patricia K. Kuhl, co-director of the Institute for Learning &amp; Brain Sciences, will purchase a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner for human neuroimaging research. MRI is the primary tool for investigating the human brain.  This instrument will be shared and available for scientists from a wide range of departments including Psychology, Speech and Hearing, Radiology, Psychiatry and Computer Science. This state-of-the-art device has four functions for studying the human brain: structural imaging, functional imaging, diffusion weighted imaging and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy.   Structural imaging is using the MRI scanner to acquire images of brain structure which can be used to study, for example, how the brain structure differs across different populations, or how age and experience affect the growth of the human brain.  Functional imaging, or ""functional magnetic resonance imaging, (fMRI)"" is used to measure where and when brain activity occurs as human subjects perform a task or experience sensory stimulation.  fMRI relies on the MRI scanner's ability to measure changes in the level of oxygenated vs. deoxygenated blood that are caused by changes in brain activity.   Diffusion weighted imaging can detect the major neuronal pathways in the brain by measuring the way in which water molecules naturally diffuse along these pathways.  Finally, MR spectroscopy measures the levels of neurotransmitter concentration, such as the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA throughout the brain.  Different levels of GABA have been found to vary, for example, between subjects with autism and neurotypical subjects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new MRI scanner will be the primary device for studying a wide range of human neuroscience problems.  These include studies of linguistic function and dysfunction, cognition, developmental cognitive neuroscience, sensory neuroscience, neurological disorders, and studies of social cognition including autism.  The four functions described above will be used to study a wide variety of subjects including children, adolescents, subjects with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), Alzheimer's, blindness, dyslexia, and Parkinson's disease.  For example, fMRI will be used to study the brain's response while subjects with ADD attempt to ignore a visual stimulus.  In another example, diffusion MRI will be used to study changes in prefrontal executive function networks in children during language development. The new scanner will form the centerpiece of a thriving and growing human interdisciplinary neuroscience community and will further strengthen an existing culture of training in neuroimaging data acquisition and analysis methods. Through a program of courses and hands-on training, we will provide the training that is needed for students and postdocs across all disciplines to master the advanced imaging techniques necessary to launch successful independent careers in the human neurosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even with increasing evidence that there are optimal brain states (e.g. patterns of synchronous neural activity) for learning and memory, little is known about how these optimal states may shift across the lifespan or what may be done to achieve an optimal state during task learning and performance. The proposed research tests the general hypothesis that training older adults to use neural circuitry that is relatively preserved in aging may enable them to continue use of that circuitry when asked to learn or to retrieve information. The potential impact of this research for the later-life learning is high. It could lead to new strategies to teach older adults how to maximize their chance of memory success, especially in scenarios when a learning task is imminent, such as when in an appointment with a physician. Using social media and in-person events, this project will provide outreach activities to inform older adults about scientific findings pertinent to their understanding of brain and cognitive aging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) engagement corresponds with memory success. Older adults recruit IPFC differently than younger adults, and age seems to alter connections between IPFC and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions critical for successful memory.  Older adults remain able to recruit medial prefrontal lobe regions (mPFC) into memory networks and show relative preservation of the control processes implemented by mPFC.  Even though later-life learners can recruit mPFC regions in the service of memory, they often do not; instead, they rely on additional recruitment of lPFC to compensate. The overarching goal of this project is to test whether older adults will perform optimally on learning and memory tasks when they can recruit mPFC into memory networks, and whether they are more likely to do so when that recruitment is facilitated or primed by tasks that encourage mPFC engagement in moments that precede encoding (Aim 1) or retrieval (Aim 2). The selected tasks (e.g. listening to music, reflecting on the self, or retrieving memories) have separately been shown to enhance older adults' memory performance and to increase mPFC engagement.  Participants will engage in these tasks prior to undertaking a memory task, with brain activity measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is hypothesized that older adults' behavioral memory enhancements are mediated by mPFC recruitment, and engaging in these tasks prior to learning or retrieval will increase memory performance.  This project brings together researchers with complementary expertise in the cognitive neuroscience of aging and memory, socioemotional memory, use of fMRI and quantitative methods, and specific experience with the task manipulations to be used in this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, at a time when worker organizations generally are on the decline, this sector has seen an increase. However, preliminary research suggests these new organizations are unlike those of the past. They appear to be focused on broad array of social programs for their membership while simultaneously loosening, or even severing, their ties to formal political parties. The research supported by this award will undertake an ethnographic and archival analysis of this new phenomenon. Findings from this research are important for rethinking the relationship between worker wellbeing and formal worker organizations. Findings will contribute to new theoretical understandings of the contemporary global economy and provide information useful for policy makers and other stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will take place on the coast of Mexico, a tourism dependent region that has witnessed tremendous growth in worker organizations over the past two decades.

For instance, frequent words tend to have fewer sounds than infrequent ones, which facilitates quick production and understanding. However, little is known about more fine-grained distinctions. For instance, English has more /k/ than /p/ sounds. Does that reflect a property of human language and its physiological and perceptual nature or a historical accident? Answering such questions requires comparative data on the frequency and phonological makeup of words in many languages. This project will build on existing textual sources and word frequency lists to provide the phonological makeup of words in close to 200 low-resource languages. The phonological word lists will provide an invaluable resource to the understanding of human language and provide much-needed linguistic resources to low-resource languages. The outputs of the project will be made public and easily accessible, thereby assisting in documenting and teaching the processed languages, and in building computational linguistic resources such as text-to-speech engines.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research team, including trained undergraduate and graduate students, will create rules to translate alphabets to phonemic representation for multiple languages. The team will then collect textual resources and word frequency lists from publicly available sources such as online Bibles, newspapers, and movie subtitles. The rules will be applied separately to each source and the resulting phonological representations will be made publicly available, such that not only researchers but also the general public will be able to use and interact with the data. The researchers will proceed to use the data to investigate whether the information theoretic properties of sounds have distributional universality: do sounds tend to provide similar amounts of information cross-linguistically, and if so, does their information content correlate with their phonetic properties? Universality is an age-old question, and the similarities and differences of properties across language can provide new insights into language use. Specifically, the researchers will use information theoretic properties to predict whether low information or other previously studied phonological properties are likely to promote consonant weakening in those languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cranial shape in perinatal and older subadults is described using volumetric, angular, and landmark-based morphometric data.  A combination of descriptive and inferential statistics are applied to address four specific aims: 1) describe the structure of the perinatal cranial base in a comparative sample of primates; 2) document evidence of cellular and tissue-level mechanisms contributing to growth; 3) test for a phylogenetic effect in perinatal cranial base structure; and 4) test the association of cranial base growth patterns with cranial base angle and facial orientation in the perinatal period and in the adult.

Specific aims of the study are to investigate whether ERI mitigates or worsens the association between racial discrimination and development as well as identify mechanisms by which ERI influences development during the transition to adulthood. This project will improve understanding of how ERI operates and the role social context plays in the associations between racial discrimination and development. The project will also address theoretical debates about the presumed positive impact of ERI.  Developmental outcomes during the transition to adulthood will be assessed using questionnaires and physiological stress reactivity tests. Broader impacts are significant, because findings can be used to improve the social and psychological well-being of vulnerable youth. Moreover, findings can potentially support and further evidence-based prevention-intervention efforts aimed at fostering positive youth development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racial discrimination constitutes a significant risk to the healthy development of African American youth during the transition to adulthood. Some evidence suggests that ERI protects against the harmful effects of racial discrimination, but there have been few systematic attempts to disentangle mixed findings. Participants will be African American young adults attending a southeastern, predominantly White institution and a mid-Atlantic historically Black college/university. Students will complete a series of questionnaires assessing key study variables followed by two laboratory challenges, once a year, for three consecutive years. Autonomic reactivity (as indexed by cardiovascular psychophysiology) will be assessed during the laboratory challenges. The central questions of the study are whether the protective or vulnerability function of ERI is influenced by the social context in which the youth are embedded and whether the impact of ERI on biopsychosocial development can be explained by coping skills, self-esteem, and perceptions of racial discrimination. Key hypotheses are: 1) ERI will act as a vulnerability factor in the link between racial discrimination and development in contexts with lower levels of diversity; 2) Initial levels of racial discrimination will lead to changes in ERI, which, in turn, will be associated with changes in development; and 3) Racism appraisals and coping will explain the association between ERI and changes in development during the transition to adulthood. Hypotheses will be tested using latent growth curve modeling.

Federal and state mandates increasingly encourage medical providers to initiate punitive state responses when they suspect perinatal substance use by pregnant women.

This study uses a variety of qualitative methods to investigate the actions of the different actors in this process, state actors, medical professionals, and pregnant women.  Findings of this research have the potential to influence government policy-making concerning substance-using pregnant women as well as the responses of medical experts and maternal health advocates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study employs a multi-level analysis to assess macro, micro, and intermediate level factors that mutually shape interventions on pregnant women.

At an intermediate level, a year-long ethnographic study of a Labor and Delivery unit uncovers how day-to-day medical practices are carried out and to what extent the state is invited into or intervenes upon these processes. At the micro level, semi-structured interviews with medical professionals and women directly affected by medically-initiated state sanctions show how medical-state collaborations affect care outcomes and patient well-being.

A myriad of reasons for low female participation in engineering have been investigated, such as pay and promotion opportunities and family-related constraints. Attention has also been given to the role of workplace discrimination, as women in STEM experience discrimination at higher rates than women in non-STEM disciplines. However, few researchers have focused their attention on how the day-to-day experiences of women in engineering might facilitate or impede discriminatory behavior. While many of the existing studies on workplace discrimination have focused on the individual or the organization, we argue that teams play an overlooked role in women's experiences in engineering. Taking a team-centric approach, we examine interpersonal discrimination and its multi-level ripple impact on both individual and team outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is designed to complete three high-level objectives. Our first objective is to identify whether and how engineering team experiences differ by gender, specifically in relation to team discrimination.

These manufacturing shifts raise questions that are important for policy, economic competitiveness, and research. Specifically, what are the reasons for firms to alter or refocus their geographic strategies and physical locations, and whether doing so changes the nature and direction of innovation that such firms undertake. This project examines these questions through the case of the global wind technology industry, where both the demand for and manufacturing of wind turbines have shifted from the United States and Europe to emerging economies, including China. The shifts in the location of manufacturing from countries at the frontier of technology to newer markets can potentially shape R&amp;D strategies, technological innovation, and competitive advantage in the wind sector. Given policy targets for wind deployment in emerging and developing countries, additional expansion of the manufacturing of different wind turbine components to new countries is expected, which means it is important to understand the possible tradeoffs associated with the manufacturing shifts. This research informs the design of policies that spur local manufacturing, economic competitiveness, and technology development in globally-distributed, modern manufacturing industries. It also highlights the ways in which manufacturing shifts affect the ability of technological innovation to meet climate and environmental challenges in the long term, thus supporting design of national and international policies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes the types of manufacturing that have shifted geographically and, most crucially, whether and how these international shifts in manufacturing impact the direction of innovation in the wind industry. The research focuses on component manufacturers who are often small and medium enterprises (or SMEs) that supply to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), i.e., the 10-15 manufacturers that assemble wind turbines worldwide. SMEs are particularly relevant for a country's economy as they comprise, for example in the United States, over ninety percent of employer firms. Manufacturing SMEs must innovate to produce goods at increasingly lower costs and/or to develop new capabilities to stay competitive. The project relies on novel data of the wind supply chain at the firm level and a comprehensive mixed-methods approach, including the analysis of global data on OEM-supplier relationships, public policies, component technologies, semi-structured interviews, and patents. In understanding innovation in the global value chain for wind energy that includes both SMEs and larger OEMs, the results of the project contribute to the understanding of what drives decisions by different types of firms to manufacture in their home country or internationally, and whether the location of manufacturing influences the technological focus of innovation and the time-horizon of R&amp;D activities undertaken in a particular industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Economists and policy makers know a lot about the effects of the adoption of Medicaid and Medicare on the beneficiaries of these programs but know very little about whether these effects are transmitted to the recipients' off-springs and how this transmission takes place.  Understanding if and how the benefits of investment in health is passed on to future generations is important for discussions of health policy, such as expansion of Medicare and Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The results of this research may suggest that the benefits of current period investment in health should be expanded to include benefits that may accrue to future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will merge several administrative data sets with Medicaid coverage and Vital Statistics data to investigate the intergenerational effects of childhood Medicaid coverage on the health of children in the next generation. Two issues are investigated in this research project: (i) how does Medicaid affect the size and composition of the next generation and (ii) how does Medicaid affect infant health in the next generation. The project also investigates the mechanisms through which these effects might occur.  The empirical approach uses a quasi-experimental design that relies on wide historical variation in state- and cohort-level exposure to health insurance due to the original introduction of Medicaid in the 1960s. The results of this research project will substantially add to our knowledge of the inter-generational effects of Medicaid and health investment generally and contribute to health policy in the US and around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks how the voice of a Deaf person is represented when that voice must be mediated by an interpreter. Using interpreters requires answering a host of ethical questions; how should interpreters (re)present Deaf people's voices, both metaphorically and literally? How involved should interpreters be in Deaf politics? Who advocates for the growth of interpreting? This study empirically examines how Deaf people and interpreters navigate such ethical questions, and how doing so shapes the development of sign language interpreting, and the way Deaf people and interpreters are perceived by the hearing public. As Deaf organizing and interpreting are emerging simultaneously as fields in which actors engage and position themselves in relation to each other, the question of how interpreters use their physical voices to speak for Deaf people and for themselves has become a source of tension, and the subject of ethical practice. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, this project would broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in science, build capacity and scientific infrastructure through international scientific cooperation, and enhance public scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations outside academe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharon Seegers, under the supervision of Dr. Michele Friedner of the University of Chicago will investigate the formation of ethical practice in interactions among hearing people, sign language interpreters, and signers. This study focuses on sign language interpreting Ha Noi, Viet Nam, where over the past three decades, there has been a rise in Deaf community organization, coupled with a growth in sign language interpreting. The context thus provides a unifor examining how ethical decisions are made in real time, and sign language interpreting protocols are formulated. Drawing from the framework of everyday ethics and the anthropology of the voice, this project examines how Deaf people and interpreters in Vi&amp;#7879;t Nam debate, imagine, create, and inhabit new ethical norms around the complex process of voicing. In particular, the project examines interpreted interactions as a site where Deaf people and interpreters emerge as particular types of subjects. The student researcher will conduct eight months of field work with Deaf people and interpreters in Hanoi, Vietnam, combining ethnographic fieldwork, with semi-structured interviews and conversational analysis of interpreted interactions. She will observe Deaf people and interpreters, to see how they communicate in their daily lives, and how Deaf people are portrayed to hearing people with and without interpreters present. The researcher will also follow Deaf advocacy organizations, to see how Deaf people's voices are portrayed through interpreters, and how the ethics of interpreters' involvement in Deaf organizations is negotiated. This project will advance theoretical debates in anthropology, linguistic, deaf studies, and disability studies about ethics, translation, and disability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to advance the use of smart and connected technologies to empower new modes of community-based decision making to identify and implement transformative solutions to community challenges. The project focuses on resource-constrained communities. The team will offer the community of Benton Harbor, Michigan, tools needed to explore new mobility solutions that provide greater access to employment, education, and healthcare. The project deploys sensing technologies to collect data needed to create analytical models of resident mobility preferences and mobility service performance. A community-based decision making framework will be created using scenario planning methods; in this framework, stakeholders are provided tools to explore mobility solutions with predicted outcomes visualized. Included in the team is the Twin Cities Area Transportation Authority (TCATA), which will iteratively implement mobility solutions originating from the scenario planning process with solutions quantitatively assessed. A partnership with Lake Michigan College further enhances the project's broader impacts by engaging community college students in the research and offering them experiences in the smart city field of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explore the fundamental question of how resourced-constrained communities can utilize smart and connected technologies to implement novel but lean solutions to mobility challenges, the project will define a cost-effective data collection strategy that can assess the performance of existing solutions, track the mobility patterns of residents, and acquire resident perceptions of their mobility. GPS tracking using cell phones apps and computer vision on city buses will be used to generate the data needed to model the performance of current mobility configurations. Surveys of residents will augment these data sources. The project will map mobility data to an analytical framework that can predict both resident demand for mobility services and the performance of these services given changes in user demand. Activity-based models will be created with special emphasis on fine-grain estimation of travel demand in small communities. Predictive models will be developed to predict the quality of transit services provided by configurations of the mobility network. A key advancement will be the creation of scalable computational methods that optimize the mix of fixed route service with on-demand shuttling. This project will enable community-based decision making by visualizing mobility data and predictive outputs during a participatory planning process.

What factors guide the many decisions that translate mental health care into algorithms, a set of instructions carried out by AI? There is tremendous variation in how these companies make mental health into an object that is measurable and/or treatable via algorithm. Facial expressions, vocal tone, word choice, or smartphone usage patterns become potential sources of data that communicate mental health states. In other words, companies do not simply collect data; they determine what counts as data sources and establish the correlation of this data to mental health states, and they are doing so in very different ways. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, the project would broadly disseminate its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of improving mental health diagnosis and treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valerie Black, under the supervision of Dr. Karen Nakamura at the University of California at Berkeley, will explore how technology companies design AI for mental health diagnosis and treatment. The algorithms developed by companies that gather and analyze mental health data are typically proprietary. Since these algorithms are being developed at a time when AI can determine matters ranging from bank loan eligibility to criminal sentencing, there is a growing call for AI decision-making transparency. This project asks how mental health technology companies in the US and Japan (two major, interconnected centers of AI development) are addressing this concern, and how that impacts the ways in which they use AI to provide care. Research will take place at three AI companies (two in the U.S. and one in Japan) in the understudied startup technology sector. Data collection includes interviews and participant observation with innovators and investors, psychological service leads, and engineers and developers. Data will be analyzed to ascertain what objectives, ethical and practical considerations, and relationships inform the mental health care algorithms. This ethnographic investigation aims to further scientific understanding of how different configurations of and approaches to AI make possible an array of different (and sometimes clashing) objectives, strategies, and core beliefs about what constitutes optimal ways of caring for mental health.

The FW-HTF cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. This award fulfills part of that aim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a closed-loop embodied Intelligent Cognitive Assistant (e-ICA) to infer circadian rhythm, alertness, and stress levels and to provide personalized feedback to enhance users' cognitive ability and wellbeing in an unobtrusive and effortless manner. Approximately 20% of the labor force engages in shift work, which often leads to inadequate and poor sleep. Being out of synch with one's natural body clock, or circadian rhythm, can lead to many complications over time, including a higher likelihood for cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, and mental health problems. In addition, there can be serious deficits in cognitive performance, with productivity loss and more accidents in the workplace. This research program will design and develop a novel sensor-based e-ICA that can monitor shift workers' circadian rhythms, sleep patterns, and stress levels. The platform will be flexible so that it can be used to study broad populations in addition to shift workers. Given that 70 percent of the population suffers from circadian rhythm disruption, this technology has the potential to impact a wide range of workers and firms. In addition, the anonymized data and information about developed hardware and software will be shared in the community. The technology will impact the needs of a broad cross-section of stakeholders, but will be tested initially with medical residents and other health practitioners who typically work long shift that change every few weeks.

This project will contribute a set of statistical models and inference methods to stimulate more longitudinal studies and applications in latent trait analysis. The research will be integrated within K-12 education through the application of the developed methods to a personalized learning platform. This platform is widely used by students from Grade 2 to 12 throughout the United States. The investigator also will apply the new methods to data sets from other disciplines, including psychology, ecology, and engineering.  Graduate students will be actively engaged in this research project. Results from this research will be incorporated into an undergraduate seminar, an open online course, and professional development and training courses.

Time is of such importance that all attested human languages have at least one grammatical strategy to encode temporal relationships. Most languages, however, have relatively complex systems of encoding time (which are generally referred to as tense/aspect systems) that interact with several features of the grammar. Individual tense/aspect systems, in addition to their internal complexity, also vary significantly from language to language. Because of the cross-linguistic variation that has been observed, any given language has the potential to offer new insights into the extent of possible temporal encoding strategies, as well as the extent of possible meanings that tense and aspect can carry. The language of study for this project, Iyasa (yko), is a Bantu language spoken in the Littoral Region of southwestern Cameroon by approximately 2,000 people. Tense/aspect studies in Bantu are especially critical as the systems in these languages are noted as being among the most complex in the world. This project will, thus, provide a thorough documentary and descriptive record of Iyasa's system of tense and aspect, utilizing methods in both linguistic fieldwork and linguistic analysis in order to uncover the nuances of the system. Broader impacts include the professional development of a doctoral student, the publicly accessible data, and the presence of an American linguist in Cameroon to help maintain and improve the academic relationship between the two nations. Additionally, the research project and its products can bring linguistic awareness and attention to a language, region, and community of speakers currently under-represented in scientific literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Records of tense/aspect systems of endangered language vary greatly in quality from mere labels of each tense and aspect (leaving it to the reader to assume what precise meanings should be associated with each label) to descriptions where nearly every detail related to tense and aspect is included. In order to achieve an adequately detailed description of the Iyasa tense/aspect system, researchers will make use of a wide variety of methodologies. These methodologies include (but are not limited to) administering tense/aspect questionnaires both already developed and newly developed by researchers on this project, analyzing of tense/aspect in natural narrative and conversational discourse, directed semantic elicitation (where a series of contexts that differ only slightly in meaningful ways are provided by the researcher), and directed narratives that are elicited by means of video clips or storyboards. Another important aspect of this project is that it will incorporate insights from a wide range of theories including cognitive theories of tense and aspect that move away from the notion of time as a single linear timeline. This project, in addition to providing important documentary materials and linguistic training opportunities to the Iyasa community, will provide important insights on how to improve computational models of tense and aspect for natural language processing and help strengthen our general understanding of how humans can and do encode time in language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In both humans and animals, ""motor exploration"" - the process by which the brain generates variations in behavior in order to learn - is critical for both the initial learning of a skill and for the recovery of motor function following neurological injuries. In prior research, motor exploration has been assumed to be a random process. In the proposed research, we will evaluate the hypothesis that motor exploration is not a random process, but rather a systematic exploration, of many patterns of brain activity that might be used to achieve the desired output. Understanding how motor exploration is implemented biologically would not only answer a key basic question in neuroscience but would also open doors for creation of new approaches to rehabilitative therapies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We will achieve these goals by collecting data from the vocal control system in songbirds and by creating novel mathematical tools that can be applied to data from any species.

To motivate civic engagement with health and environmental issues, communicators would benefit from exploring messaging strategies that go beyond informational portrayals of an issue to engage audiences on an emotional level. To this end, this research explores the viability of persuasive anger appeals. According to persuasion theory, anger-arousing messages must not only evoke anger in order to change attitudes and behaviors; they must also instill beliefs about the efficacy of taking action. The theory, however,  has been imprecise about what those efficacy beliefs entail. Because anger tends to motivate a desire to retaliate against a perceived wrongdoer, it follows that anger may have the strongest effects on persuasive outcomes when the audience believes that a particular action will punish the wrongdoer, a new concept the researchers call retributive efficacy. As such, we expect an anger appeal to be most effective when it evokes anger toward culprits of these harms and then communicates how a recommended response will effectively punish the offender. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In examining persuasive anger appeals, the researchers use two issues for which there is scientific consensus about the magnitude of the problem and the need for collective solutions. Three studies examine how to design messages that harness anger about perceived  injustices (referred to as moral anger) and how to translate that emotion into activism. Study 1 uses a cross-sectional survey design to validate a proposed measure of retributive efficacy. Studies 2 and 3 build on the first study by experimentally testing messages that instill moral anger and retributive efficacy. Additionally, study 3 explores the extent to which evoked anger temporally evolves during exposure to such messages -- a phenomenon called emotional flow. Study findings offer risk communicators direct, theory-informed guidance on how to craft maximally effective persuasive appeals to anger. The research also contribute to our theoretical understanding of anger appeals, which have received far less scholarly attention than appeals to other emotions like fear or humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many real-world decisions, which of the available alternatives is chosen is influenced by many different attributes. Such multi-attribute decisions are complex because they require the integration and comparison of many pieces of information. For instance, selecting the bundle of goods that maximizes value given a budget constraint in a supermarket that only stocks 100 different goods requires checking approximately 10^30 possible combinations. For this reason, humans do not use rational choice theory in all their decisions. In addition to having to combine the influence of all the different attributes, another complexity is that one alternative is often preferable on one set of attributes, but another is preferred on others. Making a choice then requires a trade-off, which further complicates the decision process. However, the cognitive and neural processes that are at the heart of preference formation are still poorly understood.  This complexity is thought to tax limited cognitive resources in humans who therefore can pay attention only to a limited set of information, on which the decision is then based. In addition, task history often systematically changes decision biases. This research program takes advantage of the opportunity to obtain direct recordings from individual's brains while they perform such complex decision. It will study these activity patterns to determine whether they can be explained via mathematical models of decision making. Understanding which attributes are considered during decision making, and how they are weighted could explain decision making in typical and a-typical populations. Furthermore this integrative research program forms an opportunity to expose engineering students to dynamical systems and control theories in an interdisciplinary context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines behavioral data, neural recordings in humans (patients undergoing epilepsy evaluation) implanted with multiple depth electrodes covering many cortical and subcortical brain areas, and computational approaches to develop a new theory of the neural mechanisms underlying multi-attribute decision-making in complex environments. This is a unique opportunity to study brain circuits simultaneously across multiple brain areas while humans make these decisions.  The overall goal of the present proposal is to understand the neural circuit involved in (1) representing the relevant decision variables, (2) integrating these variables to form subjective values, and (3) selecting one of the options in multi-attribute decisions. Participants, with implanted electrodes, will work in a novel behavioral task that makes it possible to observe their focus of attention while they evaluate the offers and select one of them.  Data will constrain cutting edge computational models of multi-attribute decision making that will combine: (i) a procedural model of the decision in each trial, and (ii) a latent variable model of biasing influence on decision-making resulting from past trial history. The computational models will make it possible to identify neuronal activity that represents task-relevant variables and the dynamic flow of information across the different elements of the identified neural circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It asks two main questions: (1) How are US federal regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug administration categorizing, analyzing, and regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing; and (2) What influence do other groups such as professional organizations, advocacy groups, and research institutes have on the regulation of direct-to-consumer genetics? While scholars have critically examined how genetic tests perpetuate certain identities and social categories, we know little about the processes by which genetic testing is being regulated. The present study advances our understanding of this issue in relation to three major trends occurring in biomedicine. These include a shift from genetic diagnosis to genetic risk, the redefinition of the patient as a consumer, and the de-medicalization of genetics. This project thus increases our scholarly understanding of direct-to-consumer genetic testing as it is unfolding within broader social and cultural transformations occurring in medicine and health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-method social science investigation of factors shaping federal regulations regarding direct-to-consumer genetic testing. Primary data for the project come from archival documents, interviews, and participant observations. The main goal of the project is to understand how federal agencies conceptualize and regulate direct-to-consumer advertising of genetic tests, and the relative power of outside stakeholder groups to shape federal regulations surrounding commercial genetic testing. Undertaking this research enables an enhanced understanding of ethical issues surrounding direct-to-consumer genetic testing and of how the concepts of risk, diagnoses, and genetics are used in these contexts and in the context of current transformations in medicine and health. Results will be shared with the broader community to educate citizens about the regulation of direct-to-consumer genetic testing and about the influence of stakeholders in the federal regulatory process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the reasons for this variable success is prior linguistic experience from different L1s. Moreover, the presence of multilingualism, that many adults will learn several languages over their lifetime, makes it harder to assess prior knowledge. Learning a language means becoming attuned to and developing expectations for systematic linguistic patterns, from sound sequences to grammatical relations. Successfully learning a novel language requires that adults abstract new systematic patterns from the input while using existing ones from their learned language(s). This research will help us understand language prediction and multilingual learning processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research project employs an artificial grammar learning paradigm to investigate how a particular kind of probabilistic systematic pattern, predictive dependencies, in adults' existing tense-aspect system(s) can promote or prevent adaptation to novel tense-aspect regularities. Adult participants from two L1 backgrounds, English and Thai, will learn a miniature language that expresses temporal meaning involving both English- and Thai-analogous predictive dependencies at different levels: between lexical and sub-lexical items (e.g., walk+ed) for English and between lexical items (e.g., a pair of aspect markers such as sed leew [""already completed""]) for Thai. Because the same meaning in the miniature language is equally likely to appear with both sets of dependencies, this research will investigate (1) whether participants are better able to learn predictive dependencies that are consistent with their L1-analogous dependencies and (2) whether the findings will be true under bilingual learning conditions for the English participants, who have perfect knowledge of one set of dependencies and zero knowledge of the other, and under trilingual learning conditions for the Thai-English participants, who have both sets of dependencies available for use during learning but with varying degrees of statistical precision in their L2, English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Molly J. Crockett at Yale University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating how social media environments may amplify our expression and experience of moral outrage. More specifically, this project asks whether the positive social feedback received on social media can make outrage expression more rewarding and in turn, lead to the expression of outrage. This project will contribute to an understanding of the documented growth in polarization and decline of civil discourse by identifying specific characteristics of the social media environment and psychological processes that may contribute. Results can inform the development of interventions targeting the feedback delivery system of social media and people's tendency to infer social approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to develop and test a foundational theory of moral outrage in the digital age, specifically proposing that social media environments amplify moral outrage because the positive social feedback received on social media is conducive to habit-forming outrage expression and internalization of perceived outrage expression norms. To test this theory, this project will use a multi-method approach that combines the ecological validity of studying naturally-formed social networks in social media with the precise control of experimental manipulations and reinforcement learning paradigms. This project seeks to expand psychological theory in several important ways. First, it expands upon functional theories of moral emotions in the affective sciences by articulating how the pervasive social media environment shapes the way emotions are experienced, expressed, and how their function may change. Second, this research expands theories of prosocial behavior and cooperation by highlighting how the function of moral outrage expression in the digital age may be better understood as ingroup signaling rather than norm enforcement. Third, this research expands theories of intergroup conflict by suggesting a new set of processes that may be antecedents of negative emotions felt toward certain groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this EAGER research project, methods for determining whether a skeleton was female or male based on the chemistry of tooth enamel will be developed and compared to other methods of sex estimation.  The research will expand the available suite of tools for establishing biological profiles, with the aims of validating and improving protocols and expanding the range of time periods and environmental conditions in which skeletal sex estimation can be accomplished. Findings and protocols will be shared with researchers in anthropology, chemistry, and other disciplines, and the project will support undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral student training and mentoring across the three collaborative research sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inability to accurately determine the sex of sub-adult and/or incomplete skeletons is a persistent problem in biological anthropology and forensic anthropology.

This project seeks to develop a robust, reproducible, and sensitive method for bioarchaeological and forensic sex estimation based on the detection of sexually dimorphic amelogenin peptides in human enamel, the hardest and best preserved tissue in the human body. The investigators will optimize peptide extraction from enamel, increase the sensitivity and quantification of sexually dimorphic peptides, establish a uniform protocol that can be applied as broadly as possible to archaeological material, and replicate and build on other work done in the field. The approach developed will be statistically grounded and result in sex estimation with established error and false positive and negative rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While numerous international institutions seek to protect women's rights, it remains unclear if, when, and how these institutions can effectively safeguard women?s rights. Understanding the processes by which political leaders and citizens mobilize around international women?s rights laws and institutions is critical for improving the efficacy of these institutions. Accordingly, this project will focus on state compliance with international human rights rulings and recommendations on women's rights issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the rulings and recommendations of the European Court of Human Rights, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and the UN Universal Periodic Review that are handed down to European states on issues of women's rights.

The emphasis is on those who did not migrate but become urban through city expansion as they have been the least studied to date. The questions investigated concern how people understand local belonging, which people and what places are viewed as truly urban and local, who is viewed as part of an in-group or out-group, and who is deemed worthy of local citizenship rights and shared public spaces. Findings will be useful to policy makers and other concerned parties seeking to more effectively promote social inclusion in rapidly transforming cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection for this project consists of fieldwork in a large and rapidly growing city. Spatial methods such as mental mapping exercises and city walks complement approximately 140 interviews: 40 interviews with each of the three kinds of city residents and 20 interviews with urban planning experts, drawn from different parts of the city. The interviews investigate how residents subjectively define the spatial and sociocultural boundaries that distinguish the urban and non-urban, the local and non-local, and the deserving and undeserving in their minds.

The underlying rationale for this recommendation is intuitive: a video-record provides information about deviations from best practices and may promote lineup administrator compliance with established guidelines. As much as these benefits resonate with psychological researchers, there is no research on any potential costs to video-recording. For example, it is unknown whether the act of video-recording negatively impacts witnesses' decision-making process. Furthermore, the intuitive benefits described above are likely a small subset of the potential advantages of video-recording identification procedures. The purpose of the proposed studies is, therefore, to test for possible additional benefits to video-recording that might accrue across the spectrum of an eyewitness's interaction with the justice system and to identify potential costs of the recommendation. The results from the proposed research will either provide additional support for this recommendation, thereby encouraging reluctant police departments to adopt the practice, or will highlight concerns regarding its implementation. As responsible advocates of science-based recommendations, psychological scientists must find answers to these questions in order to determine how to implement this recommendation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, an experiment tests whether video-recordings of eyewitness lineup identifications reveal different non-verbal behaviors between accurate and inaccurate witnesses, information which could be used by the legal system to assess witness reliability. In addition, the experiment tests whether witnesses make different identification decisions as a function of being recorded, as predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness decision-making. The second phase tests whether showing witnesses a video of their own identification inoculates witnesses from harmful confidence inflation produced by post-identification feedback, a potentially beneficial effect predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness confidence assessment. One experiment in this phase tests whether this effect is moderated by camera perspective; a second experiment tests whether this effect is moderated by the difficulty of the lineup task. The final phase tests whether showing fact-finders a video of an eyewitness identification procedure assists them in discriminating accurate from inaccurate witnesses. One experiment in this phase tests whether this benefit depends on fact-finders' prior beliefs about the guilt of the identified person. A second experiment tests whether an empirically-validated checklist containing information about witnesses' non-verbal cues to accuracy improves the ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate witnesses. As a whole, the proposed experiments test heretofore unexamined benefits and costs of video-recording eyewitnesses' identifications. From a practical perspective, data from these experiments can be used to develop recommendations regarding how to implement the video-recording recommendation as well as how to use those video-recordings to improve fact-finder decision-making. From a theoretical perspective, data obtained from these experiments might suggest essential refinements to models of witness decision-making and retrospective confidence reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its inception in 2008, the Institute on Collaborative Language Research (CoLang) has been a biennial venue for researchers and community language workers to receive intensive training in collaborative language research responding to the global need for quality language documentation in the face of the world-wide crisis in language endangerment. In 2020, CoLang will be held at the University of Montana (UM), co-hosted by UM and Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC -- a two-year tribal college of the Northern Cheyenne in Montana). It will bring stakeholders together to develop collaborative practices and extend networking among all participants including language workers, language activists, language teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and linguists from both academic and language communities. In partnering with each other, CoLang 2020 co-hosts (UM and CDKC) will demonstrate an Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaboration at the organizational level and encourage participation from the Indigenous communities of the United States and Canada. The Institute has continuously advanced knowledge in linguistics by its role in developing and sharing cutting edge practices in the scientific, ethical and sustainable methods for understanding the linguistic structure of the world's estimated 7,000 languages and for understanding the complex and important role language plays at the community level. Broader impacts of project activities includes the training of a wide range of audiences in skills in community-centered language documentation, supporting and building capacity at Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in STEM through the language sciences and the broadening participation of American Indians and Alaska Natives in the language sciences.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With prior Institutes held in 2008 (University of California, Santa Barbara), 2010 (University of Oregon), 2012 (University of Kansas), 2014 (University of Texas-Arlington), 2016 (University of Alaska-Fairbanks), and 2018 (University of Florida), CoLang has developed a significant track record of national and international success, and previous participants have incorporated their Institute experiences into successful fieldwork projects and community documentation activities worldwide. CoLang 2020 will devote five weeks to intensive training in collaborative approaches to language documentation. The first two weeks will consist of focused workshops and organized discussions, providing hands-on training in the latest linguistic technology, interdisciplinary methods, and best practices in ethical community collaborations. The following three weeks are dedicated to ""practica"" (intensive field methods), where students will work directly with speakers of selected endangered languages to learn documentation methods and applications first-hand, integrating the skills acquired during the preceding workshops. The Institute is at the forefront of methodology development through the intensive training facilitated by co-instructors coming from the international community of indigenous and academic experts in linguistic and interdisciplinary researchers.

Despite its size, it also contains roughly 20% (over 1,000) of the world's languages. For a vast majority of these languages, there exists no documentation. In addition, many of the languages of New Guinea are critically endangered, due in large part to the incursion of Tok Pisin, which is an English-based creole that serves as a lingua franca. Given the fact that young children are ceasing to learn heritage languages in lieu of Tok Pisin, many of the languages of New Guinea are likely to be extinct by the end of the century. The documentation and description of these languages can have a large impact for both the scientific study of language. From a scientific standpoint, the languages of New Guinea exhibit features that are rare among the languages of the world, such as the use of verbs in functions which are typologically unusual; forms of word-formation that were previously unattested; and complex strings of consonants. Understanding how these linguistic systems work can inform how languages change over time, and how populations have moved around the world. For the communities which speak these languages, the documentation can potentially represent the only record of their language and the knowledge that they contain. Due to many of these languages' endangered status, documentation and description must be undertaken now, or they will be lost forever. A broader impact of the work that will be completed is the dissertation and concomitant PhD that the researcher will obtain. All data collected will be archived in PARADISEC, an archive that specializes in languages of the Pacific. The data provided to this archive, as well as a dictionary of the language, will be openly accessible to researchers, the Heyo-speaking community, and interested members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Thomas Diaz of SUNY at Buffalo, under the advisement of Dr. Matthew Dryer, will document and describe one such language, named Heyo. Heyo is a member of the Torricelli family of languages, belonging to the Maimai branch and spoken in the northwest of Papua New Guinea. While every other of the Torricelli language family's seven branches have received some level of description and documentation, the Maimai branch has received no such treatment and remains completely undocumented. The project will consist of three major steps. First, the researcher will collect and record raw data from speakers in Papua New Guinea. This data consists of traditional narratives, naturalistic conversation, and cultural performances. After the collection of raw data, the researcher will analyze and annotate this data for linguistic phenomena, and uncover the linguistic structure of the language. In the final stages of the project, the researcher will, as a requirement for his doctoral dissertation, produce a grammatical description of Heyo. The documentation will include descriptions of typologically rare argument and gender marking; the complex system of discourse clitics; and the blurring of morphosyntactic distinctions between word classes, primarily in regards to nouns and verb. Furthermore, this project will inform knowledge of contact and borrowing patterns across genealogically disparate, but geographically close languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, most animals living at high altitude have been under strong selection to develop adaptations to these environmental challenges. Identifying adaptations in high-altitude-living animals, including non-human primates, could help illuminate the mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution of many traits. The central goal of this project is to identify these adaptations in a novel non-human primate model, the gelada monkey. The findings will advance our knowledge of how genetic changes lead to high-altitude adaptations in an important primate model system. The project will provide rigorous scientific training at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. The investigators will also engage in public outreach and international research collaborations, contributing to scientific education and conservation efforts both domestically and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an innovative, robust, and multi-disciplinary framework, combining theories and tools from evolutionary biology, genomics, molecular biology, and biological anthropology, to investigate genetic adaptations to high altitude in a non-human primate. The project has two aims: (1) to generate and use a well-annotated gelada genome and regulatory map to identify gene families that have undergone gene expansion and genes under positive selection in gelada monkeys compared to their close phylogenetic relatives, and (2) to identify candidate loci that show signatures of positive selection in high-altitude geladas. The project will identify genes and family expansions whose role in high-altitude adaptations was previously unknown or poorly understood. The project also represents the application of cutting-edge techniques for the sequencing of animal genomes from non-invasive samples, thereby encouraging genomic analyses in wild organisms historically constrained by sample availability. Recent advances in high throughput genomic technologies, including the approaches the PI and co-PI have developed, have allowed researchers to identify genes and loci under selection in captivity and the wild. Together, the results of these studies will generate new hypotheses and predictions for high-altitude and other adaptations in humans and other animals through identification of genetic variants in a novel system. By identifying novel molecular changes that allow a close primate relative to thrive in hypoxic and cold environments, this project may also have translational implications for understanding human diseases of impaired oxygen intake and transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Iron and aluminum are abundant and widely distributed, but major deposits of many other critically important metals are scarce, so these must be obtained by international trade. The southern third of the African continent is unusually rich in the rarer metals. It has the world's largest reserves of platinum, cobalt, copper and manganese, and has historically produced more gold than any other region.  Mining and metallurgy now account for a major proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most nations in central and southern Africa, but few know that mining in this region began long ago.  Iron and copper have been mined and smelted here since at least 200 AD, and gold since at least 1200 AD.  Copper objects are often found in archaeological sites far from any potential source of copper. Few citizens of southern and central African are aware of the extent of precolonial mining, or of trade in copper in this region.  The anticipated results of this project on ancient copper mining and trade will likely be widely covered in African print and electronic news media, and will be incorporated into educational materials for African schools and universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research funded by this award will study the circulation of copper within southern Africa between 200 CE to about 1700 CE.

This research will provide a novel way to study some key issues in the archaeology of southern Africa.  These include: tracing the routes taken by the earliest metal-using peoples (the Bantu migration) into South Africa; establishing when mining of specific copper deposits began; documenting trade links between the major prehistoric states in the region; and providing a new way to look at the changes that occurred in these trading systems after Europeans settled in the region, from the early sixteenth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, little is known about their effectiveness to promote technological upgrading and boost firm performance in developing countries. The existing rigorous studies about this type of intervention are focused on developed countries and high-tech industries, and infer technological improvement from patents and R&amp;D expenditure. As a consequence, lessons are hard to extrapolate to the developing country context, where innovation is concentrated on the adoption of already established technologies and on performing small modifications to existing products, which are not suitable for patenting and can be hardly considered R&amp;D. This project fills this gap in the literature by investigating the direct and indirect effects of innovation subsidies in Peru, a developing country, using directly collected data on technology use. The project opens the black box of the firm and allows to observe the changes that are triggered within a company when it receives support for innovative activities, shedding light on the mechanisms through which government support for innovation affects firm performance. The findings of this research advance understanding of the relationship between innovation subsidy programs and firm behavior, and also inform policy design in developing countries and international cooperation institutions, which have played an important role in the diffusion of interventions to promote productive development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key challenge of the project is detecting technological change in a context in which R&amp;D expenditure and patents cannot be used to do so. Given that details on productive methods used by businesses are not regularly recorded in enterprise surveys, the project includes the collection of data on productive practices used by the firms that applied to the subsidy programs under analysis. To establish a causal relationship between the innovation subsidy programs and firm behavior, the project uses a quasi-experimental method. In particular, it exploits the fact that the subsidy assignment mechanism is based on a score assigned to the applications by experts. Applications with scores above a certain threshold get a change to win the subsidies; while those with lower scores, do not. This characteristic makes the setting suitable for a regression discontinuity analysis. The project further explores spillovers operating through labor mobility and procurement relationships. These are two channels capable of transmitting information between companies and, therefore, it is worth assessing the extent to which they contribute to the diffusion of innovative ideas and of the benefits of innovation subsidies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Official records of subsequent offending will also be provided for all justice-involved participants. The proposed research is the first study of its kind to directly disentangle the potential effects of juvenile incarceration on adolescent social development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will focus on dietary iron, which is vital for life, but also presents hazards, including its availability to pathogens as well as an individual host's own cells. Hosts have evolved multiple mechanisms to withhold iron from infectious agents, and infectious agents, such as bacteria, have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to acquire iron from their hosts, resulting in an evolutionary ""arms race"" over iron. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about this ""arms race"" in a human population with high pathogen load, to understand how diet, iron nutrition, infection risk, and growth and development are related, and how humans may have adapted to high pathogen environments. The research findings may also inform public health efforts to address iron nutrition and deficiency. This international collaboration will include both field and laboratory training opportunities for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including groups under-represented in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates the impact of iron status on immunity and infection among children in a population with high rates of iron deficiency and infectious disease. Over the course of one year, participating children will be evaluated monthly for measures of diet, growth and development, iron intake, immune function and infection. The relative importance of diets as causes of iron deficiency and anemia will be described. The prevalence of impaired cell-mediated immunity and incidence of infectious diseases will be compared across iron status groups. In this manner, this study will work toward disentangling the complex interactions between diet, growth and development, iron nutrition, immunity, and infectious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, few studies examine the ways that local small businesses fare in the context of gentrification.  This project investigates how gentrification-based redevelopment impacts urban black-owned businesses compared to urban white-owned businesses. Considering that neighborhood conditions, especially in cities, are shaped by the commercial enterprises that serve the community, understanding the varied experiences of black business-ownership and white business-ownership during redevelopment will inform public discourse regarding wealth attainment, employment, and neighborhood conditions. Furthermore, this project will have practical implications for public policies aiming to encourage more inclusive redevelopment programs and to develop infrastructure that will more effectively support commercial and residential retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs a mixed-method design to address three research questions. First, the U.S. Census: Survey of Business Owners (SBO) is used to answer questions regarding the spatial and temporal trends in black and white business development in Detroit, Michigan between 1997 and 2012. These data will be used to illustrate and compare businesses in size, number of paid employees, and receipts. Second, archival material from two prominent Detroit newspapers published between 1997 and 2018 are used to examine how the incorporation of black-owned businesses in media accounts of redevelopment compare to the incorporation of white-owned businesses. Finally, through in-depth, qualitative interviews and ethnographic observation, this project investigates how black and white business-owners differ in the ways they perceive and negotiate access to and ownership over local business resources, such as capital investment, consumers, and networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Explicit knowledge is conscious-verbalizable knowledge while implicit knowledge is unconscious knowledge of language that is widely held to be a key component for fluent communicative skills. Understanding how L2 knowledge emerges and what processing activities contribute to it is an important area of L2 research that can inform how languages can best be learned and taught. It will also advance researchers' understanding of the cognitive basis of L2 acquisition and to what extent this basis differs from, or is similar to, first language acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psycholinguists have studied the relationship between and within L2 knowledge and processing for decades, yet the nature of the interface remains unclear. To demystify the interface debate, a large body of international students in the U.S. will complete a battery of five linguistic knowledge tests three times over twelve months. An untimed written grammaticality judgment test (GJT) and metalinguistic knowledge test will serve as measures of explicit knowledge whereas a timed written GJT, oral production task, and elicited imitation will be used to measure implicit knowledge. Students will also report their engagement in the L2 periodically through a mobile app. Using structural equation modeling, the proposed study addresses two research questions: (1) To what extent does explicit knowledge influence the development of implicit knowledge? (2) To what extent do the amount and type of language processing (i.e., grammar-focused and meaning-focused) contribute to the development of different knowledge types?

Small involuntary head and eye movements continually occur in the periods between voluntary relocations of gaze, even when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a single point.  These movements shift the stimulus on the retina in ways that would be immediately visible had the motion originated from objects in the scene rather than the observer's behavior.  Building on a large body of recent findings, this project investigates the hypothesis that fixational head and eye movements are not motor instabilities, but part of a precisely controlled motor strategy that facilitates the visual processing of fine spatial detail.  Elucidation of this hypothesis is important not only for advancing knowledge on the fundamental mechanisms of visual perception, but also because it implies that some visual acuity impairments may have unrecognized motor origins, and, conversely, that motor disturbances may have unsuspected sensory consequences. The research could have implications for the optimization of human visual performance in situations of restricted head movement. Also, by shedding light on how to achieve optimal sampling of visual information through coordinated movement, the research could also have implications for the design of artificial vision systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will follow an integrated theoretical and experimental approach, which combines psychophysical experiments with human subjects, statistical analysis of the stimulus on the retina, and modeling of neurons in the early stages of the visual system to examine the joint consequences of head and eye movements on the acquisition and encoding of fine spatial information.  Specifically, the investigators will measure fixational head and eye movements during the normal execution of high-acuity visual tasks. They will study how these movements interact, the degree of control involved in their interplay, and the nature of this interplay.  In parallel, the investigators will develop quantitative predictions by reconstructing the visual input signals experienced by the observers' retinas and by analyzing the impact of these signals on the responses of computational models of neurons in the visual system.  This synergy of experimental and theoretical methods will result in new knowledge in the fields of sensory perception and motor control.  It will contribute critical information on the joint characteristics of fixational head and eye movements, their visual functions, and help in identifying the sensory-motor strategies by which spatial information is represented in the brain."

In each of these examples, it would be difficult to conduct a field survey in real time, and respondents may not be able to reconstruct how they felt or behaved at the time of the event, even if interviewed just a few days later. Social media data have the potential to overcome these limitations. This project will analyze how the application of survey weighting can rebalance samples of Twitter data, and assesses how well this rebalancing will allow valid generalizations about population behaviors. The project will provide a foundation for future advances in the use of social media data for scientific, health, and applied research, thus permitting a wide variety of inferences useful in social policy formulation.

This project examines how the unidirectional movement of people and capital investment contributes to regional border economies, and how community economic networks shape settlement processes in the border region. The study also will evaluate how people that are engaged in inter-community social and economic interactions within both countries are integrated into them, and how community ties, identity, and political context affect their integration process.

In this study, X-ray imaging, 3D animation, and computer simulation methods are developed and applied to understand formation of this bipedal record. Such foundational research is required to reconstruct foot anatomy and motion from fossil footprints, and to evaluate competing evolutionary hypotheses about bipedalism. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between primarily undergraduate and major research institutions, with substantial training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Student recruitment will focus on groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Results will be translated into pedagogical materials focused on the intersection of science and visual art, and the public will be engaged through museum and media science outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies have developed methods for interpreting aspects of foot anatomy and motion from human footprints, but none have approached the problem mechanistically to understand the complex foot-substrate interactions through which footprints are formed. Direct observation of these interactions has not been possible because human feet and deformable substrates are both opaque, and contact areas are therefore hidden when a foot sinks to form a footprint. Here, biplanar X-ray, 3D animation, and computer simulation methods will be developed to visualize and analyze movement as individuals walk through substrates to create footprints. Direct mechanistic knowledge of foot-substrate interactions is potentially transformative for paleoanthropologists to extract anatomical and functional inferences from fossil human footprints and use these to test evolutionary hypotheses.

Psychological well-being is not simply the result of economic well-being; the wealthiest countries are not necessarily the happiest ones. This project involves a collaboration with researchers in 30 different countries to better understand the origins of happiness and subjective well-being. The project focuses on the concept of fundamental human motives. These motives include the satisfaction of basic physiological needs (such as hunger and thirst) along with important social needs (such as affiliation, self-protection, status, mate acquisition, mate retention, and kin care). The aim of the research is to better understand the relationship between fundamental human motives and well-being across different countries. It may be that people in poorer, but relatively happy, countries, are able to satisfy those fundamental motives, whereas people in richer, but relatively less happy, countries, are not. Preliminary research supports this conclusion, but also shows that fundamental motives are linked to happiness and well-being somewhat differently in different countries. The initial studies also suggest that some motives are linked to happiness at the national level, but not at the individual level. Governments, institutions, and corporations around the world place a high priority on improving the lives and well-being of people, because it promotes greater productivity, better health, and more cooperation among groups. The aim of this project is to gain greater insight into the factors that produce these desired outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large cross-cultural survey will be coupled with focused experimental studies to examine the factors that lead to life satisfaction, and how those are linked to fundamental human motives across different societies. The survey will include large samples from 30 countries, gathered by a network of collaborators located in each country. Using measures developed by the investigators along with other relevant variables, it will be possible to separate the contribution of fundamental social motives from the satisfaction of basic physiological needs as they contribute to psychological well-being. Experiments will then be conducted in the United States and in two other countries (one with very low scores and one with very high scores on measures of fundamental social motives), to achieve better insight into causal processes at the individual level, and how those work differently in different societies. The experiments will use a method designed to activate different motives in participants, calibrated appropriately to have similar effects in the different societies. Using fundamental social motives as a way to characterize cultures will provide new tools for scientists across a wide spectrum of disciplines who study the sources and consequences of cultural variation. The project lies at the intersection of cultural psychology, evolutionary psychology, and affective science, and will facilitate interdisciplinary training for a diverse group of students.

This project will examine the impact of recent declines in state support for public universities on scientific research output.  Since the Great Recession, several states cut appropriations to higher education, and nineteen states have not restored funding to 2008 levels.  Yet few studies have examined the relationship between federal and non-federal research funding, and none have investigated the relationship between state funding for higher education and research output.  In addition, researchers have debated whether there are diminishing returns to science funding.  Diminishing returns occur when each additional dollar of funding results in fewer publications and citations.  The results of this research will allow policymakers to make informed decisions about the allocation of scarce funding resources to higher education at the state and federal levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will examine the effect of changes in support for higher education funding to examine the returns to science funding in terms of publications and citations across science and social science disciplines. First, the project will use new data that links publications, citations and grants to individual faculty members at research universities to model the returns to scale of science funding across several disciplines. Variation across these fields will shed light on the returns to scale in science funding.  Second, the project will examine whether state funding of higher education is a substitute or complement for federal research funding in the production of research output measured by publications and citations.  If state funding is a complement for federal research funding, one would expect that federal research dollars would fall in states that experienced budget cuts.

ISAP is a forum to present the latest research on human performance problems and opportunities within aviation, envision design solutions that best use human capabilities in safe and efficient aviation systems, and bring together scientists and operators to bridge the gap between research and application.  The symposium encourages researchers to focus basic research on applied needs. The knowledge generated would not be limited to aviation applications. For example, principles of perceptual representations that could guide cockpit display designs should also apply to displays for spaceships, automobiles, nuclear power plants, and other interactive control displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium covers basic research issues on cognition, perception, and neuroscience. These topics are studied in the context of cognitive systems, human-system integration, display and visualization, training and simulation, automated and autonomous systems, personnel selection, and sociotechnical system effectiveness, as applied to aviation systems on the ground, in the sky, and in space. One common approach to reduce the often significant time lag between discovery and application is to allow practical needs to inform basic research priorities. In contrast, the philosophy of ISAP is that meaningful dialogues between researchers and practitioners are key to advancing knowledge and putting knowledge to practical use. In two companion ISAP plenary panel sessions, practitioners (e.g., pilots, air traffic controllers, maintenance personnel) present the critical safety issues that they face and researchers present the latest scientific and technological approaches to achieving solutions. These sessions are in addition to three invited plenary speakers purposely selected from different scientific disciplines and pertinent aviation domains.

This new technology also has the potential to cure as many as 6,000 genetically-inherited diseases and to transform healthcare in the U.S. At the same time, other potential applications have raised serious moral and ethical concerns. Given the wide variety of possible applications in fields ranging from medicine to national security, innovations in human gene editing (HGE) will increasingly necessitate public debate and societal decision making. However, as popular awareness of HGE grows, public discussions of the technology have the potential to become divisive in ways that could compromise meaningful and responsible development. The potential for this outcome is visible in controversies currently surrounding genetically modified organisms (GMOs), an issue that raises similar technical and ethical questions, and which has led to consumer behavior that is often at odds with the best available scientific evidence. Thus, to encourage responsible innovation, this project develops and evaluates public engagement modalities that facilitate the productive exchange of ideas about HGE between groups with different values. The findings from this project help guide broader, emerging debates about HGE and will help ensure that policy and consumer choices are shaped both by the best available science and citizens' values and concerns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish its goals, this project integrates and advances diverse strands of theory and research on biased information processing concerning science and value-laden policy issues. In particular, it tests the potential for different informational and social environments to minimize polarization in public debate. The first phase uses laboratory and survey experiments to examine how values and information together shape opinions about HGE, and to test approaches for alleviating the negative effects of information processing that is biased toward predetermined conclusions.

This project tests the idea that decision makers are more accepting of risk when they perceive that they have control over the level of risk they experience. The role of autonomy may explain why decision makers choose a small likelihood of a large outcome over a small certain alternative even though the small certain outcome is more motivating than the uncertain amount as a reward for performing an effortful task. The research findings have implications for understanding when decision makers are most willing to take on risk and for how best to incentivize performance tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decisions under risk are ubiquitous in everyday life. In some risky situations decision makers have autonomy over the risk level they experience while in others decision makers respond to an assigned risk present in the environment. This research project tests the hypothesis that autonomy increases risk tolerance such that decision makers will exhibit more risk-seeking preferences when they can choose an option than when they respond to an assigned risk. One set of studies tests the prediction that autonomy, or even just the perception of control, increases risk tolerance. That is, decision makers are predicted to have a stronger preference for risky alternatives if they perceive that they have control over the risk level they experience, even when the objective risk level is held constant between decision makers who do and do not have autonomy. A second set of studies applies the effects of autonomy to why decision makers tend to choose low probability lotteries over matched certain outcomes whereas similar lotteries do not serve as effective incentives for effort tasks relative to certain incentives. The researchers compare risk preferences revealed in choice tasks to those revealed in effort tasks with real incentives, they seek to isolate the task features responsible for the difference in risk preference, and they test whether differences in perceived autonomy can explain why decision makers will choose risky options but not work for them. Ten laboratory experiments and two field studies test the predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is no consensus inside or outside of the scientific and engineering communities about the nature, scope, and sources of such social responsibilities. This research project will conduct an international survey of scientists and engineers regarding: (1) their beliefs about their social and ethical responsibilities to society; (2) how they arrive at these beliefs; (3) the challenges and opportunities they feel affect their ability to fulfill their social responsibilities; and (4) the ways in which their attitudes and opinions differ by factors such as discipline, job sector, age, gender, institutional type, and region. The investigators will team up with overseas scientific and engineering organizations to reach a global sample of scientists and engineers from a wide variety of disciplines, nations, and cultures. This research builds directly on an earlier NSF funded study that generated a robust, pre-tested survey instrument, translated it into five languages, and created a process for recruiting a globally representative sample of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project involves administering a quantitative survey to 12,500 scientists and engineers around the world. The main aim is to procure a globally representative sample of 4,000 scientists and engineers and to gauge their opinions and attitudes about their social and ethical responsibilities to society. Doing so will enable the investigators to generate data and knowledge about how scientists and engineers from around the world perceive their social responsibilities, and how these are informed by factors such as national background, disciplinary affiliation, and other demographic characteristics. This project will advance research on scientific and engineering ethics in three main ways. First, it broadens the scope of social studies of scientific and engineering ethics beyond the university and laboratory to consider wider kinds of social responsibilities. Second, studying the factors that determine and shape scientists' and engineers' opinions also enables understanding of how to encourage members of these communities to be more socially responsible in their work. Finally, this study will provide important new tools (i.e. survey items, a global sampling protocol) for advancing future international studies of scientific ethics. Findings and data will be disseminated nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to create new opportunities for technology and knowledge transfer, and innovative conceptual development, by facilitating sustained interactions between researchers in the arts and sciences. It will bring to light how techniques such as sonification, field recording, and interactive auditory displays have the power to make research findings accessible to lay and multidisciplinary audiences, and to make science more accessible for people with visual impairments. A better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of sound as a medium for rigorous scientific work, as well as the promises and pitfalls of translating experimental sound across social groups, will serve to enhance the potential of sound technology for science communication and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will explore the emerging role of sound technology at the interface of artistic and scientific work using three case studies. The first is an historical study of the electropenetrograph (EPG), a now-standard piece of entomological equipment that initially represented data as audible noise but was eventually silenced in favor of visual techniques, such as waveforms. The second is a study of the laser vibrometry, which makes audible the vibrational ecologies of plants, insects, and agricultural researchers; it will explore the ways scientists and their non-human subjects cultivate shared perceptual worlds through the exchange of vibrations. The third is a study of the use of Max/MSP digital signal processing language to sonically represent and interact with RNA sequences (for example). The project will provide empirical, theoretical, and methodological contributions to the STS literature on sound, technology, and performativity in science. Empirically, it will provide a thick and comparative description of three areas of scientific work, each of which employs sound in a different moment of the knowledge production process. Theoretically, it will place concepts and techniques from experimental music and sound art into conversation with the literature on performativity in science. Methodologically, it will augment written ethnography with active and collaborative sound work, taking part in the production and experience of experimental sounds to provoke interdisciplinary conversations and blur the studio/laboratory distinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social scientists increasingly recognize that displacement is often long-term. Therefore, policy makers must pursue alternatives to temporary refugee camps. But to do this effectively, policy makers need more information about how displaced populations affect the economic and social conditions of the regions where they settle. Long-distance migrations to Europe have garnered recent headlines, but refugees more typically flee to nearby countries, often to regions where they or their kin have previous social relationships. As governments negotiate the distribution of responsibility for hosting these displaced populations, finding sustainable and security-appropriate solutions to today's worldwide migration crisis has become a matter of concern everywhere, including in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by City University of New York Graduate Center anthropology doctoral candidate, China Sajadian, advised by Dr. Mandana Limbert. Sajadian will undertake 12 months of research in Lebanon because Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. Over one-quarter of Lebanon's population is comprised of displaced Syrians, which makes the effects of forced migration there appropriately visible for targeted data collection and analysis. Sajadian will collect data with two primary methods. To document everyday labor practices and the specific effects of refugee settlement, she will conduct ethnographic research, including observation and interviews, among a stratified sample of 250 farmworkers in villages adjacent to the Syrian-Lebanese border. She also will pursue archival research about the history of land tenure, labor, and migration in the region. Findings from this research will inform policy makers about how loss of cross-border mobility for seasonal farmworkers reconfigures social and economic relations in the country of settlement. Knowledge of these processes will help policy makers develop approaches for dealing with refugees that are attentive to the specific predicaments, livelihood needs, and security challenges of borderland regions.

The broad goal of the program is to increase the number of faculty from under-represented populations in economics who hold tenured positions in the academy generally. The project will also focus on increasing tenured faculty in economics at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Colleges and Universities (HSCUs). DITE fellows will be mentored by distinguished professors of economics in integrating research projects, establishing a credible research portfolio and publishing and service record that will get them tenured in economic departments.  DITE will support a yearly cohort of 15 junior economics faculty over the two-year span of this proposed grant (for a cumulative total of up to 30).

Serious under-representation does not only inhibit US?s ability to create a diversified STEM workforce for the 21st century and beyond, it also skews economic research away from issues that may concern to these under-represented groups.  Because there are so few URM professors of economics, there is a greater cost to society when any single one of these professors is lost in the tenure pipeline. The DITE curriculum is designed to help URM faculty of economics decode the academy, demystify the promotion and tenure process, and identify, develop, and leverage a research program to a tenure position.

Tooth enamel from different primate species will be imaged and mechanically tested using methods from materials science engineering to better understand the relationship between the internal structure of teeth and their performance. The results of this study will illustrate the mechanisms that allow teeth to chew tough and hard foods, which may inform research to develop stronger replacements for worn and broken teeth, as well as research to better reconstruct the diet of extinct humans and animals. The study will support graduate student training and the development of undergraduate laboratory coursework that emphasizes the use of concepts from dental biology and anthropology in engineering applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address how the form of enamel contributes to its function in resisting tooth failure. At micro- and nanometer scales, enamel is formed out of many small crystals that are bundled together in complex patterns. These patterns are thought to help teeth resist wear by aligning crystals in a direction where they are strongest in response to abrasion. Additionally, a highly complex pattern of interwoven crystals is believed to help prevent cracks from moving through enamel and leading to a chipped or cracked tooth. This study combines ion beam microscopy to image micro- and nanometer structures of enamel in fine detail, and indentation methods from material science engineering to determine how enamel structures respond when forces are applied. To understand how these structures function in human teeth, the variation in their properties will be compared with those of other closely related species. For this reason, the analytical sample includes teeth from humans and a range of non-human primates including chimpanzees and baboons. Ultimately, this study will strengthen the inferences that can be made when determining diet from fossils in our evolutionary past, and help to illustrate how and why teeth break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether on the basis of gender, ethnicity, age or other markers, group-based differences in how people treat others are known to arise even when social group information is irrelevant and even when people explicitly reject social stereotypes. Despite progress in documenting these disparities, much remains unknown about their origins. The current research focuses on the role of individual human decision-making in producing societal-level outcomes. Specifically, the investigators aim to leverage complementary strengths of behavioral economics, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to uncover systematic patterns of individual human decision-making that, in aggregate, contribute to societal treatment disparities. The primary goal is to characterize the origins of unequal treatment with sufficient precision to support accurate, context-specific predictions of how people will treat members of different social groups. Support for this collaborative effort broadens access to training opportunities for aspiring scientists, provides opportunities for scientific outreach to local communities, and ultimately contributes scientific understanding of societal disparities, with implications for efforts to measure and address discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial progress has been made in documenting the existence of treatment disparities in the world. Separately, substantial progress has been made in in understanding how people think about different social groups in the laboratory. However, given the multitude of ways in which people can be categorized, and the complexity of factors influencing people's social behavior, it has been challenging to construct models of social thought and behavior that are capable of linking laboratory insights to field observations. The current research aims to connect these efforts to produce accurate predictions about when and how members of particular groups will be (dis)advantaged. Specifically, building upon evidence from cognitive neuroscience that valuation and social cognition engage separable but interacting systems, the research uses computational modeling to formally integrate psychological frameworks of how people see others (social perception) with behavioral economic accounts of how people value others' outcomes (social valuation). It then uses those models to predict how people will treat members of different social groups in laboratory and field settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

S. laws, signal their transition to adulthood, and participate in family life. We know that attitudes towards marriage have changed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as a function of evolving norms; there have also been recent changes in rates of marriage in U.S. sub-populations. Yet most of what is known about attitudes towards marriage comes from much older surveys, some of which are based on geographically limited samples.  This project examines American attitudes and sentiments toward issues of marriage, with particular focus on sub-populations whose take up rates of marriage have recently shifted. There will also be attention devoted to how marriage may be shaping adult lives and decision-making processes related to marriage in the 21st century.  Findings will help to chart how changes in attitudes towards marriage may be tied to larger societal changes in laws, attitudes, and for whom such changes are most notable.  Findings will have implications for policies relevant to supporting marriage as one foundation for social life in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates marriage attitudes in the early 21st century using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The first component will be a survey based on a national sample of 2,700 adults. The project will build on previously tested survey questions and add questions related to the experience of marriage as well as divorce. This will permit comparisons across sub-groups that vary by social characteristics. The survey will also allow comparisons across regional contexts, comparing adults in states with varying histories of marriage support. The second component will consist of interviews with 120 individuals. Interview questions will focus on explaining reasons behind attitudes and decisions to marry or opt out. The sampling strategy for the interview component allows comparisons between those living in four different social contexts, thus enriching the regional comparisons afforded by the survey data.  The findings will inform sociological theories regarding marriage, divorce, and related changes across the life course that implicate both legal rights as well as family formation and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Sociology Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will also trace the contribution of non-experts to the development of new knowledge to outline the network that connect all the contributors to the production of different types of knowledge. The study employs in-depth interviews with mobilized experts and activists, archival research, and network analysis; it includes eighteen months of field work in six GM soy producing provinces of Argentina.

Given the potential importance and complexity of the cooperation of environmental movements and environmental sciences, there is a need for research that explores this interaction within a broader scope than most case- study-based research. The study will bring together two theories about expert activism and expertise that have never been brought into conversation, and in doing so it will develop a symmetrical-network theory of expert activism. It will also implement a new symmetrical network-organizational approach to data collection and analysis, and it will test theoretical ideas developed in the US in a fundamentally different national setting in the global South.

This research investigates the ways commercially navigable inland waterway systems temporarily reconfigure  after a disruptive incident. Specifically, how does the system balance prioritization of recovery objectives and development and implementation of appropriate solutions? This balancing is a function of the system?s ability to self re-organize with respect to the relationships among asset owners, operators, and stakeholders. The effectiveness of this reorganization is largely dependent upon the cultural and physical characteristics present in the system. Therefore, this research provides insights that will enhance the response processes involved, and potentially lead to quicker and more effective recovery efforts. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To investigate and elucidate these patterns of self reorganization, the graduate student completes case studies of the ports of Baltimore, New Orleans, and Rotterdam.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Melissa Emery Thompson at the University of New Mexico, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the effects of differences in women's occupations on their household economies and physiological states, as well as the heath of themselves and their children. Most women in the United States and around the world engage in occupations that are more compatible with childcare than men's occupations and also that are less economically risky than men's occupations. However, some women do choose occupations that are neither compatible with childcare nor low risk, but very little is understood about what leads women to choose those types of occupations and what the outcomes are for women and their families. In order to better understand why some women choose these types of occupations and others choose more traditional ones, this project will conduct a study with women whose primary occupations represent this range. The goal of the project is to learn about potential positive and negative outcomes that result from different women's occupations in order to understand women's economic choices across different cultures. In doing so, factors that may buffer women and their children against more negative potential outcomes will be explored as well. The results of this project will be critical as women's roles in the household, local, and global economy continue to expand. It will also contribute to that expansion by employing and training women from underrepresented communities in social and lab-based sciences.<br/><br/>The sexual division of labor is a hallmark of human societies that requires men and women to trade off allocation of individual time and energy between productive work and childcare. While evolutionary explanations for sex differences in these activities are rooted in the different reproductive roles of males and females, suggesting less flexibility for women than for men, empirical evidence suggests a great deal of variability in women's behavior. This project will highlight variability in women's productive work and risk preferences within a society where women show considerably more occupational variability and engage in significant risk-taking economic behavior. We will use a robust between- and within-individuals study design that employs mixed data collection methods in order to characterize behavioral and physiological flexibility and the costs and benefits for employing particular work and childcare strategies. The scope of this project will contribute to theory and knowledge about the evolutionary importance of variation in women's tradeoffs in three specific ways: 1) Results will challenge a pervasive notion in evolutionary theory about the human sexual division of labor with a case study of women who exhibit cross-culturally rare subsistence and parenting behavior; 2) Physiological correlates of behavior will shed light on the function of women's productive strategies and risk preferences; 3) Economic and health outcomes of women's productive strategies and risk preferences will tease apart costs and benefits of these behaviors and determine the nature of tradeoffs made by women. The broader goal is to contribute to a more comprehensive socioecological model of the human sexual division of labor that foregrounds the variability of women's tradeoffs in their familial and societal roles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to promote the idea that an increased knowledge of linguistics, as a science, can benefit TCU programs related to indigenous language sustainability as well as the idea that linguistics can benefit from community input. The indigenous languages spoken in Montana are from four different families: Algonquian, Salishan, Siouan, and Kootenai, an isolate. Because of this, the proposed project will advance our knowledge of the linguistics of these languages. The project is also innovative in applying collaboration among linguists and community language researchers, a method known as Community Based Research (CBR) in a way that fosters and enhances our understanding of these languages' phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax and semantics through the lens of traditional environmental knowledge and ethnosciences. A collaborative team, consisting of four language activists from indigenous communities and four non-indigenous linguists, will travel to TCUs in Montana to learn about the current efforts and future goals of their language activities. The collaborative team will then host meetings with selected participants from the Montana TCUs for further discussions. Results will be compiled from these activities feed into future documentation research and indigenous language education through workshops that will circulate the information back to indigenous communities. These project outcomes have the potential to implement indigenous ways of knowing into language documentation projects."

Human migration flows across borders is matched by financial (remittances) and communication counter-flows that sustain both the migrant at their destination and their families at their origin.  Remittances sent by migrants are commonly used to meet basic consumption needs and for investment in education and housing, but they are also a key resource that communities mobilize in the aftermath of natural disasters.  While it is generally understood that remittances constitute an important source of household income and contributor to community development projects, particularly during disaster recovery, what is less understood is the role of women in the decision-making about the use of remittances during such recoveries.  This project will inform the understandings of how remittance management is organized at the local level, specifically women's roles in decision-making, and has the potential to inform policy to be more attuned to the significance of the role of women in remittance management, especially in post-disaster recovery situations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising doctoral student.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project advances knowledge on how global migration and finance flows rely upon and rework family networks and local communities.  It will do so by answering two central research questions.  First, it assesses how a community manages remittances in the context of other financial and resources inputs, especially when stressed due to a natural disaster.  Second, it investigates how negotiations over remittances are transforming the lives of women.  Specifically, this research project will analyze (1) the precise ways that remittances are managed after a natural disaster; (2) how women participate in remittance management at the household and community level; and (3) how the process of negotiating the use of remittances is transforming the responsibilities, labor, and social involvement of women in communities.  The doctoral student will combine a comprehensive household survey with qualitative methods such as archival research, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews in a case study of the post-earthquake recovery in Oaxaca, Mexico.  The research will contribute new theoretical insights on the relationship between gender, labor, and citizenship as well as generate new findings on how global migration and remittance flows are mobilized by family networks and local communities in post-disaster situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Roger,P,Levy,rplevy@mit.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,03/01/2019,02/28/2021,18414.00,"Natural language often gives speakers multiple ways to convey the same meaning. Meanwhile, linguistic communication takes place in the face of environmental and cognitive constraints. When multiple options are available to express more or less the same meaning, what general principles govern speaker choice? Advancing our understanding of this question can potentially enhance a broad array of human language technologies, such as providing more human-like language generation with better understanding of speaker choice, more accurate machine translation, better resources for language learning and teaching, as well as insights to improve treatment for language disorders. <br/><br/>Within this broader research program, this project focuses on the influence of contextual predictability on the encoding of linguistic content manifested by speaker choice in a classifier language. In English, a numeral modifies a noun directly (e.g., three tables). In classifier languages such as Mandarin Chinese, it is obligatory to use a classifier (CL) with the numeral and the noun (e.g., three CL.flat table, three CL.general table). While different nouns are compatible with different specific classifiers, there is a general classifier 'ge' (CL.general) that can be used with most nouns. This study focuses on the alternating options between using the general classifier versus a specific classifier with the same noun where the options are nearly semantically invariant. The use of a more specific classifier would reduce surprisal at the noun, but the use of that more specific classifier may be dispreferred from a production standpoint if accessing the general classifier requires less effort. This project combines corpus analyses, psycholinguistic behavioral experiments and computational modeling using techniques from statistics, natural language processing, and experimental psychology, examining how language users allocate resources to prepare them to produce and comprehend language, shedding lights on why language is structured in the way it is.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A myriad of reasons for low female participation in engineering have been investigated, such as pay and promotion opportunities and family-related constraints. Attention has also been given to the role of workplace discrimination, as women in STEM experience discrimination at higher rates than women in non-STEM disciplines. However, few researchers have focused their attention on how the day-to-day experiences of women in engineering might facilitate or impede discriminatory behavior. While many of the existing studies on workplace discrimination have focused on the individual or the organization, we argue that teams play an overlooked role in women's experiences in engineering. Taking a team-centric approach, we examine interpersonal discrimination and its multi-level ripple impact on both individual and team outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is designed to complete three high-level objectives. Our first objective is to identify whether and how engineering team experiences differ by gender, specifically in relation to team discrimination. As a second objective, we will examine the effect team discrimination has on engineering team outcomes (e.g., performance, creativity). Finally, our third objective is to examine the impact team discrimination has on individual-level outcomes and specifically the career trajectory of female engineers. To effectively carry out the stated objectives, we will use complementary methods to conduct two primary studies. We will begin with a multilevel, longitudinal examination of discrimination in STEM teams, specifically in relation to female team members. This first study will address the concern regarding a lack of longitudinal, team-level data and provide insight regarding an understudied phenomenon, team discrimination. We follow with an experience sampling study examining team discrimination toward females working within the STEM field and the effects of such occurrences throughout their daily lives and long-term career aspirations and decisions. The culmination of this program will provide a greater understanding of how team experiences shape the career path for women in STEM, with the overall goal of retaining women in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The loss of a language entails a loss of cultural and intellectual wealth both for its community of speakers and for a scientific community for whom linguistic diversity provides a vital natural laboratory for understanding the nature of human language as a whole.  This project investigates unique and scientifically significant sentence structures of a language still spoken by a speech community of reasonable size, but facing clear signs of future threat due to the encroachment of English and larger regional languages:  B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave; (bwu), a Gur (Mabia) language spoken in Sandema, Ghana. In many disciplines, abstract elements are posited but not directly observable, such as quarks in physics. B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave; has the potential to reshape our understanding of abstract syntactic elements posited in linguistics.  The impetus for this project is the discovery of overt elements in the language B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave; that appear to be the counterpart of elements that are hidden in (most) other languages of the world.  The investigation of this phenomenon requires observing and analyzing these elements as used by actual speakers of the language in Ghana, since the language is underdocumented. Broader impacts include the training of a dissertation student. In addition, for the local community of speakers, this project will aid local educators by laying a foundation for the future development of pedagogical materials, including an introductory grammar book. this project falls in the national interest by strengthening the existing close relations between the U.S. and Ghana, especially between educational and scientific institutions. The importance of the Ghanaian people and their diverse cultures to the United States more generally is evidenced by the fact that three presidents since 1998 have visited Ghana &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns subordinate clauses in B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave;, which have been discovered to have several surprising properties. The most striking discovery concerns the fact that certain controversial abstract elements that have been proposed as part of the grammar of languages like English are overt and pronounced in B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave;.  In particular, the unpronounced subject position of certain infinitival clauses in English has been claimed to be occupied by an element that is present in the mental representations of speakers despite being unpronounced.  This proposal is important to our understanding of the laws that govern the structure of sentences in general, but because it has complex consequences, some researchers have advanced theories that dispense with unpronounced subject positions.  In B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave;, however, some (but interestingly not all) of the positions for which a silent subject has been posited for English are occupied by an overt pronoun.  The presence of this pronoun appears to argue in favor of the universality of a requirement that all clauses have a structural subject, but hypotheses concerning the details of its distribution and testing of these hypotheses will show whether this conclusion is supported or not.  These discoveries concerning B&amp;ugrave;l&amp;igrave; have the potential to shape our entire understanding of how clauses (basic building blocks of language) are formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Food production is one of the most significant developments in the history of the human species. It has long been acknowledged as setting the stage for virtually all subsequent cultural developments by increasing the carrying capacity of land, the degree of sedentism that is possible as well as greater population density. As a result, the production of food was a required prerequisite for the establishment of urban life. Food production is also necessary to underwrite the division of labor within society that allowed farmers to support ever-increasing numbers of non-producers such as political rulers, engineers and scientists. Changes in climate are often posited as resulting in cultural collapse, but is evaluated in this research for its role in the intensification of food production. This project is significant in advancing basic understanding of interactions between the origins of human food production and tropical forest ecology in response to climate change in Mesoamerica, one of the small number of locations in the world where agriculture independently developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Rosenswig and his team will examine how drying environmental conditions impact human subsistence practices and how intensified food production, in turn, impact local vegetation patterns. The reconstruction of human occupation and forest floral species diversity in the tropical lowlands of northern Belize, Central America will be reconstructed from 4000-1000 BC to document how food production and settlement patterns were impacted by the changing climate and, in turn, how local vegetation was reconstituted. This will be accomplished by combining: 1. archaeological excavation that documents human habitation; 2. lake sediment coring to reconstruct changing patterns of plant pollen from economically useful species and 3. charcoal that result from human burning of local vegetation to increase soil productivity. Research will focus on the so-called ""4.2k BP Event"" that caused three centuries of climate disturbance world-wide between 2200 and 1900 BC.

When it comes to democratization, some states have employed measures to involve citizens in co-participation in matters of security, with the objective of bringing citizens closer to police forces. Other states, however, have opted for militarizing their provision of security, separating citizens even farther from the police. In these last 30 years, militarization has been easier than democratization because in some countries, citizens trust the military more than they do the police, even in countries where military dictatorships took place. This study examines whether separating citizens from those who provide their security also distances citizens from other parts of the state. The decision to either democratize or militarize citizen security affects what citizens think about and do in relation to state institutions, impacting citizen-state linkage. Importantly, the way politicians speak about citizen security affects the different ways decisions of policing are taken and how citizens also make their minds about it. Thus, this study has a broader impact in showing how, from rhetoric to decision-making to implementation, the way politicians approach policing will ultimately forge citizens' investment in political participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to several debates in political science. First, it directly speaks to the burgeoning literature on policing by examining how politicians' decisions and rhetoric on security provision directly impact the linkage between citizens and the state. This study argues that said impact is reflected in citizen attitudes towards democratic and militarized security as well as their participation in security co-production. Second, it contributes to the literature on state capacity and governance by better theorizing the connection between preferences in security decision-making, institutional capacity, and citizen attitudes and behavior. Third, it adds to the literature on militarizing law enforcement by taking a novel approach to militarized security from the citizens' perspective and focusing on how attitudes towards militarizing or democratizing law enforcement change. Lastly, it adds to the literature on political participation by testing whether achieving security co-production relies on other types of political participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many economic and social interactions are well ""described as two"" sided markets. Examples include matching students to schools, residents to hospitals and workers to firms. Economists have studied all of these situations using the tools of economic theory. This research typically assumes that all parties know the consequences from any possible match, so that participating individuals can evaluate the benefits of any possible match. This assumption is not very realistic. For example, colleges do not directly know the ability of applicants. They do however have access to tests (such as the SAT) and other signals of ability. When applicants understand that tests and other signals will be used to assess underlying ability, they will prepare for the tests as well as attempt to manipulate the signals. This raises the possibility that such test preparation will make it more difficult for schools to accurately evaluate the ability of applicants, leading to schools using additional criteria to evaluate students (such as extracurricular activities). Applicants will of course respond to this by changing their extracurricular behavior. The result is an arms race with colleges looking at various school extracurricular activities, athletic participation, violin compositions, starting charities, etc. Students then engage in these activities because even though their signaling value is small when everyone is doing so, not engaging becomes a negative signal. A similar dynamic may exist in job markets. This award will fund research to understand  the underlying forces that govern this kind of strategic interaction between organizations who choose the criteria by which to evaluate applicants and the response of applicants to increasingly more demanding criteria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic model will be a two-sided market of incomplete information. One side (applicants) have privately known abilities while the other side (schools or firms) use signals to infer the ability of students. In the absence of test preparation, standard positive assortative matching will match higher signaling students with higher quality schools. Test prep is a strategic choice by students that influences the inferences schools will make about ability, quite possibly decreasing the informativeness of the test. The decreased informativeness of test scores leads schools to add additional signaling variables related to ability, for example, taking advanced placement (AP) courses. While in the absence of manipulation, having taken AP courses might be informative about ability, once students learn that colleges pay attention to this, many students who have no interest in those courses may take them to ""signal"" their ability. This decreases the informativeness of this signal, just as test prep decreased the informativeness of tests. A central focus of the investigation is the endogeneity of potential signals chosen by the uninformed schools. Understanding the nature of this endogeneity will shed light on the vulnerability to manipulation of different activities and so the stability over time of equilibrium sets of signaling activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While previous archaeological studies have explored this phenomenon in the context of subjugated Native populations, few have considered how the independent development of ""pericolonial"" pastoral traditions spurred societal changes among unconquered indigenous groups. The non-coerced adoption of sheep by Navajo frontier communities in 17th and 18th century New Mexico and the subsequent evolution of an intensely pastoral lifeway that continues to this day stand out as unique sociocultural developments in the Southwest. The ENPLP will investigate the mechanisms by which early Navajos successfully negotiated the entry of Old World domesticates and their attendant social and landscape impacts while remaining free from Spanish hegemony. This work will allow the researchers to examine the complexity of Navajo societal responses to more than four centuries of Euro-American colonialism in the Southwest, as well as contribute an important long-term perspective to ongoing efforts to preserve and sustain traditional Navajo culture. Such work has the potential to prove significant for researchers outside the American Southwest exploring an array of anthropological topics including pastoralism, colonialism, and indigenous identity politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ENPLP will examine the pericolonial impacts of incipient pastoralism on the social organization and settlement patterns of early Navajo communities in the Dinétah region of northwest New Mexico. The oldest known center of Navajo settlement in the Southwest, Dinétah was the center of a number of sociocultural shifts in Navajo society during the Gobernador Phase (c. AD 1626-1775), including population growth, fortress construction, and migration away from the region. Although previous researchers have suggested these changes are related to the rise of Navajo sheepherding practices following Spanish colonization circa AD 1600, this relationship remains poorly understood. The ENPLP will employ a collaborative three-phase research program involving both Native and non-Native archaeologists to address these questions. In Phase One, the participant-observation of modern sheepherding practices on the Navajo Nation will be used to identify interpretive analogs for early Navajo pastoral land use. Phase Two will build on the ethnoarchaeology to create a geospatial model for early Navajo pastoral site location and land use. Phase Three will employ intensive site mapping and geoarchaeological testing to distinguish potential Navajo pastoral sites by identifying nearby corral-related dung deposits in the Dinétah region. These data will be combined with archival data from previous Cultural Resource Management projects in order to determine the spatial and material correlates of Gobernador Phase Navajo pastoral sites. Together this information will be used to assess the extent, intensity, and type of herding strategies employed by Gobernador Phase Navajo groups in Dinétah, as well as evidence for social differentiation based on access to livestock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These risks are often highly localized and therefore avoidable. Many Americans depend on well water that often is below the standards set by regulatory actions pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. One approach to reduce contaminants is to rely on the government to mitigate these risks and reduce the welfare impact of adverse outcomes through the provision of local public goods, including safe drinking water and health services. Government provision of such public goods, however, is not always adequate. The assumptions underlying this project is that such limitations may be overcome by (a) exploiting private risk to achieve greater cooperation, building upon the ""veil of ignorance"" concept of John Rawls to foster cooperation for public goods; (b) departing from the pitfalls of either extreme of public or private goods only by focusing on sharing of privately-owned resources; and (c) exploring how information and social-networks increase cooperation as well as encouraging private investments in mitigation technologies. To test these concepts, the researchers have chosen as context a major disaster of natural origin: toxic levels of arsenic in groundwater pumped by millions of private wells across Bangladesh. Information on individual risk, in this case well tests for arsenic, are provided in ways that encourage greater cooperation and investment through the sharing of safe wells and the installation of new safe wells. The findings have implications for environmental policy in the United States as high-resolution data on water, air, and soil quality become increasingly accessible to citizens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this research studies the role of risk-sharing and social networks in perception and mitigation of local environmental risks. The research team focuses on two aspects: increasing cooperation for risk mitigation and increasing private investment in risk mitigation technology. This project is based in a setting where these two factors become particularly important due to a lack of government-provided resources for reducing environmental risk. The research first tests whether informal insurance, where compliance may be primarily enforced by existing social structure and reciprocity norms, can effectively counter the undersupply of local public goods. Then, the team studies how social-networks can help in increasing cooperation, adoption and investment in risk mitigation technology. To understand the channels, this project explores  how information on risk can facilitate more cooperation and risk mitigation. This relatively low-cost approach is different from the current approach of the government of Bangladesh which is focused on expensive infrastructure of limited reach. The study is a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, where the researchers randomly assign interventions on (a) ex-ante risk sharing, (b) information provision on risk, and (c) the demonstration of intermediate-depth wells which yield low arsenic. The original data allow the research team to test the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of mitigation efforts and reduction in arsenic exposure to the population.

Lisa,,Pearl,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities,09/01/2018,12/31/2020,148000.00,"This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and supported by SBE's Science of Learning program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Lisa Pearl at the University of California, Irvine, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating children's understanding of pronouns. Pronouns are highly dependent on both grammatical information and contextual information, making them an ideal test case in which to study children's developing ability to integrate multiple pieces of information. Linguists have fairly well-developed theories about how pronominal morphology, pronominal form, and discourse connectives contribute individually to deciding what a pronoun refers to, but far less is understood about how these pieces of information are combined in the mind of the listener, and even less is known about how the child listener decides which pieces of information to prioritize. The question is further complicated by the fact that some of these cues are probabilistic, meaning that they favor but do not require certain pronoun interpretations, and by the fact that their abundance in the input varies across different dialects of the same language. Understanding how children's cue integration mechanism works and how it reacts to statistical variation can inform theories of language change and cognitive development. It can also be useful for diagnosing atypical development and inform efforts at improving school readiness through interventions in the quantity and quality of children's input. <br/><br/>This project encompasses a series of coordinated experimental, corpus, and computational modeling studies. Phase 1 uses experimental and corpus methods to pinpoint the age at which children first become sensitive to three specific cues. (i) Verbal agreement morphology, (ii) intra-clausal semantic relations or discourse relations, and (iii) pronominal form (null vs. overt pronouns), have all been found to influence pronoun interpretation in Spanish. Phase 2 addresses the question of cue integration by tracking how children rank these cues relative to one another across ages 3, 4, and 5, using experimental methods. Phase 3 addresses the question of how children can potentially extract these rankings from their input, and whether inter-dialectal differences in the input lead to different ranking outcomes. Corpus work will first determine the distribution of each cue in the input that children receive. Next, a computational model will be used to estimate the weight assigned to each of these cues, based on their distribution in the input and children's observed ranking behavior from Phase 2. This model will provide a precise, quantifiable proposal for how children weight each cue and how these weights change over the course of development. The novelty of this approach lies in bringing together established insights from different theoretical domains (morphosyntax, discourse pragmatics, sociolinguistics) to show how they can not only coexist but also interact in the mind of the learner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Nathan,S,Rose,nrose1@nd.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,09/01/2019,08/31/2024,750883.00,"There is a significant need to advance understanding of the basic neurocognitive mechanisms that enable the human mind and brain to accomplish the tasks of encoding, retaining, and retrieving information in working memory in the service of goal-directed actions. These mechanisms are fundamental for cognition, and dysfunction with some of these processes likely underlie age-related memory deficits over both the short term and the long term. This project will help clarify how information retained in working memory is reactivated in younger and older adults, and how the consolidation of these memories, which are volatile over the short term, may be enhanced with noninvasive brain stimulation over the long term. This project will also build educational and outreach activities, to students and older adults, through community-based learning programs about memory, aging, and the brain. The project will also provide student trainees with a unique set of research skills that will help catapult them towards advanced work in a variety of STEM-related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objective of the research project is to identify the mechanisms that enable the reactivation of information that is passively retained in working memory - that is, information that is not in an individual's current focus of attention, or what is called ""latent working memory."" The hypothesis is that applying noninvasive brain stimulation (specifically, transcranial magnetic stimulation) to sensory (visual) regions of the brain while participants are passively retaining latent information in visual working memory will reactivate stimulus-specific features of the information whereas stimulating regions of frontal-parietal cortex will reactivate the task goals/rules (i.e., which memory the participant is to be attending to at that particular time), and strengthen the consolidation of these memories. The hypotheses will be tested in experiments using new technologies and innovative methods to safely manipulate brain activity and decode memory representations from simultaneously recorded neuroimaging signals using artificial intelligence, machine-learning algorithms. At the conclusion of this project the PI will have shown causal evidence for the roles of frontal, parietal and sensory regions in storing and reactivating latent working memories in both older and young adult humans. This basic research will facilitate the development of techniques that have the potential for widespread translational applications for enhancing learning and memory functioning in young and older adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines PCAST and its impact on U.S. federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) policy through the lens of its membership. The research team is building and analyzing a repository of materials related to PCAST - personal communications and archival collections - and conducting and publishing oral history interviews with PCAST members. This data will be used to develop policy recommendations for future White House STEM advisory bodies, determine best practices, identify areas of improvements, and raise overall awareness of PCAST's role and, more broadly, the role of STEM in developing public policy. The data and research products will be assembled into a comprehensive, publicly accessible library of PCAST materials to inform policymakers, science historians and sociologists, the STEM research community, and the broader public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PCAST is led by the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), commonly referred to as the president's ""science advisor,"" and up to two other non-federal members from the STEM community. Created in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush, PCAST advises the president on a broad range of issues related to STEM including national and domestic security, workforce and the economy, energy and the environment, and public health and medicine. The council, with its high-profile membership and proximity to the president, has historically played a central role in shaping federal STEM policy and maintaining the overall health of the nation's STEM enterprise. However, determining the full impact of PCAST across the broad spectrum of policy issues related to STEM is challenging from the public record alone. The President's Scientists compiles and analyzes data beyond PCAST's public reports, including all White House communications regarding PCAST; transcripts and minutes from PCAST meetings; and any available other relevant materials concerning PCAST from presidential archives and collections of science advisors. In addition, the team is conducting a series of oral history interviews with select former PCAST members, chosen based on their demographics, areas of expertise, and the administration they served, to have an inclusive and diverse sample. The interviews will highlight members' perspectives on PCAST, as well as their personal histories in STEM before and after their tenure on the council. The goal is to understand the full extent of PCAST's influence, how it has been utilized under each president and shifting political conditions, and how it interfaces with other policy bodies across the government and in the broader STEM community to build consensus and promote its recommendations. This research will result in a comprehensive, publicly-accessible documentation of PCAST, as well as best practices and policy recommendations for PCAST and other future White House STEM advisory councils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It seeks to identify when, how, and under what circumstances individual immigrants acquire positive attitudes toward democratic values, institutions, and toward the receiving country.  This is a topic of great importance, as it is clear that not all immigrants adopt pro-democratic values, as evident by instances of hostility on the part of immigrants directed at the receiving country.  The project will study refugees in order to assess their attitudes toward the host country upon their arrival, and then subsequently track the respondents' attitudes over time.  With an increasing number of individuals seeking to flee their home countries to move to advanced democracies, the topic is timely and important. By assessing how immigrants acquire (or fail to acquire) pro-democracy attitudes, the research is poised to help determine strategies to help integrate the new arrivals into democratic society.  Successful programs that foster integration can help to reduce the negative consequences often associated with large influxes of refugees. Those findings would be of great values to both the scholarly and policymaking communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This proposal studies how, when, and why some immigrants successfully integrate into democratic societies, while others do not.  The research design allows for the investigators to evaluate the immigrant respondents' attitudes toward democracy upon arriving in the receiving country, and subsequently at multiple points over time.  Unlike previous studies, the team is able to study refugees fleeing a specific country, but who ultimately end up dispersed across multiple advanced democratic countries. This will allow the team to assess how different conditions across countries may contribute to the successful integration of immigrants and the adoption of pro-democratic values by these immigrants.  To do so, the team will utilize state-of-the-art cellular technology, an experimental research design, and a panel data survey design to assess the success or failure of host states to integrate newly arrived immigrants.  By identifying factors that contribute to successful integration efforts that foster democratic values among newly arrived immigrants, this research will provide valuable insights to scholars who study civic values and political socialization.  Likewise, the findings will be of great importance for policymakers who must design appropriate and effective integration programs and policies for particular immigrants to their country."
Robert,,Holahan,rholahan@binghamton.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,05/01/2019,05/31/2023,226482.00,"Scholars have long been interested in the linkages between governance institutions and the sustainability of common-pool resources (CPRs), of which oil and gas are canonical examples. Institutions that facilitate efficient collective action are often seen as the best hope for a solution to the tragedy of the commons, and the long endurance of institutions is often viewed as a best-case scenario. Long-enduring institutions, however, lock participants in to a particular path that may or may not be efficient when exogenous changes occur. This project expands on the intellectual tradition of CPR scholars by examining how a solution to a dilemma today can exacerbate a different CPR dilemma tomorrow. The problem with such institutions is not necessarily the possibility of resource collapse (i.e., a tragedy of the commons), but rather of continued action in the face of substantially changed circumstances. CPR governance institutions can continue to be used to facilitate collective action long after collective action ceases to be efficient or equitable for the group. Previously stable and efficient institutions may now have the effect of redistributing rents from those who are least vulnerable to the new risks introduced by an exogenous shock to those who are most vulnerable. This research examines the changing implications of oil and gas production and regulation in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How effective are existing regulations at managing the risks from high volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF), commonly known as ""fracking?"" HVHF is a technique for producing oil and gas from shale formations that has revolutionized the domestic energy landscape. In the U.S., states are the primary regulators of oil and gas production, so there is variation in the types of and effectiveness of regulations in-use. Many of these regulations were enacted in the early-to-mid 1900s and were designed to manage conventional oil and gas production. Given the rapid expansion of HVHF across the country, this research explores the effects of these regulations and HVHF production techniques. The project first develops a cross-state database of current regulations used to manage oil and gas production, which will be available online for the public, state regulators, journalists, and academics to explore how different states manage oil and gas production and how effective those regulations are. Second, the project engages landowners in focus groups to better understand the perspectives of people impacted, both positively and negatively, by the HVHF boom. Third, the project uses a series of laboratory economic experiments to advance scholarly understanding, in a controlled setting, of how different regulations incentivize individual decisions whether to sign leases to allow oil and gas production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Alisa,,Fryar,ahicklin@ou.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,03/15/2018,02/29/2020,60284.00,"Public universities face many challenges in their efforts to operate within an environment that is both dominated by political influences and subject to the pressures of market-based competition for necessary resources. Disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. The short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. Especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. This study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. We hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies. This project seeks to examine how these dynamics play out in disaster recovery efforts for public higher education institutions and their students. We will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. The study site is Lamar University in Beaumont, TX. The administrative interviews focus on the ways in which efforts to accommodate and support those affected by the storm were influenced by accreditation-related constraints (in this case, from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) and concerns about the effects on funding streams (tuition revenue, state appropriations, and federal financial aid). The quantitative analysis examines how the decisions immediately following the storm affected student enrollment and persistence and the extent to which these effects vary by student-level risk factors or level of storm damage for the individual's household.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research develops a codebase in modelling heterogenous decision makers using recent advances in theory and computation. The developed toolkit will include codes, extensive documentation in the form of notebooks, as well as teaching materials. The developed codebase will provide researchers and policy makers a useful toolkit in considering heterogenous households by simplifying the computation and estimation of complex macroeconomic models.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research on heterogenous agent models leverages new advances on the computation of equilibria in sequence space by jointly solving the equations characterizing equilibrium across all periods for time paths of the unknowns, given initial conditions on the distribution and other states.

The developed toolkit will require as input the equations characterizing equilibrium, including specification of heterogeneous-agent ?blocks?. The toolkit will then automatically perform computation of steady state and transition dynamics for given shocks. Extensions will allow estimation as well as computation of optimal policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through most of an individual's life, access to science material will happen outside of a school setting, making informal science environments such as science museums an important resource for creating and maintaining interest and access to science throughout the lifespan. The goal of this research project is to examine how Language Science can promote better understanding of science as a process and can spark interest and excitement for science in a museum setting. Language Science is predicted to be especially effective because of its natural fit with evidence-based practices of informal science teaching and learning.  Moreover, we predict that it will help create an entry point for science among individuals who do not identify with classic scientific fields. This project will help us better understand how different kinds of activities and topic areas influence the public's understanding of and attitudes towards science, and it will potentially help us identify a bridge to bring more people into the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to examine how effective a variety of different Language Science outreach activities (including participation in live research) are at fostering (1) understanding of scientific content, (2) understanding of the nature of science (e.g. science as a process), and (3) interest and excitement to learn more about science. Observational and survey-based studies will be conducted at the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) in Columbus, Ohio.  The Language Science activities will be drawn from the set of those currently in use at the Language Sciences Research Lab at the museum and include a range of language topics and types of interactivity with the public. Responses to these activities will be compared to a broad base-line survey of museum visitors, as well as parallel observational and survey-based studies examining non-language science activities at the museum. Survey items will include a range of demographic questions and questions about scientific knowledge, training, and interest. These studies will allow us to determine which approaches and topics are most effective at promoting positive science understanding and interest, and especially the extent to which Language Science is comparable to other scientific domains. Of particular interest will be the responses of individuals with lower levels of science background and interest.

This RAPID award will support stabilization efforts and data collection in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria from the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico and the free-ranging monkey groups that live there.  This project preserves important short-term data during a critical, immediate post-storm period when vegetation and water are limited, landscapes have been changed, but marine resources are more abundant. These data will allow the testing of several hypotheses regarding severe environmental change on behavior and biology. The monkey colony has been well-studied for 79 years, and pre-storm data integrating behavior, genetics and morphology are abundant. These data have been foundational for advances in biological anthropology, primate ecology, cognitive science, and related medical fields. Importantly, this RAPID will support preservation of the Cayo Santiago macaques themselves, by repairing the island water cisterns and feeding corrals. This scientifically necessary infrastructural support provides societal benefits by creating a context in which Cayo staff and local student researchers, all of whom are under-represented minorities, can continue their work. Public access to the research results will be provided through partnership with an NSF-funded science mentoring program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key to understanding, modeling and mitigating the influence of severe change on humans and nonhuman primates is the combination of quality pre-event data, immediate post-event data, and long-term follow up data.  The investigators will pursue several key research questions related to modeling the influence of severe environmental and dietary perturbation on individual plasticity and survival.   These questions provide key information for studies in the deep past (human evolution) as well as prospective modelling for better outcomes in future events.  Hurricane Maria offers scientific opportunities to test the effect of severe environmental change on behaviors and bodies, precisely because Cayo Santiago has been a rich and foundational resource for long term behavioral study.  Primate populations of precise known lineage (pedigree) are rare, and the Cayo Santiago macaques are unique in being free-ranging populations with a long documented history and rich behavioral, genetic and anatomical research programs.  The PIs will collect data (resource surveys &amp; isotopic baseline values, animal uptake values) that allow evaluation of post-storm behavior and the consequences of the forced dietary change (from reliance in the first post-storm periods on washed-in marine resources, to greater vegetation and provisioning) with direct relevance to hypotheses about human evolution.  Through daily census and observation data, they will assess survival and positioning of social groups and response to shifting landscapes (including passage of the submerged isthmus between islands).  These data will add insight to future models of the effects of environmental degradation.  The ability to collect these data, as well as ongoing and future long-term studies, requires the survival of the colony.  Without the immediate interventions supported here, the comparative science is impossible, the survivors will likely die and the long-term scientific advances that build from them will be terminated."

The research examines how the language of hateful speech and its dissemination over social networks predicts hate crimes. The scientific goal is to inform and advance theory and basic understanding of the social and cognitive processes that underlie extreme and hateful thoughts and how they spread. One aim is to identify mechanisms that might inhibit the dissemination of hate speech in social media. Another is to provide new tools for law enforcement. Students and faculty across many disciplines will have an opportunity to learn new computational methods for handling big data and for examining the spread of ideas online and through social media.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;By integrating theories of social cognition with natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to understand how deeply-held beliefs and identity dynamics coalesce to form extreme perspectives that could result in derogation of out-groups and hate crimes.  It examines the linguistic features that characterize certain forms of social cognition and hate speech, and considers how the spatial distribution of hate speech can be estimated from sparse, biased data.  The research considers whether socially-motivated hate crimes and acts of hate speech can be predicted using unobtrusive measures and information about social networks.

NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Saurabh Bhargava at Carnegie Mellon University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist studying job search behavior. Specifically, the present research explores the psychological factors that influence job search during unemployment. Many people find the experience of searching for work unpleasant and discouraging. The proposed research aims to test these assumptions and to provide new insights on the psychological mechanisms that might hinder the best possible job-search behaviors. These insights can directly inform the types of policies used to improve search behavior and speed up the pace at which job-seekers find suitable employment.<br/><br/>This project aims to contribute to economists' understanding of job search behavior by testing basic assumptions about the optimality of search effort and strategy and the assumed irrelevance of psychological factors such as discouragement. One reason that behavioral insights have been slow to affect labor economics is the difficulty of capturing labor market dynamics realistically in the laboratory. This research will address this gap by leveraging access to real-world data on the online job search behavior of several hundred thousand job seekers, and a field experiment with unemployed job seekers. Collectively, this will provide new evidence on (i) how individuals search, including effort and search wages, (ii) the optimality of such search relative to a benchmark of the standard model, and (iii) the psychological consequences of unemployment and their effect on search. Further, it will test psychologically informed interventions intended to improve job outcomes. Evidence on whether unemployed job seekers search suboptimally for work and, if so, what specific interventions can improve search will have implications for how economic theory should model job search decisions and unemployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Julie,,Demuth,jdemuth@ucar.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,06/01/2019,11/30/2022,399583.00,"This project investigates ways of reducing the devastating effects that hurricane related storm surges can have on the safety and well-being of communities. Reducing and managing risks from storm surge are challenging because of the complex nature of the hazard and the inherent uncertainty in storm surge forecasting. Weather forecasters and emergency managers often use maps and animations (visualizations) to communicate storm surge risks and threats to the public. However, little is known about how these visualizations influence people's understanding and response to risk. This project will contribute to research on visualizations and how well these work for the communication of hazardous weather risks.  By focusing on attachment to place within the context of coastal communities, the investigators will improve understanding of how people interact with information about coastal hazards and what role visualizations play in understanding and decision-making. The investigators will engage with practitioners and stakeholders throughout the project, from the planning stages to dissemination of the research results, ensuring project relevancy and building strong societal benefit for the needs of affected communities. This project will support educational activities through interdisciplinary training of students and faculty at a variety of institutions including from minority serving colleges and universities. The project will contribute to broader efforts to increase public scientific literacy by focusing on the role of visualizations in communicating complex scientific concepts in a relatable and usable manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to fundamental theoretical and methodological advances in geography, geospatial science, cartography, as well as decision, risk and management science and their intersection with communication of hazardous weather risks.  The research will bridge the gap between how spatially explicit storm surge information is being conveyed by scientists and their interpretation and use by members of the public in at-risk coastal communities. The investigators will consider the role of concepts such as space and place in data representation and hypothesize that connecting people to place through theoretically and empirically informed visualizations will enhance at-risk populations' understandings of and responses to storm surge hazard threats.  The project's research questions are: How do residents of coastal communities perceive a sense of place in their everyday lives and when hazardous storm surge threatens? How can sense of place constructs be integrated into visualization of storm surge threats? How do different ways of representing space and place in storm surge visualizations interact with people's understandings of and responses to the hazards? The investigators will use a multi-method interdisciplinary approach that employs an experimental participatory cognitive mapping process, research on and development of innovative storm surge visualizations, iterative focus groups on risk perception and the degree to which attachment to place factors in to decision-making, and an online survey to test the impact of different types of visualizations.  Together this suite of methods will be able to inform how the visualizations, attachment to place, and other factors influence people's understandings of and responses to storm surge hazards.  The research includes stakeholder engagement in coastal areas and experts from several related government agencies. Although the project focuses on coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the methods, technology, and visualization concepts will be relevant to other coastal communities in the U.S. vulnerable to hurricane storm surge. Furthermore, the theories and empirical findings will be relevant to non-coastal communities by understanding how attachment to place within visualizations can be used to improve communication of risk hazards and decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Rosen,,Valchev,valchev@bc.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,08/01/2018,07/31/2022,248698.00,"This award funds research in macroeconomics. The team starts with the observation that many and possibly most economic decisions require time, attention, and careful reasoning. In other words, economic decisions require a specific kind of work called cognitive effort. However, most standard approaches used in macroeconomics assume that people can make their economic decisions instantaneously, with no effort. The research team will develop and analyze a new and tractable model of an entire economy where people, firms, and institutions find that reasoning requires costly cognitive effort. The model allows for the possibility that individuals, businesses, and policymakers may make economic decisions that are not in their long-run best interest simply because determining the best action takes too much time and effort. This is consistent with results from behavioral science. The new model may give us new tools to predict the effects of economic policies, and therefore could contribute to U.S. economic growth as well as advancing fundamental knowledge in economic science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cognitive limitations studied in this project are not about agents imperfectly observing the relevant state variables such as interest rates, prices, and tax rates. Instead, the focus here is on agents imperfectly computing actions such as hours worked and how much to spend and save. The standard approach in macroeconomics focuses on issues created by imperfect observation and assumes a mapping derived under full rationality. The approach taken in this research is consistent with experimental evidence. Formally, the research starts with the assumption that agents observe the objective states but do not know their optimal policy function. They therefore make rational decisions about how to expend costly cognitive resources to learn about the policy function. The team will first develop a tractable static framework of individual behavior. The key emerging property is that as information accumulates about the unknown policy function, the optimal reasoning choice makes agents' effective actions state and history dependent, leading to non-linearity, endogenous persistence, and volatility clustering. The non-linearity generates both inertia to small shocks, and a salience like effect for large shocks. The second project extends the theoretical analysis to a dynamic setting where agents fully anticipate how current reasoning choices impact future utility and choices. The third project sets the mechanism in a representative agent macro model and studies its aggregate implications, where the non-linear features of the micro behavior are likely to re-surface in aggregate outcomes. There the cognitive limitations that affect individual decision rules as well as the preception of general equilibrium effects are jointly analyzed. The fourth project introduces heterogeneity and incomplete markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience. This project will establish new multidisciplinary approaches to tackle such complex problems as climate change adaptation, and train graduate students from the partner institutions and countries in international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vining and his team will examine how prehispanic agriculturalists developed and switched between various productive strategies as the el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) changed in frequency and severity.  The study region, north coastal Peru, hosted a series of civilizations between approximately 2000 BC - 1450 AD, including the Moche, Lambayeque, and Chimu societies.  However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.  The researchers will use this multidisplinary methodological background to improve historic reconstructions of past ENSO variations, record archaeological examples of agricultural technologies in their environmental context, and reconstruct how different strategies were employed as ENSO effected climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Do they view immigrants as labor-market competitors or as potential allies for their primary constituents? Do they tend to support restrictive or more liberal immigration policies? The principal investigators answer these questions in two ways. First, using new and comprehensive data on state immigration laws and legislative behavior from 2005 to 2020, they analyze whether and under what conditions Black legislators oppose or support particular kinds of immigration bills, and compare their stance to that of their white and Latino colleagues. Second, they apply big data statistical methods to over 80,000 immigration-related articles in the Black, Spanish-language, and general-audience press to examine whether the themes and sentiments expressed in Black media coverage differ substantially from those in other outlets. These two kinds of analysis are linked to examine whether policy development and media coverage reinforce each other. They argue that the Black political and media elite does not view immigration as presenting an either/or choice; instead, they combine concerns about inter-group competition with perceptions of common interests across groups. This study advances scholarship by providing extensive new data on Black responses to immigration, by offering new insights into the dynamics of those reponses, and by connecting immigration-related developments in two important institutional sectors. More generally, this research sheds light on how ""race matters"" in American politics as democratic institutions respond to rapid demographic change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses the issue of how does race influences the politics of immigration; specifically the sociopolitical dilemma that Black elites can support restrictive immigration and decrease labor market competition from immigrants, or they can oppose restrictive immigration and strengthen political alliances with Latinos. It investigates the influence of race on immigration politics by looking at two institutional arenas: state legislative policymaking and the media.  For the analyses of Black elite participation in immigration policymaking, the PIs construct a dataset on votes and sponsorship of state immigration legislation between 2005-2020.  With these data, they estimate hierarchical models comparing Black legislative behavior with the legislative behavior of white and Latino representatives. They investigate how the race of the legislator and the racial composition of their constituency influence not only support for immigration policy, but also leadership roles in the initiation of new immigration policy proposals.  For the analyses of whether and how race is related to media discourse on immigration policy, they create a database of immigration articles from 2005-2020 published in the Black press, the general audience press, and the Spanish language press. The comparison of the frames and themes that emerge from these sources is analyzed using big data procedures (topic modeling and sentiment analysis); these data and measures are used to assess the relationship between legislative behavior and media discourse on immigration. This research provides a new theoretical and empirical model to capture the dynamic relationship between race, legislative behavior, and media discourse across space and over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ""black box"". This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vision is severely impaired when the foveola is damaged. Surprisingly little is known about foveal vision, despite its being so disproportionately important for normal functioning. The goal of this project is to understand how humans control visual attention to efficiently process fine spatial details in the foveola. If specific impairments in foveal vision can be traced back to dysfunctional strategies in the exploration of details because of poor control of attention and/or altered eye movements, it suggests new strategies for counteracting these deficits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this research are: (1) To determine the spatial resolution of attention by investigating whether attention can be selectively allocated within the foveola, facilitating processing at the attended location; 2) To characterize the relationship between eye movements and attention shifts at the foveal scale by examining whether microscopic shifts of attention precede the execution of microsaccades in the same way that macroscopic attentional shifts precede normal saccades; and 3) To explore the extent to which oculomotor behavior at the microscopic scale is driven by top-down factors contributing to the creation of a ""foveal saliency map,"" which prioritizes certain foveal locations over others.  To achieve these goals, the investigator will use a state-of-the-art system for gaze-contingent control of stimulus presentation, which enables visual stimuli to be precisely displayed and maintained at desired eccentricities within the foveola."

The effectiveness of policies adding a new protected category will depend on the actions of employees, employers, and enforcement agencies. Employees gain the right to file discrimination claims when they believe they have experienced discrimination, but not all individuals are equally likely to view their workplace grievances as discrimination or to file a formal charge. Individuals must choose to invoke the law, and those choices will both reflect and shape cultural understandings of the law. From the enforcement agency perspective, handling of cases will also reflect understandings of the law, and legal rulings will develop the body of law and influence employer actions. The interactions of employees and enforcement agencies in the enforcement process may result in different understandings of the law being accepted, modified, or rejected as a new body of law develops, which will in turn influence the social impact of law. To achieve the equity goals of civil rights laws, it is important to understand these interactions, including how the workplace context and public policies influence which claims are seen as having merit. This knowledge could lead to more effective enforcement of civil rights law by providing a guide for compliance evaluations, a factual basis for refinements of agency practices and legal guidance, and a tool to educate employers on how to avoid discriminatory practices. The project draws upon confidential data on more than 9,000 charges of employment discrimination filed by employees with local, state, or federal agencies, using both qualitative and quantitative methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes the development of a new protected category in federal civil rights law related to a recent expansion in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) interpretation of sex discrimination to broaden claims related to gender-stereotyping and other sex-based actions. The empirical analysis involves a two-pronged project that is focused on employees and on the handling of charges at the EEOC. First, the researchers will engage in a qualitative analysis of the narratives filed by parties charging employment discrimination, to explore variation across individual characteristics, workplace characteristics, and legal context in the issues alleged by employees. A qualitative analysis of the discrimination charge narratives will also help to identify why the EEOC might initially classify a charge as more or less meritorious as it processes the charge. Second, the researchers will statistically analyze how the EEOC processes discrimination charges and whether workplace characteristics, state-level laws, and the sociopolitical environment affect whether a charge is found to have merit. A quantitative analysis will allow the use of all charges to identify the effect of workplace and policy context on the EEOC's contribution to this new body of law. The project findings could be used to inform the training of attorneys and human resources professionals to better recognize viable claims of discrimination and to adopt efforts to prevent discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By destroying power grids, communication and transportation infrastructure, hospitals, water and sewer systems, and other public and private resources, Hurricanes Irma and Maria left the peoples of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico heavily dependent on external aid. This project explores a set of economic behaviors emerging in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, with the aim of improving scientific understandings of creative resilience, and identifying the principal sources of extreme vulnerability. Findings will be disseminated to organizations that explore and manage the causes, consequences, and complexities of disaster management and recovery. Funding this research also trains researchers from underrepresented groups in social science research. Findings from this have the potential to establish patterns for how people develop new economic organizational principles in the wake of catastrophe that are more sustainable than the current methods of continued debt and debt service that has plagued Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award supports the collection of critical but ephemeral data in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A team of researchers led by Dr. David Griffith of East Carolina University will explore the relationship between local moral economics, vulnerability, and resilience in post-disaster recovery zones. Observational, transect walk, and comparative photographic methods will take place across five impacted communities, and a stratified (by socio-economic, educational, and other variables) sample of individuals will be interviewed, with the objective of documenting variations and similarities in labor arrangements, common facility, land, and resource use, distribution patterns, and marketing and exchange locales. how perceptions vary, how they develop over time, and how they affect the eventual mitigation and prevention plans that are produced. The research will produce a baseline for future research on vulnerability and resilience in the wake of anthropogenic disasters. Research has established that moral economies tend to emerge in response to recession, depression, austerity programs, and economies disrupted from war, environmental degradation, and natural disaster. Such systems are often critical for long-term resilience. Research conducted on the social and natural sources of vulnerability following Hurricane Mitch, for example, established that vulnerability could be linked to a social system that had encouraged deforestation and other environmentally degrading economic practices. The project will enable us to understand what variance there is with respect to the efficacy of these economic behaviors in mitigating vulnerability and improving resilience."

In 1971, the United States ceased this policy of gold-dollar convertibility, leaving the international economy governed by flexible exchange rates shortly thereafter. This project examines the process of international negotiation over monetary reform that culminated in unilateral American action in 1971, an outcome that defies existing understandings of how institutions change from within. The project also evaluates whether the end of Bretton Woods was driven more by international political interests than the imperatives of the international monetary system itself.

Using declassified documents from the National Archives in College Park, as well as several Presidential Libraries, the project will produce an updated historical narrative of the end of Bretton Woods. There are three objectives: 1) to extend the most current theories of institutional change to address the dynamics of policymaking processes; 2) to articulate a mechanism by which economic policy decisions capitalize on public perceptions of crisis; and 3) to contribute an update social science history of the end of Bretton Woods.

For many years, scholars have studied how people interact with their environment when faced with ecological pressures. Like modern people, prehistoric hunter-gatherers are known to have adapted their subsistence, technological, and social behaviors in response to changes in their local environments. These adaptations influenced, among other things, what they ate, where they lived, what kinds of tools they made, and also how they interacted with each other. The archaeological sciences are ideally suited to studying the relationship between people and their environment over long timespans - spanning centuries to tens of thousands of years - because these kinds of behavioral changes can be detected in the multivariate archaeological record. Coastal zones are dynamic and rich environments with abundant, diverse, and predictable foods and other resources. Scholars have been intrigued by the way coastal environments may have supported and even protected humans living in these places from larger ecological changes that detrimentally affected human groups living in inland locations. Yet considerable gaps remain in these records due to changes in sea levels during glacial phases that shifted the locations of many coastlines by tens to hundreds of kilometers. Understanding how hunter-gatherers adapted to coastal zones over long timeframes, and how these groups compared to populations living inland, therefore, provides new insights into the ways that humans used subsistence, social and technological strategies to mediate ecological pressures in dynamic environments. It also gives the scientific community a broader point of reference for understanding human impacts on coastal environments, which can inform 21st century marine and coastal conservation strategies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;South Africa has one of the oldest and richest records of human coastal occupation. This research project focuses on South Africa's East Coast where very narrow continental shelf has limited coastline movements during glacial periods. This prevented large coastline movements and created stable coastal ecosystems. In one these places, known as Pondoland, rare records of coastal occupation and resource use during the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 26,000-19,000 years ago) have already been recovered by the P5 Project. These records provide a unique opportunity to study hunter-gatherers living in stable coastal contexts over long time periods and compare evidence of their behaviors to hunter-gatherer groups living inland. The project synergizes researchers from numerous international universities and disciplines to answer complex questions about the evolution of human behavior in a unique and persistent environment along Pondoland's coastline. Detailed archaeological, zooarchaeological, and paleoenvironmental information from excavations at two coastal archaeological sites will be collected as well as datasets from systematic landscape studies and ethnographic observations of modern plant foods and coastal foraging. The research will generate new evidence to test questions about coastal ecological variability across glacial and interglacial periods and how these changes impacted hunter-gatherer food-choice patterns, social networks, settlement patterns, and technology. Situating these data within the broader southern African paleolandscape will bring renewed focus on hunter-gatherer's use of coastal and inland resources across glacial and interglacial cycles and it will provide a more nuanced understanding of human evolution and social complexity across broad bio-geographical contexts. The project's interdisciplinary datasets, therefore, will provide detailed insights into past human behavior, humans' long-term impacts on coastal ecology, local environmental changes that influenced various biotic communities, and new methods to conserve these resources for future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our brains construct incredibly rich perceptual experiences from the rawest of visual inputs: patterns of light on the eye's retina. A major challenge is that the environment presents more information than our visual system can fully process at a time, so we rely on the mechanisms of attention to prioritize the most relevant information. Attention and perception are vital cognitive processes that affect every aspect of our daily functioning. Understanding how these processes typically work - and when we are susceptible to perceptual errors and distortions - has critical repercussions for both the healthy visual system and various disorders, along with broad-reaching applications ranging from maximizing human behavior to development of artificial intelligence and technology. The project's education component will increase STEM opportunities for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, enhance undergraduate education, and offer community outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal outlines a three-year integrated research and education plan addressing how visual feature perception is altered during dynamic spatial attention and distraction. The proposal investigates a fundamental challenge for our visual systems: How do we successfully integrate information about 'what' an object is with 'where' it is? While the binding process is challenging enough on its own, it becomes particularly crucial during dynamic vision and cognition, where there are often multiple objects or locations of interest in the environment and spatial attention is constantly shifting. Using a paradigm recently developed by PI Golomb, we test the hypothesis that unstable spatial attention can cause errors in feature and object perception. In Aim 1, we focus on how visual feature perception might be altered during conditions of distraction, in collaboration with co-PI Leber, an expert in attentional control and distraction. In Aim 2, we expand in an even more fundamental direction, asking how different types of dynamic spatial attention might impact object integration for multi-feature objects. The experiments include a combination of perceptual feature reports, probabilistic mixture modeling, EEG alpha decoding, eye-tracking, and reward-based manipulations. This innovative and novel approach strives to advance our understanding of how we achieve stable and integrated visual perception, especially under conditions of dynamic attention and distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some researchers suggest that school discipline policies have become increasingly severe, resulting in a growing number of students receiving school suspensions at all grade levels. At the same time, as schools expand special education plans to provide services for children with medically recognized behavior disorders, a growing number of children are receiving diagnoses and treatment for conditions such as ADHD. School disciplinary and special education practices are intended to allow adults to recognize and respond to perceived child misbehavior. As such, experiences with school punishment, special education, and diagnoses or treatment for behavior disorders should be appropriate and improve future behavior. However, there is growing concern that school discipline and special education practices and interventions intended to improve the learning environment for all youth are instead applied unevenly across children from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. NonHispanic White children are more likely to attend schools with robust special education programs and lower rates of school punishment than racial and ethnic minority children. Consequently, racial and ethnic minority children have higher rates of suspension and are less likely to receive quality special education or medical treatment than White children. As evidence continues to demonstrate the harmful effects of early school punishment on academics and behavior, there is a growing push for schools to adopt approaches to perceived misbehavior that consider underlying behavior problems and disorders. Understanding how school discipline, special education, and diagnoses/treatment for behavior problems affect all children, including marginalized and at-risk youth, will help to craft policies that best serve children with behavior problems in the United States.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is disagreement regarding whether school discipline and special education improve or disrupt educational progress. Additionally, few studies consider school punishment and special education or therapy/medication as opposing or collaborative approaches to child social control. This project combines data from a sample of at-risk households in large U.S. cities (Fragile Families Child Wellbeing Study) and district- and school-level data on disciplinary and special education practices (e.g. Civil Rights Data Collection). The project uses two broad statistical approaches to answer multiple questions. First, standard linear and non-linear regression models and matching models (e.g. propensity score weighting) will be used to estimate how school discipline and special education policies and practices affect (1) adult perceptions of child behavior; and (2) child experiences of school suspension and/ diagnoses/treatment. This will be achieved by comparing children attending schools with different suspension and special education enrollment rates. Second, mediation and moderation models, including interaction terms, will be used to examine whether caregiver and/or teacher perceptions of child behavior explain the relationships between school discipline and special education practices, childhood social control experiences, and future behavior problems and academic achievement.

Matthew,,Sitek,msitek@ucsd.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,11/01/2018,10/31/2019,22151.00,"Although rigidly bordered nation-states are ubiquitous in the modern world, both cooperation and conflict frequently drive sociopolitical communities and economic institutions to diffuse across borders. This transnationalism has come to define our fundamentally cosmopolitan, global political economy. In order to better understand the driving forces and sociopolitical dynamics of transnationalism the researchers seek to identify an origin for these processes. Given the inherently complex, densely connected and global scale of today's geopolitical landscape, tracing the deep prehistoric origins of these phenomena must be done using the archaeological record. Prehistoric examples traced through the archaeological record offer ideal long-term case studies for understanding the sociopolitical and environmental mechanisms that first propelled communities across borders. This project pursues multiple lines of archaeological evidence drawn from well-preserved archaeological sites located in southern Peru, which constituted the western frontier of the Tiwanaku civilization (ca. AD 500-1100), one of the earliest state-level societies to develop in South America. Here in the northern reaches of the Atacama Desert, hyper-arid conditions gave rise to one of the best-preserved archaeological deposits in the world, giving this project an unprecedented view into the daily lives of prehistoric populations. How communities living on the frontier of the Tiwanaku state negotiated their roles within local and regional networks will help to better understand processes and potential outcomes of personal as well as community driven agency and negotiation in today's sociopolitical landscape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the ancient Tiwanaku state to investigate the development of early globalized networks from the perspective of colonial encounters. With access to distinct scales and relationships, both spatial and social, archaeology is uniquely suited to examine broad diachronic patterns within complex systems from a variety of perspectives, from state polities and local communities. Communities on the frontiers of states have traditionally been considered disenfranchised and passive. Moving away from this uniform assessment, this project examines an ancient frontier community as embedded within dynamic local and regional social, economic, and symbolic networks generated by the Tiwanaku state in the south-central Andes (Bolivia, southern Peru, northern Chile). Focusing on the site of Cerro San Antonio (Locumba Valley, southern Peru), this project will target the well-preserved remains of three separate Tiwanaku frontier-settlements utilizing some of the newest methods in the archeological toolkit. Methods include low altitude aerial photography and remote sensing for large-scale mapping, and wide-area excavations of households, neighborhoods, and living spaces to investigate the connectivity and complexity of residential group networks. Treating such settlements with this network approach will provide a powerful framework for illustrating both the local source of global processes as well as the global implications of local action. Following in the tradition of complexity and network analysis, this project will demonstrate that the social, economic, and ritual networks engaged in by frontier communities were localized within broader regional, political processes otherwise attributed entirely to the Tiwanaku state. Ultimately, the research will contribute to understanding how diverse community networks can be integrated (or not) under incipient polities, and their role in the generation and maintenance of states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is inspired by postcolonial debates that introduced notions of agency and negotiation in the structuration of colonial experiences. Local processes of colonial negotiations have been overshadowed by the splendor of the American, Asian, and European riches circulating through this region during the expansion of the imperial enterprise. As a result, non-European people still lack historical agency in the archaeological narratives of colonial Panama. Previous archaeological research highlights the disappearance of indigenous ceramic styles from the archaeological record and their replacement by European and creole styles. This evidence is used to affirm the extinction or assimilation of indigenous groups located in the areas the Spaniards occupied. However, in light of postcolonial debates, the previous statement raises questions about the process of technological change and the role of political and economic variables in colonial Panama. Did local communities keep control of some aspects of ceramic production? Did the Spanish appropriate local knowledge and resources in the production of ceramic technologies? The study of technology is a window to understand the impacts of colonization not accessible through documentary sources. This research will supplement and diversify the elite perspective of Spanish history and its narratives to include the participation of local and non-European communities in the construction of colonial Panama. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on a combination of historical, archaeological, and archaeometric research, MS. Navas will study indigenous production and consumption of ceramics under the supervision of Dr. Rodríguez-Alegría, as part of her doctoral dissertation research at the University of Texas. She will focus on the possible continuity, transformation or disruption of ceramic production and consumption after European colonization. The researcher aims to identify raw materials and technologies used in the production of ceramics in the pre-Columbian and colonial periods. Her study will be centered on compositional analyses of pastes, slips, and glazes of ceramic samples collected in previous excavations from three different Spanish colonial settlements: Nata de los Caballeros, Old Panama (Panama Viejo), and the Panama Historic District (Casco Antiguo). The inclusion of samples from these three sites will allow a regional comparative study of technological and compositional changes in ceramics from different production centers over the long term, starting in the Late Ceramic period (700 AD to conquest) to the nineteenth century. The analyses of the samples will be based on neutron activation analysis (NAA), petrographic thin section analysis, and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). These techniques will permit the identification of the constituent raw materials and techniques used in the production of ceramics and patterns of continuity or change in their use during the colonial period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, Native Americans have been and continue to be dramatically underrepresented in the field of archaeology. The Society for American Archaeology recognizes the benefits of Native American and Indigenous participation in archaeology and has, for the past two decades, developed a Native American Scholarship Fund that supports training Native American and Indigenous archaeologists. These scholarships help ensure that indigenous knowledge and voices continue to become a more vibrant part of the fabric of understanding American culture and past human experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lasting impact of these scholarships has already impacted archaeology and the larger historic preservation community. For example, many of the past recipients of the SAA's Native American Scholarships indicate that their award enabled them to pursue careers in archaeology and in several cases inspired them to create similar opportunities for future generations of indigenous archaeologists to follow in their footsteps. Scholarships awarded through this grant support both graduate and undergraduate education and training in archaeology for Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian students and community members and recipients are selected through a competitive, criteria-based process. The funding provided by the National Science Foundation will enable the SAA to continue their legacy of supporting underrepresented communities within the field of archaeology as part of their commitment to the ""Statement on Diversity,"" which makes inclusiveness an institutional and disciplinary goal.

In addition, there is not enough affordable housing to meet demand. The Great Recession exacerbated this problem, tightening an already constrained housing market for renters.  Landlords play a significant role in providing or prohibiting access to housing as cities gentrify and rental housing markets become more challenging. This project studies how landlords operate under these conditions. The project addresses the following research questions: How do landlords make sense of their role in both residential and commercial contexts? In what ways do landlords amplify or counter neighborhood changes associated with gentrification? How do the actions or inactions of landlords affect access to neighborhoods for various social groups? Understanding how landlords make sense of and react to neighborhood changes associated with gentrification, and the impact of this on including or excluding various demographic groups, will allow for increased understanding of the factors that shape racial and economic residential segregation in the United States. Project findings will have implications for housing policies in the United States.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on gentrification theorizes that landlords are part of the gentrification process, but few studies have provided empirical evidence to analyze these claims. The focus of most gentrification research has been on the experiences of residents (both new and long-time residents)while analyses of landlords in gentrifying neighborhoods have been sparse. This project will address this gap by analyzing how both residential and commercial landlords understand their roles in the context of neighborhood changes associated with gentrification.  The primary data for this project will come from 50 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with landlords and property managers in four gentrifying neighborhoods in a large northeastern U.S. city. The project will include property managers because they occupy a unique position as intermediaries between landlords and tenants in the rental housing relationship. In addition, in order to better understand the day-to-day activities of rental property maintenance and upkeep, the project incorporates ethnographic fieldwork as a means of triangulating the interview data. The ethnographic component of the research project involves performing the duties of a maintenance technician for a large rental real estate company. This project will contribute to scholarship by addressing the gap in research on landlords, analyzing whether landlords act as gatekeepers in both residential and commercial real estate transactions, and by utilizing a strategy of participant observation with landlords, allowing for firsthand observation of their investment, maintenance, and rental agreement practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Findings from this project will advance knowledge about the ways in which cranial growth determines overall skull shape, which is important for understanding primate adaptations and life history through time. The project will support research infrastructure and training of young scientists, and may inform clinical research and treatments for children with cranial malformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study relates differences in cranial base structure (including degree of basicranial flexion and facial orientation) to direct evidence of growth processes. Nine primate species are studied using a novel combination of micro-computed tomography and histological procedures to create 3D virtual reconstructions of the developing skull.  Growth patterns in cranial base synchondroses are quantified using linear and cross-sectional area measurements of cartilaginous zones.  Cranial shape in perinatal and older subadults is described using volumetric, angular, and landmark-based morphometric data.  A combination of descriptive and inferential statistics are applied to address four specific aims: 1) describe the structure of the perinatal cranial base in a comparative sample of primates; 2) document evidence of cellular and tissue-level mechanisms contributing to growth; 3) test for a phylogenetic effect in perinatal cranial base structure; and 4) test the association of cranial base growth patterns with cranial base angle and facial orientation in the perinatal period and in the adult. This project is the first to assess early postnatal synchondroseal patency or fusion in a broad range of primates and advance understanding of growth characteristics of bone and cartilage by directly observing indicators of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, two drivers of interstitial growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the first question, a husband may simply be looking for his wife, whereas with the second, a doctor is needed for an emergency. The only difference between these two questions is ""the"" (the definite article) and ""a"" (the indefinite article). Many languages, however, do not have overt definite and indefinite articles. How, then, do speakers of these languages differentiate between these two meanings? One way to differentiate is by context: ""Is doctor on board?"" in languages without overt articles can be either definite or indefinite, and in context speakers understand whether a particular doctor is needed or any doctor. Certain linguistic theories predict that if a language has an overt definite article, then certain grammatical constructions are prohibited. One such prohibited construction is where modifiers appear disconnected from the noun they modify (""Friendly I saw the doctor"" is not grammatical in English, but possibly grammatical in languages without definite articles). This project will investigate variation in two dialects of an underdocumented language, each of which have different ways of expressing definiteness. These dialects, while mutually understandable, also differ with respect to possible grammatical constructions, like the disconnected modifier construction. This project will advance our understanding of crosslinguistic variation in how languages express definiteness and keep track of individuals in discourse, research with implications for the fields of natural language processing, speech recognition and other branches of computational linguistics. Broader impacts include a public repository of recordings and transcriptions, materials for use by community members, promotion of linguistic sustainability in the region and collaboration with local university students as active contributors to knowledge on their heritage language. Other outcomes include the training of a doctoral student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoPI, a doctoral candidate at Cornell University, will document and analyze two dialects of Ch'ol (CTU), an endangered Mayan language of southern Mexico, for her doctoral dissertation. As the two dialects of Ch'ol (Tila and Tumbala) have different ways to express definiteness, the CoPI will connect this research to theories that predict that certain grammatical constructions are prohibited if a language has a definite article. The Tumbala dialect allows for a variety of modifiers to be disconnected from the nouns they modify. The Tila dialect, however, does not allow many modifiers to appear far away to the noun they modify. The hypothesis of this project is that the Tila dialect has more restrictions than the Tumbala dialect because the Tila dialect has a grammaticalized definite article, whereas the Tumbala dialect does not. During fieldwork, the CoPI will record and transcribe narratives, and conduct interviews with speakers. These varied sources of data will create an empirically sound foundation for the dissertation and future work. The outcomes of this project include in-depth documentation of definite articles and nominal constructions in Ch'ol as well as dialectal variation with respect to definiteness and disconnected nominal expressions, both novel contributions to the field. It will also advance linguistic models at the interface of syntax and semantics and inform work on the marking of definiteness crosslinguistically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry, or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two year of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctroal Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Posdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions tat advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Arlene Rosen and the University of Texas-Austin, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist conducting a geoarchaeological investigation of the multi-scalar impacts of farming systems on the landscapes of northern New Mexico upon the introduction of those systems as part of the Spanish colonial project of the 16th-19th centuries CE. The late pre-colonial and colonial Southwest was marked by a series of dramatic multi-decadal drought episodes that profoundly affected outcomes. The ""Columbian Exchange"" of technologies, plants, animals, and diseases from Spanish colonists to the North American Southwest has had profound impact on the history of the region. However, very little research has been conducted to produce empirical data documenting the geomorphological changes to the land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project identifies and tests three models for landscape change in the Southwest under Spanish colonization. It will produce the first direct analysis of geoarchaeological and microbotanical data from sediments systematically sampled from geological sections adjacent to and downstream from known agricultural areas of two colonial settlements and one Pueblo settlement under colonial influence in the Rio Grande River Valley region of northern New Mexico: Dixon, Cuyumunge, and Picuris Pueblo, respectively. Sediment sections such as these preserve evidence for landscape processes over time, such as sediment transportation (erosional patterns), salinization of sediments (indicating irrigation regimes, land stability, and therefore human mobility patterns), water table levels (indicative of erosive land use practice or damming), and organic content (to assess what kinds of environments were present, including aridification episodes). Studying these sections will allow the researcher of this project to assess how land processes changed in relation to the other changes introduced over the course of colonization in northern New Mexico, and to assess how people responded to their changing landscape. It is particularly notable that this project is in cooperation with two projects in the region that are being hosted by local descendent communities for the first time - the participation of these descendent communities will enhance the accessibility to sampling areas, the contextual knowledge of the data and history, and the broader contribution to community heritage interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the research conducts a series of experiments in the field and longitudinal surveys to understand how labor market outcomes change when jobseekers and firms have better information about jobseekers' skills and potential productivity. The experimental interventions involve measuring jobseekers' skills using standardized assessments and publicizing the results of these assessments in different ways to employers and jobseekers alike.  Varying the information provided allows the researchers to assess the effects of information flows on labor market outcomes. By providing information to both jobseekers and employers, this research is one of the first to study both the supply and demand side effects information flows on job matches.  The results of the research project therefore provide important inputs into the formulation of labor market policies that helps both employers and jobseekers alike.  The results of this research will therefore improve the efficiency of labor markets, increase employment and therefore spur economic growth.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses model-guided randomized experiments with firms and jobseekers to quantify the effect of better information about jobseekers' skills on labor market outcomes. The starting point is a model of job search and job posting where jobseekers have heterogenous skills and both jobseekers and firms observe these skills with error. Limited information on either side of the market can distort both jobseekers' and firms' decisions over job search, job posting, offers, and acceptances. These distortions can reduce total employment, earnings, and productivity. The experiments test this model by randomizing the information firms and jobseekers observe about jobseekers' skills in multiple dimensions (e.g. numeracy, fluid intelligence, grit). Supply-side surveys measure jobseekers' beliefs, job search, employment, and earnings. Demand-side surveys measure firms' beliefs, hiring, wage bills, productivity, and profits.  Unlike existing research on information frictions in the labor market, this project studies both the supply and demand sides of the market, embeds the experiments in a model of supply and demand, and attempts to separate employment creation from employment displacement effects.  The results of this research will provide guidance on policies to improve efficiency of the labor market, increase employment, and economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include, but are not limited to, the analysis of causal effects of economic policies; features of the distribution of counterfactual outcomes (e.g. optimal reserve prices and optimal revenues) under weak assumptions; counterfactual vote shares and seats assignments; welfare effects of policy interventions; demand extrapolation and welfare analysis subject to rationality constraints; maximum and minimum responses to monetary policies. This research aims at establishing a general, formal framework and providing a methodology for estimation and robust inference on optimal values of nonlinear programs under weak restrictions on the underlying process that has generated the observable data. Recognizing that the computational feasibility of the method is crucial for its applicability and usefulness for empirical researchers and society more broadly, the investigators deliver algorithms for computation of the proposed estimators and robust confidence intervals. This research also delivers a collection of portable computer programs implementing the methodology that will be shared with the community openly and free of charges or restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims at developing robust inference procedures and computational methods for parameters in econometric models that are characterized as optimal values of nonlinear programs. Making inference on such functionals is nontrivial because subtle features of the underlying optimization problem may affect inference. For example, the optimal solution may not be unique, may be unique but only weakly identified, or may be characterized by intricate constraints. Due to these challenging features, existing methods often impose assumptions such as constraint qualifications on the underlying optimization problem. These are hard to verify in practice. This research aims at developing inference methods that place very little structure on the optimization problem. Further, the project aims at developing and investigating the convergence properties of a computational method that can be used to implement the procedure. Nonlinear programs often involve black-box functions that are computed by simulation or by solving a complex structural model. The algorithm developed in this project, which is based on the response surface method, mitigates the computational cost by constructing flexible approximations to such functions and adaptively drawing evaluation points to regions that are highly relevant for finding the optimal value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The changes include changes in the vesting of pension benefits and changes in unemployment compensation. Real wage growth for the median worker in the United States has stalled in recent decades despite positive growth in productivity. The research will help us understand how labor markets determine wages, considering a variety of forces including bargaining power, unemployment insurance, and competition between employers. Through a better understanding of these forces, the project will provide insight into whether specific policies will lead to higher wage growth for American workers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will advance our knowledge of wage determination using quasi-experimental approaches that illuminate the role of outside options.

As a result of migration in this period, Puerto Ricans are currently the largest Hispanic population in cities of the Eastern seaboard and overall the second largest Hispanic group in the US. Although Puerto Ricans have been US citizens since 1917, they share many cultural and economic characteristics with the rest of Latin America. Thus, a better understanding of this historical period provides a window into migrant networks and future trends in migration from Latin America, the largest source of immigrants in the postwar era. The investigator uses data from employment applications submitted between 1948 and 1991 to a Puerto Rican public employment agency in the mainland US to better understand the skill level of those who chose to migrate, measure changes in the economic status of migrants, and analyze migrants' process of English acquisition and educational attainment after arrival.

The analysis is divided into three sections. First, information on migrants' origin, arrival, and destination allows for assessment of the relationship between network size and migrant self-selection as networks evolve over time. Second, the short-run return to migration is measured by comparing the first wage of a migrant in the US to his/her last wage in Puerto Rico, while subsequent wages are used to assess convergence to natives and identify determinants of wage growth in the US. Third, the ostensible slow assimilation of Puerto Rican migrants is reexamined using new information on English acquisition and educational attainment after arrival in the US and by exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the data, which reduces the bias introduced by selective return migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This objective was officially and repeatedly linked to the unique demands of contemporary warfare, generally, and the Middle Eastern operational environment, specifically. New doctrine was written. Old strategies were recast and revised. New cultural and language training programs, the emphasis on culture in field and technical manuals, the expansion of military cultural research centers, and a massive increase in human intelligence, special operations, and other military fields deemed to be cultural subject matter experts all helped realize this vision organizationally. A highly-public discourse made it clear that cultural awareness would be key to contemporary soldiering. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, explores the role of culture in the operational and institutional objections of the military. In addition, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings outside academe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bethany Kibler, under the supervision of Dr. Steven Caton of Harvard University will explore the production and circulation of knowledge around the concept of culture within the operational and institutional objectives of the military. Since 2003, the emphasis on culture and cultural awareness has shaped the lives and experiences of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers. In contrast to other social scientific work on the so-called cultural turn, which has tended to document how the discourse around cultural awareness may have served to reframe the war in less objectionable terms to the American public, this research examines this discourse in a more open-ended and empirically grounded way. The researcher investigates the training sites, team rooms, and patrol routes where culture and cultural awareness are learned and put into practice by soldiers themselves. Over 18 months and across three communities of military cultural subject matter experts I will ask: What notion of culture is mobilized when culture becomes a military tool? What alternative knowledges and/or epistemologies about war, culture, and cultural competence are produced as soldiers operationalize this high-level and ever-changing vision? Most importantly, what can a study of cultural awareness tell us about how soldiers navigate and shape military institutional structures? In pursuing this line of questioning, this research tests the anthropological premise that institutions of all kinds are shaped by the human agents that represent and embody them, often in ways that high-level leadership or policy-makers fail to recognize or anticipate. Indeed, as the nascent ethnographic literature on the military shows, soldiers are often savvy consumers and invested actors who negotiate, resist, and recast aspects of the military's norms and messaging. By looking at the military production of cultural knowledge from the ground up, the competing epistemological commitments soldiers bring to bear and generate in confronting that knowledge, and the ethics of soldiering through cultural difference (cast as both morally and physically dangerous by trainers and soldiers alike), the research aims to contribute to current conversations in Middle Eastern studies, military studies, and the anthropology of ethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ideal of rational government administration has been historically variable. Before 1870, the national government was largely undeveloped and local governments were in the pockets of political machines. Over the next century, calls for moral rectitude and bureaucratic integrity gave way to calls for effectiveness and efficiency, which eventually led to a regime of optimization and the adoption of cost-benefit analysis as the core of administrative decision-making.  This project investigates this history and tests its argument on two case studies.

This area of economics focuses on understanding how incentives affect economic outcomes, with the goal of designing effective and efficient payment and reward plans. The project aims to expand mechanism design theory by providing a new tool to study the problems caused when long-term commitment to a contract is unrealistic. For example, online retailers, insurance companies, and banks interact with their customers over time. As these firms learn about their customers, they may want to change contract terms by making personalized offers to some customers. In the same way, governments may sign agreements about sovereign debt, but bailouts and renegotiation may change the terms of the original agreement. The new method has promise for new applications of this important area of economic theory, including a range of applications from debt and mortgage contracts, monetary policy, the design of online platforms, online privacy, and auctions for advertising sales. As a result, the research could result in more effective management methods for businesses and government policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress on optimal mechanism design under limited commitment has been hindered by a lack of a tractable methodology. The team will develop a new methodology based on the idea that a mechanism should encode not only the rules to determine the allocation, but also the information the designer obtains from the interaction. This means that how much the designer learns becomes an explicit part of the design. The project has three key parts. First, the team will develop this new tool, which will be akin to the use of the revelation principle in classical mechanism design. Second, the team will use the method to characterize optimal trading mechanisms in infinite horizon settings. The characterization provides a solid foundation to Coase?s conjecture and the solution method can serve as a prototype to characterize optimal fiscal policy or social insurance when governments have limited commitment ability in infinite horizon settings. Third, the team will examine the optimal design of information collection policies (for example, the use of cookies) and the resulting issues of transparency and privacy that arise when firms collect information about consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reid, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago, along with colleagues in Peru, will investigate the role of road infrastructure in the political economy of expansionary states and its impact on borderland communities. This project focuses on the relationship between imperial expansion and consolidation and the networks of long-distance communication, travel, and commerce, of which road and waystation infrastructure were the direct conduits. As mobility routes are consistently reused over time, the discipline of archaeology is well positioned to understand how changes in infrastructure relate to broader socio-economic and political shifts on long time-scales. In what ways do expansionary states rely on local knowledge to coopt and develop networks of infrastructure? How does greater economic connectivity between a state center and borderland societies contribute to changes in ideology and social identity? As modern networks of travel and communication become increasingly accelerated and connected, the researchers will investigate the deep roots of interregional connectivity and the role of infrastructure in the processes of state-building. This project contributes to the professional training of undergraduate and graduate students from both the United States and Peru. Results of this research will be shared through articles published in both Spanish and English, conference papers, and through community outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reid and his research team will examine how roads, including sites that served as rest stops and places of exchange, were implemented by both outside state agents and local communities. This research will be conducted in the Majes Valley of Arequipa, a key corridor of travel between the Andean highlands and Peru's southern coastal valleys. This region was an important borderland of Peru's first empire: the Wari whose material culture and customs spread across much of Peru during the Middle Horizon (ca. AD 600-1000). The researchers will analyze archaeological materials recovered from excavations of four caravan waystation sites that indicate both a local and Wari foundation for this road network. A diverse set of materials and methods will be employed, including material provenance analyses to understand the movement of trade goods such as ceramics and obsidian, botanical analysis to reconstruct past foodways, and C14 dating to understand the chronology and development of the waystation system. The presence of ritual spaces, including a Wari temple, at the road waystation sites also inform us on the role of religion and ritual in processes of state expansion. Consequently, this project examines how road infrastructure and associated sites facilitate processes of economic exchange, ritual practice, and socio-political integration of local communities into projects of the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Endogenous migration is critical to understanding important social phenomena ranging from recruitment into and turnover in organizations to the mass convergence of volunteer responders that occurs when disaster strikes. Endogenous migration is an important driver of the heterogeneity that can challenge conventional models of social network structure.  This project will address current limitations in the modeling of networks with endogenous migration. The development of these models will advance modeling of complex social systems. Although the primary impact of this research will be within the statistical and social science communities, the tools and techniques to be developed also will be applicable to problems in biology, computer science, and engineering. The resulting insights will have direct policy relevance for groups or organizations dealing with important societal issues, such as emergency responses. The project also will make contributions via student education and training, the creation of instructional materials, and freely available software tools for use by government, industry, researchers, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new families of statistical models for studying social networks with endogenous migration processes.  The project will build on the well-known exponential family random graph model and related network modeling frameworks to integrate migration processes.  The investigator will develop of new classes of models for dynamic relational data with endogenous migration and for cross-sectional data arising from unobserved migration-dependent processes. The investigator will evaluate and test these new model classes using social network data. A variety of data sets will be used as testbeds for the new models, including social media data, disaster-related data, and water and polymer data. Testbed applications will be used to evaluate the models and also facilitate the communication of results across disciplines.

In each city studied, project researchers will examine the operation and use of science in four arenas of governance: environment, health, transportation and education. They will explore how these different arenas interrelate, and they will map the sources of scientific evidence used in governance, how these sources are evaluated, and translated into policy and programming. They will also document and analyze the scientific infrastructures that produced the findings used in governance, the diversity of stakeholders involved in interpreting scientific findings, and diverse cultural logics that shape the creation and use of scientific knowledge in different settings. Ethnographic interviews will be the primary means of data collection, supplemented by analyses of scientific publications, policy debates, and media coverage. The final stage of the project will result in recommendations that will be actively disseminated among policy makers, journalists and other stakeholders in all cities and countries studied in the project.

The aim of the project is to advance understanding of different ways scientific capacity is developed and used in governance, examining how environmental health research and governance has developed. The project will result in a theoretically robust, empirically grounded conception of environmental health research and governance styles, detailing and categorizing different ways of developing environmental health data, advancing the sciences of environment and health, and directing these toward governance of complex problems. It will extend theorization of governance by addressing how scientific cultures, practices, and infrastructure shape governance processes and outcomes; and it will test and stabilize the process and cyberinfrastructure needed to support collaborative research in the social studies of science. Project results will have wide implications in efforts to improve collaboration between governance regimes (across scale, and between nations); such collaboration is particularly important in addressing complex, often trans-boundary problems like air pollution, which call for new levels of cooperation and sharing of technology, data, and effective policy design."

The analysis will use satellite images and an archive of recently recovered air-photos from historical expeditions.  Findings from the study will contribute to the limited knowledge of alpine glacier histories in remote regions, with implications for future estimates of ice loss and global sea-level change. The research will capitalize on a unique collection of historical air-photos, which have been underutilized as a source of data, thereby providing an opportunity to assess alpine glacier change on a regional scale.  This study will foster a new international collaboration with the Natural History Museum of Denmark and engage undergraduate students in polar geospatial research.  The doctoral student and her advisor will develop workshops for K-12 STEM teachers from the Chicago public-school district.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most previous studies of remote glaciers have been restricted to the satellite era of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Thus, the long-term, Holocene, history of these glaciers and ice caps is generally not well known, despite their importance to global sea level. Of particular relevance to the future, their sensitivity to sustained periods of past warming is poorly understood. To facilitate improved estimates of past glacier activity as well as future glacier change, the doctoral student will utilize historical air-photos, Landsat and Worldview satellite data, as well as several open-sourced digital analytical tools to reconstruct historical glacier extent and area, and model glacier Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA).  In combination with the related research which reconstructs long-term Holocene glacier histories using lake sediments in the same region, this complementary geospatial analysis will place 20th and 21th century glacier variability into a longer-term perspective. Although this research project will focus on alpine glaciers in South Greenland, it is highly relevant to understanding the impacts of global environmental change more broadly.

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. The Bioarchaeology of Bronze Age Social Systems REU program supports a diverse pool of nationally recruited undergraduates engaged in the entire research process from hypothesis formation to data collection, analysis, public outreach, and publication. Teams of students collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of dynamic scientists and professionals while conducting original research on two Bronze Age skeletal collections, examining how alternative pathways to social complexity during an increasingly globalized Bronze Age were embodied in the human skeleton and reflected in mortuary practices. Many of these bioarchaeological methods have applications to forensic anthropology as well, and by illustrating their utility and accuracy, students may contribute to advancing the use of more accurate demographic techniques in contemporary criminal cases involving commingled remains. Students also receive training on how to effectively disseminate their research results to both academics and the broader public all while engaging in discussions surrounding the ethics of working with human remains. Participants similarly receive mentorship in professional development via guest scientists and with established summer undergraduate research workshops at the University of South Alabama. Prior to conference presentations, students engage with members of the local community to share their project findings using weekly blogs, social media posts, posters, and digital stories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on two large skeletal collections dating to 2700-2000 BCE.

This project focuses on hot flashes as an aspect of human variation during reproductive aging, and tests the hypothesis that brown adipose tissue - a type of fat that generates heat - may be a factor associated with hot flash experience. The study will extend our knowledge about human variation in both brown adipose tissue and hot flash experience, with particular attention to the relation between hot flashes (subjectively reported and biometrically measured), brown adipose tissue, body composition, and climate.  The study will address human variation in the ability to generate and dissipate heat, and findings will contribute to knowledge about modern human biological adaptations. The outcomes of this research may also inform clinical understanding and treatments of conditions that affect many women in the U.S., including hot flashes and obesity. Results from this study will be shared with participants and communities through public talks, brochures and a project website.  Undergraduate women will assist with the research, thereby gaining valuable experience in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When brown adipose tissue is activated by cool or cold conditions, it creates heat in an effort to keep the body warm.  The central hypothesis of this study is that brown adipose tissue activation may produce enough heat to cause hot flashes.  The  aim is to explore the role of brown adipose tissue activation in the experience of hot flashes among peri-menopausal and early postmenopausal women, aged 45-55, during the cold months -- from late October to early April -- in western Massachusetts.  The investigators hypothesize that (1) women with more brown adipose tissue activity will be more likely to objectively demonstrate and subjectively report hot flashes, (2) brown adipose tissue activity is more likely to be associated with hot flashes in heavier women, and (3) acclimatization to heat and (4) exposure to lower ambient temperatures amplify the association between brown adipose tissue activity and hot flashes.  The study involves face-to-face interviews about hot flashes and factors associated with hot flashes, physical activity, and stress; body measurements (height, weight, skinfolds, waist and hip circumferences); body composition by bioelectrical impedance; an estimation of brown adipose tissue activity with an infrared camera before and after dipping a hand into cool (64oF) water for five minutes; an ambulatory hot flash monitor worn for 24 hours to record both objective and subjective hot flashes; and an Actigraph GT9X watch to measure activity and sleep patterns for the same 24 hours.

Reading is a pervasive part of modern human life, and impaired reading is highly detrimental to scholastic and professional success. Despite its importance, the neural processes that enable skilled readers to comprehend multi-word combinations remain poorly understood. In this research, Dr. Albert Kim and Dr. Phillip Gilley of the University of Colorado Boulder will use cutting edge neurophysiological methods to understand how the brain generates and uses predictions about the upcoming words within a text during reading, guided by prior linguistic context. Predictions are thought to support the fast pace of normal reading, which is typically 3-5 words per second, by allowing the brain to prepare in advance for anticipated text before it arrives in the retinal input. Predictions are also thought to be crucial to the common ability to perceive words accurately in the face of impoverished inputs, such as conditions of poor lighting, print quality, or visual acuity. The research in this project is expected to produce knowledge that guides the identification of reading disorders and distinctions between different sorts of disorders, which can in turn guide clinical and pedagogical approaches to reading disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use scalp-recorded encephalography (EEG) to observe neural oscillatory activity -- reflecting the dynamic coupling and uncoupling of neural networks -- while healthy young adults read sentences. The sentences that participants read will be manipulated so that some sentence contexts render a specific word likely to occur, according to computational language models.  Under these conditions, brain activity that occurs before and after the appearance of a word in the linguistic input will be examined for evidence of predictions. The project will investigate the role of neural oscillations in conveying predictions about upcoming words from high level brain regions to low level visual cortical areas and also in assessing the match between predictions and the bottom-up sensory input. The researchers will also study the types of linguistic contexts and processing demands that engage such predictive activity. Results of this research are expected to contribute significantly to cognitive neuroscience by combining three critical areas of research that have typically been studied separately: language processing, prediction in cognition, and neural oscillations. The project will develop new analytic methods for characterizing neural oscillations in EEG data, which will be developed into a toolbox to be shared with other researchers.

This striking appearance results from miniaturized body hair and increased sweat gland density (approximately 10 times higher than that of a chimpanzee). These adaptations allow humans to cool their body temperature through increased air flow over the skin and evaporation of water from the skin surface.  This project will find and explain the genomic changes underlying the human-specific evolutionary modifications to hair and sweat gland composition.  The biological insights, as well as the data, methods and tools developed as part of this research program, will provide novel assets to transform the investigation of the genetic bases of other adaptive skin traits and skin physiology more generally.  The data generated by this project also will advance ongoing efforts to build and properly pattern hair and eccrine glands in vitro, a major obstacle in comprehensive human skin regeneration.  In addition, this project will support the training of under-represented minority students and researchers, and fund the development of a public, educational website on human skin evolution, which will highlight outstanding questions in skin evolution and curate ongoing and new discoveries on this topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program builds on the recent discovery by the research team that a subset of biological signals that increase eccrine gland density also alter hair development, leading to diminished hair size.

We focus on the contents of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) prepared by the US Forest Service (USFS) under the National Environmental Policy Act. Providing a more detailed picture of how scientific information is used in government decision-making will enable government agencies to improve the processes through which they incorporate scientific information. At the same time, providing details of what types of scientific information are utilized in public decision-making processes will help scientists, universities, and funding agencies prioritize science that is policy-relevant. To forward these goals, the project will publish an index that will assist scientists in comparing the policy impact of different publications and will conduct outreach activities with environmental planners to help them understand the implications of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use web scraping and computational text analysis to collect and analyze the use of science in all USFS EISs produced between 2006 and 2018.

It is hypothesized that in-group preferences might become stronger during times of heightened stress. The study tests this by examining the consequences of acute stress induced by the provision of hydrocortisone pills to experiment participants. For a randomly chosen treatment group, the researchers directly increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol by pharmacologically administering its physiological precursor, hydrocortisone. A randomly chosen control group receives an identical-looking placebo pill. Participants in both conditions then undertake standard behavioral games that test whether there is greater trust, trustworthiness, altruism, or generosity towards coethnics. By comparing the behaviors of those in the stress condition versus those in the control condition the research team can assess whether stronger coethnic preferences arise during episodes of heightened stress. The structure of the experiment also allows the research team to test whether acute stress affects other forms of in-group preferences such as own-age or own-gender preference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Irrigation megaprojects in arid landscapes feature prominently in agricultural development worldwide. Planning and policy entities often focus on the economic benefits of irrigation water for farmers. However, irrigated soils are often central to ecological and social conflicts that follow the construction of irrigation districts. Such conflicts include reduced soil quality, water contamination via agricultural runoff, and displacement of regional farmers by investors' large land acquisitions. Therefore, this research will investigate the social and ecological effects of irrigation megaprojects and the related governing policies and practices of irrigation water and soils. This research will contribute to scholarly and policy considerations of social-environmental feedbacks in governance. The broader impacts of this project will (1) work toward improved irrigation infrastructure development, (2) strengthen management of irrigated land to ensure increased sustainability of soil and water resources, and (3) encourage policy that ensures more equitable access to irrigated land. During this research diverse university students will receive training in mixed methods research. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This dissertation investigates the interactions and feedbacks between irrigation megaprojects, soil management practices, and soil and water governance. Scholarship of environmental governance related to irrigation has focused on issues of water access and control.

The coupling of and tensions between water and soil use and governance require detailed empirical examination that leverages key literatures within geography and the spatial sciences, particularly environmental governance, coupled human-environment systems, and feminist political ecology. Three questions guide this research: (1) How does access to water from irrigation megaprojects shape soil management practices, specifically crop selection, crop rotations, and applications of agrochemicals? (2) How do social and environmental stressors inform soil management practices? (3) How do social and environmental stressors feedback into environmental governance? This research employs a mixed methods approach including change detection analysis, environmental archival research, participant observation, a survey, farm transect walks, and semi-structured interviews with farmers, irrigation managers, and government officials.

These historic storms are certain to mark a turning point, not only for the massive damage they have caused to the island's infrastructure, but also for the extended state of emergency that was produced when millions of Puerto Ricans remained without electricity, water, and basic services for numerous weeks. Hurricane Maria has already created the largest black out in US history, it has caused greater infrastructural damage than Katrina, and is poised to completely transform the island of Puerto Rico and its political future. This project takes advantage of this unique state of infrastructural stress to ask how the storm, and its recovery process, will shape civil society behavior in years to come.

For this project researchers from the University of Puerto Rico, under the supervision of the PI, will contact participants from the previously conducted study to interview them about how they have experienced the storm and the recovery process. Investigators will assess how the state of emergency might have jostled pre-existing political beliefs, particularly how it might impact the desire (or not) for statehood. The results of this study will help offer a complex portrait of how the effects of climatic events are conditioned by pre-existing forms of governance and will help illuminate how natural disasters can transform political and social terrains."

Specific aims of the study are to investigate whether ERI mitigates or worsens the association between racial discrimination and development as well as identify mechanisms by which ERI influences development during the transition to adulthood. This project will improve understanding of how ERI operates and the role social context plays in the associations between racial discrimination and development. The project will also address theoretical debates about the presumed positive impact of ERI.  Developmental outcomes during the transition to adulthood will be assessed using questionnaires and physiological stress reactivity tests. Broader impacts are significant, because findings can be used to improve the social and psychological well-being of vulnerable youth. Moreover, findings can potentially support and further evidence-based prevention-intervention efforts aimed at fostering positive youth development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racial discrimination constitutes a significant risk to the healthy development of African American youth during the transition to adulthood. Some evidence suggests that ERI protects against the harmful effects of racial discrimination, but there have been few systematic attempts to disentangle mixed findings. Participants will be African American young adults attending a southeastern, predominantly White institution and a mid-Atlantic historically Black college/university. Students will complete a series of questionnaires assessing key study variables followed by two laboratory challenges, once a year, for three consecutive years. Autonomic reactivity (as indexed by cardiovascular psychophysiology) will be assessed during the laboratory challenges. The central questions of the study are whether the protective or vulnerability function of ERI is influenced by the social context in which the youth are embedded and whether the impact of ERI on biopsychosocial development can be explained by coping skills, self-esteem, and perceptions of racial discrimination. Key hypotheses are: 1) ERI will act as a vulnerability factor in the link between racial discrimination and development in contexts with lower levels of diversity; 2) Initial levels of racial discrimination will lead to changes in ERI, which, in turn, will be associated with changes in development; and 3) Racism appraisals and coping will explain the association between ERI and changes in development during the transition to adulthood. Hypotheses will be tested using latent growth curve modeling. These results will be used to inform recommendations for the development of a contextually-tailored pilot ERI intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this goal it is necessary to have robust analytic tools which permit researchers to move from objects excavated from the ground to conclusions regarding the behaviors of people responsible for their discard. This project is important because it assists in developing such techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tammy Buonasera will begin a series of experiments using replicas of prehistoric ground stone milling tools (manos and metates and mortars and pestles) to generate empirically informed models of ground stone processing efficiency. These models will help evaluate relationships between ground stone technology, mobility, and resource use among prehistoric hunter-gatherers. The significance of the project rests on  its potential to increase  knowledge of economic decisions made by individuals engaged in plant food processing. In many contexts around the world, changes in the form and frequency of ground stone milling tools play key roles in reconstructing sequences of resource intensification, sedentism, and plant domestication. Despite this, there are few empirically grounded comparisons of the relative efficiency of different milling tool-resource combinations in the literature.  Rather, links between form and function typically rest on commonsense notions of efficiency or ""suitability."" This study will provide better estimates than we now have for defining when it would be profitable to shift between grinding technologies, and results will be widely applicable to studies of ground stone function and resource use in many places and times. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will begin with a series of controlled experiments designed to measure and compare the efficiency of five different forms (three mortar and two metate shapes), and two different raw materials (a harder and a softer stone), for processing four resources with different physical characteristics (acorns, small hard seeds, tule roots, and ocher). Because this research aims to provide data for modeling tool design choices among hunters and gatherers with varying degrees of mobility (i.e., from conditions of high residential mobility, where food is not stored, to semi-sedentary contexts, where food storage may be critical), experiments will also compare grinding efficiency and use-wear patterns for fresh and dried versions of the plant resources (acorns, small hard seeds, tule roots). Simple optimization models will be used to compare experimental estimates of food processing labor and costs of tool manufacture against overall productivity. Ultimately, this research will improve knowledge about relationships between grinding tool designs and economic decisions made by individuals engaged in food processing. It will also contribute to improving interpretations of use-wear patterns on ground stone tools. The project will be completed over a two-year period with the help of community volunteers and university students who will participate in the experimental process.  The project will also produce both a physical and a digital reference set for future use-wear analysis."

Every day in the United States, more than 1.4 million youth caregivers support family members who have a chronic illness, disability, or other health issue that requires help, supervision or support. Youth caregivers often assume responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. They may also support basic activities of daily living such as assisting in mobility, dressing, feeding, and administering medication. Like adult caregivers, youth caregivers encounter a diversity of social, cultural, and geographic or spatial impacts which vary according to the type and intensity of care they provide to a loved one. However, unlike adult caregivers, youth in the United States tend not to be recognized for the care that they provide. Furthermore, there are few public programs that provide support for their distinct needs. As pressure upon family caregivers intensifies in the U.S. with the aging of the population and projected shortages of paid care workers, young people are likely to play a larger role in providing support, comfort, and assistance to family members. Results from this research will be widely disseminated to researchers, social service providers and educational professionals, with implications for youth caregiver health and wellbeing. Additionally, the investigator and a graduate student will work directly with youth caregivers to support the creation of a participatory digital caregiving project, creating opportunities for STEM education related to digital design and production, technology use, and science communication.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to understanding how youth caregiving impacts childhood geographies. The project will focus on three key objectives: 1) to understand the relationship between youth caregiver recognition and identity; 2) to explore how youth caregiving impacts childhood perceptions of time, space, scale, and place; and, 3) to identify ways to better incorporate youth caregiving into future research and policies of family caregiving in the United States. Youth caregivers will participate in oral histories and a ""care mapping"" exercise to analyze the relationship between caregiving identity and childhood geographies. Analysis of project documents, and participatory digital projects with youth caregivers will provide additional information about recognition and caregiver identity. The research will take place with young people who receive support from the Caregiving Youth Project, a nonprofit organization that works with school districts to provide services to youth caregivers in Palm Beach County, Florida. Though the work is limited to one geographic area in the United States, the findings are relevant to understanding the experiences of family caregiving by this largely hidden population.

Societal collapse is a process that brings political entities to an end, prompting economic instability, political fragmentation, and changes in a society's structure. Throughout human history, many societies have been able to reorganize after the challenging times brought about by episodes of collapse. With its long-term perspective on the study of social phenomena, archaeology can advance a broader understanding of the social and economic conditions that are instrumental in the process of revitalization of human settlements. This research project will evaluate four social factors that may contribute to post-collapse settlement regeneration: participation in exchange networks, limited wealth inequality, human migrations, and interactions with ruins. Determining the role that these social factors play in the establishment of post-collapse settlements has important implications for the present and the future. Research results may have a positive impact on the lives of people affected by episodes of societal collapse, such as displaced populations and refugees. Through public talks, academic articles, and an online platform, a wide range of individuals, including social scientists, government officials, and the general public, will have access to the conclusions reached by this research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Rosado-Ramirez and his research team will investigate whether participation in exchange networks, limited wealth inequality, human migrations, and interactions with ruins were instrumental in a case of post-collapse settlement within a ruined city. The research will take place in Ake, an ancient city located in southeastern Mexico. This region was impacted by an episode of societal collapse between 750 and 1100 CE, that resulted in the abandonment of urban centers, the end of a political system based on the institution of divine kingship, and massive depopulation. After that period, people reorganized and established new settlements that thrived for hundreds of years. The research team will conduct systematic excavations in domestic mounds and shrines in Ake. They will analyze artifacts, human and animal remains, and architectural evidence to determine the social and economic conditions that allowed people to revitalize a settlement within a ruined city in the wake of collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Robert Crosnoe at the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating STEM experiences among Mexican-origin students in K-12 education in new and established Latino/a destinations. By focusing on the fast-growing and disadvantaged Mexican-origin student population, this research addresses racial/ethnic inequality in STEM participation. The study will identify aspects of communities and schools that help or hinder positive STEM experiences among Mexican-origin students, which can inform policy interventions to increase participation in STEM fields among this underrepresented group. This research thus seeks to broaden STEM participation in a growing and vulnerable population in U.S. schools while supporting the career development of a scholar dedicated to this goal.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the ways in which K-12 schools in both traditional and emerging Latino/a destinations in the U.S. shape Mexican-origin student experiences in STEM with three primary objectives: 1) To determine whether Mexican-origin students attending schools in new destinations have lower STEM participation and achievement than Mexican-origin students in established communities; 2) To investigate whether systematic differences in school contexts across Latino/a destinations explain such STEM disparities between Mexican-origin students in new versus established destinations, and; 3) To examine whether variability in school contexts within new and established Latino/a destinations moderates links between destinations and STEM participation and achievement among Mexican-origin students. The Postdoctoral Fellow will pursue these goals with quantitative analyses of datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics. This research will draw from and contribute to disciplinary fields including sociology, demography, and education. This work will advance inquiry into STEM outcomes among underrepresented groups and will contribute to debates about immigrant-receiving contexts and incorporation among the Mexican-origin population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will inductively derive the relationships between behaviors prescribed and proscribed in the texts and more measurable dimensions of inequality, such as social class. The project will also uncover the connections between those written norms and the social boundaries and exclusions that create inequality.  The project will inform understanding regarding the pervasiveness of social inequality that has previously been resistant to scientific study and will provide evidence regarding how social norms change over time.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will study social norms through analysis of an original digital corpus consisting of texts describing correct behaviors.

The research uses multiple methods including corpus linguistics analytic techniques of topic modeling, word embedding, word network mapping, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. These strategies will identify social norms, symbolic boundaries, techniques for the enforcement of norm compliance, and narratives of justification attaching moral values to social norms. Machine learning will be guided by and supplement traditional by-hand content analysis of texts from the same corpus. The project will also use archival research to place the research findings in their social and historical contexts.

This project aims determine how specific conditions ultimately contributed to past shifts in technology, trade, and diet to build on previous research documenting the extent of human flexibility and resilience. What factors propel important changes to hunter-gatherer subsistence in particularly marginal environments? An archaeological perspective provides a singular opportunity to track the complex relationship between human behavior and shifting external social or climatic conditions by integrating data that spans centuries, hundreds of square miles, and multiple disciplines. Where previous scholarship has focused on the human-environment relationship at distant periods in prehistory or in large-scale societies, few researchers have investigated the causes of recent, well-documented behavioral changes in hunter-gatherers. Incorporating Athabaskan perspectives and engaging Alaskan high-schoolers, this research aims to isolate the driving factors behind a clear and dramatic behavioral shift and concomitant migratory event in the recent pre-Columbian history of Subarctic North America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan doctoral student Briana Doering will study human-environment relationships by evaluating how hunter-gatherers navigate risk in marginal environments. The work will be conducted in association with researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Colorado State University, and the University of Arizona. Specifically, this collaborative project will evaluate whether a massive volcanic eruption or population growth resulted in wide-scale shifts in Subarctic hunter-gatherer technology, diet, and trade, and an ultimate southward migration. To explain these behavioral changes, the research team will conduct excavations at four archaeological sites in central Alaska in consultation and collaboration with the descendant Athabaskan community, and study the recovered artifacts using standard statistical analyses and novel geochemical techniques. These material results will then be related to extensive archaeological, climatic, and ecological data from previous investigations in Alaska and Canada with a regional geospatial analysis. This comparative perspective combines uniquely fine-grained social and environmental data from late prehistoric Subarctic archaeological sites to demonstrate the enduring relationship between humans, their environment, and the material traces of human existence at both local and regional scales. Therefore, the results of this broadly applicable research can promote an understanding of hunter-gatherer behavior at other periods and in other regions where only coarse-grained, regional datasets are available. This concerted research will increase our understanding of human resilience generally and Athabaskan subsistence traditions specifically by comparing the knowledge of the descendant community, archaeological materials, and a wealth of fine-grained environmental data to elucidate human behavior in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During times of global glacier recession, glaciers in different parts of the world behaved differently. The rate of glacier retreat varied through time, and in some cases, glacier retreat was interrupted by short intervals of glacier growth.  These differential spatial patterns can help scientists predict future patterns of regional response to global environmental variability.  In this project, using various earth science techniques, investigators will analyze glacial landforms in Alaska to affirm regional differences in rates of past glacier change.  Alaska is a region where past glacier change is less well understood than other parts of the world, but one where regional glacier change was different from global patterns.  Findings will contribute to an improved understanding of past regional environmental variability and thereby be an important data source for future modelling.  The project's broader impacts include the career advancement of a scientist from an underrepresented group and includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students. Dissemination will include academic publications and public-oriented materials disseminated via national parks and native communities in Alaska. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better understand the trajectory of future glacier change, and related environmental variability, better regional influences on glacier behavior across the planet must be elucidated. For this reason, detailed knowledge of regional glacier change and their deviations from the global pattern are critically needed for paleoclimate and glacial-geomorphology communities. Carbon dioxide changes during the last deglaciation were tightly coupled to mountain glacier change. Yet, this compilation lacked data from the high latitudes.  Recent research hypothesizes that carbon dioxide in modern times has overwhelmed regional drivers and has become the dominant control on glacier change. The proposed research aims address these ideas by filling in a key data gap.  The investigators will test two hypotheses that are at the forefront of paleoclimate and glacier science. (1) Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary forcing mechanism of mountain glacier change.  (2) Glaciers outside the North Atlantic region advanced during Heinrich stadials, but retreated prior to their terminations. The researchers will reconstruct a highly detailed mountain glacier record from the high northern latitudes, temporally spanning from the last deglaciation to the present. Because continental ice sheets covered most of the high northern latitudes during Ice Ages, there are few accessible sites that offer detailed glacier moraine sequences with materials that can be precisely dated.  Because Alaska remained largely untouched by continental sheets during the last glacial period and was instead dominated by mountain glaciers, this is an ideal location to benchmark and develop a record of glacier change since last deglaciation.  The PIs will combine cosmogenic Beryllium-10 dating of an exceptional moraine sequence in the Revelation Mountains in western Alaska with digital mapping and glacier equilibrium-line altitude analysis to test their hypotheses and to benchmark a regional record of mountain glacier change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, it will depict the job search process for tribal fathers with criminal records as they look for work post-incarceration.  It will describe how these men provide for themselves and their families in the absence of formal employment and how living on vs. off-reservation can shape these processes.  Findings from this study will be of use to policy makers, criminal justice officials, employers, and tribal governments who endeavor to support these men as they seek formal employment and attempt to reintegrate back into society.  They will also be of use for the design of policy to ameliorate the effects of concentrated disadvantage in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this study, 30 tribal respondents from the Yurok and Hoopa Valley reservations, 15 living on reservation and 15 off reservation, will be interviewed. The research will address the question of how tribal fathers with criminal records manage the process of finding work.  Those men who look for work post-incarceration face the double disadvantage of discrimination in the hiring process and a slack local labor market.  They may also have access to resources unique to reservation residence that further weaken labor force attachment.  In collaboration with the Yurok Tribal Court, this project will provide an account of the job search strategies of tribal fathers with criminal records, how they provide for themselves and their families in the absence of formal employment, and how living on vs. living off-reservation can shape these processes. The research questions pursued and the findings uncovered in this novel investigation will provide direction for the study of unemployment on reservations across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How do state actors discuss, arrive at, and justify such authorization of extralegal violence against targeted citizens? The United Kingdom wrestled with this balance between national security and democratic protections during the period of its ""Troubles"" with Northern Ireland. During this time, the U.K. government interned 1,874 un-convicted Irish Catholic citizens and subjected as many as fourteen to the ""five techniques"" of torture. This research leverages an original archival resource -- 8,430 recently-declassified pages from the British Prime Minister's security-related correspondence files (1969-74) -- to analyze the processes by which the United Kingdom internally justified its extralegal internment and torture policies. It identifies the government's internal decision-making processes, compares these internal motivations to the external justifications it publicly presented to support these violent policies, and seeks to identify themes and patterns which may apply to other cases of states? deliberations about using extralegal violence during times of perceived national insecurity. This analysis advances conflict studies and socio-legal scholarship by 1) providing a nuanced understanding of how robust democracies erode rule-of-law protections; 2) identifying the internal-external dimensions of democratic states? authorization of violence; and 3) contributing historical knowledge of the U.K. ""Troubles."" This project increases public-facing scholarship on the complexities of protecting both democracies' national security interests and their rule-of-law principles. Its focus on using detention and torture to quell terrorist threats are particularly relevant to contemporary political debates the world over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines deductive and inductive qualitative social science methods with computational science techniques to identify, analyze, and generalize state justifications for violence, as follows. First, it uses scientific process-tracing methods to identify a series of hypothesized internal motivations and justifications that lead state agents to authorize violence against Irish Catholic citizens. Second, it collects and selectively analyzes additional data on the U.K. Government's public statements. This allows for the identification of (in)consistencies between the government's internal and external justifications for violence. Third, it uses novel natural language processing (NLP) computational science techniques to: build models that detect justifications' text patterns, cross-validate qualitative conclusions, generalize justifications to other cases of state authorizations of violence, and evaluate the efficacy of NLP for this type of research. This research lays the groundwork for future text-as-data machine-learning analysis of government documents. It also applies and advances the frontiers of NLP by examining whether and how these techniques can be tailored to identify recent or unfolding threats to democratic principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project studies how Pay for Success (PFS), a public-private model for social programs, shapes state spending on specific populations in the United States. Under a PFS contract, private investors provide initial funding for a public program, which the government repays only if the program proves successful. The PFS model promises to meet citizen needs while minimizing costs, but it is not yet clear who benefits from these programs, who is left out, and how these decisions are made. This project aims to determine (1) whether the goals of PFS projects influence which populations ultimately benefit from these projects and (2) the consequences of the PFS model for the scope of social provision more broadly. Findings from this study will be useful to policymakers and public advocates as the implementation or modification of PFS programs is considered, and so will contribute to the general public well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis employs a comparative case study design to assess the effect of PFS structure on beneficiary populations across three social service domains. Data collection will be via interviews with public and private actors involved in the design and implementation of PFS programs. Two sets of comparisons will be made: (1) comparisons between PFS proposals that matriculate into social programs and PFS proposals that fail to launch; and (2) comparisons between PFS-structured social programs and traditional social programs within specific issue areas. The case comparisons will illustrate the relationship between the PFS models' cost-savings structure and the populations the model ultimately serves. They will also elucidate the ways in which the PFS model differs from traditional models of service provision in terms of cost and scope. In evaluating these outcomes, this project will contribute to research on public policy and public-private models of social service provision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying this process illuminates how a cognitive system as complicated as language can develop in the human mind, and helps clarify the nature of learning in development. Learning in general requires building on prior knowledge: children can't learn arithmetic if they don't know how to count. This project asks how infants build on their prior linguistic knowledge at each stage of their development, using the limited amount of speech they are able to understand, in order to learn more about the structure of their language. By improving our understanding of how infants learn about their language at each stage in development, the project provides an important step toward understanding why and how the quantity and type of speech heard in infancy contribute to differences in children's later vocabulary and language performance, in school and later in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the acquisition of ""non-basic"" clauses as a window into the incremental nature of language learning. Sentences like ""What did Mary fix?"" are potentially misleading for children in the earliest stages of syntax acquisition, who might not recognize that ""what"" stands for the object of ""fix"" and might think that this clause is intransitive. This work pursues the hypothesis that children may use knowledge about verb argument structure in order to identify non-basic clause types in their language. The research integrates approaches from different research communities, using behavioral experiments to investigate the developmental trajectory of non-basic clause acquisition, and computational modelling to evaluate whether the proposed mechanisms are feasible for learning from child-directed speech. Through this case study, this research aims to provide a fuller picture of what portion of the input is useful to an individual child at any single point in development, how children perceive that input given their current grammatical knowledge, and what internal mechanisms enable them to generalize beyond that input in inferring the grammar of their language. The project also includes outreach about issues in language development to local families and high school students from under-represented backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to basic theory in biogeography, the relative importance of the biological and environmental factors that affect species coexistence, and thus diversity, varies with spatial scale.  The research assesses the relative importance of the controlling factors as well as specific geographies of location within increasing spatial scales and among places that vary in isolation.  This change with scale and isolation is relevant to fundamental understanding of how diversity arises and is maintained, and this research helps guide interpretation of observations of current global change impacts.  For this project, the alpine tundra biome serves as a useful model system because its plant community composition varies across and within mountain ranges and regions.  Project results will be shared with other researchers working on such interpretation in global ecological monitoring programs, such as the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments, as well as with the general public through outreach via the National Park Service's Crown of the Continent Learning Center.  The STEM workforce will be strengthened through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the role of spatial scale in plant community biogeography.  The investigator will assess the variation in plant community composition in alpine tundra in relation to three factors: local habitat (such as soils and topography), climate (biologically relevant seasonal variables), and geographic distance (a proxy for past dispersal).  Which of the three factors, with multiple variables for each, is most important to the patterns of diversity among plots within distances ranging from 100 meters to greater than 1000 kilometers, will be determined statistically.  The pattern of changes in their relative importance along a gradient of increasing distances will be analyzed.  Specifics of isolation will be evaluated through the inclusion of discontinuous ranges.  These analyses test the fundamental theory that the drivers change in a regular pattern as scale is increased.  The project increases knowledge of the importance of spatial interpretation in biogeographic theory and its applications.  The alpine tundra found in an arc across southern-to-eastern Europe, from Spain to Romania, will be studied because the species composition and environment has been recorded for thousands of plots with the same methodology.

Ocean thermal expansion (due to increasing ocean temperatures) and mountain glacier ice loss (due to increased glacier melt rates) have contributed most to global mean sea level rise (SLR) and are expected to continue to dominate SLR over at least the coming century. Unfortunately, the uncertainties in recent glacier contributions to SLR and current volume of glacier ice remain high due, in part, to limited data on glacier volume changes. The improved estimates of historical glacier changes and current glacier volume from this project will provide a critical step towards assessing changes in SLR, quantifying glacier sensitivity to environmental variability, and providing accurate projections of future SLR and its associated societal impacts.  This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will also develop educational lab kits for K-12 classrooms. These kits will communicate the results of this research to school teachers and students, while simultaneously providing hands-on, real world, geographical and spatial science exercises.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will quantify regional glacier volume/mass changes over the past approximately 150 years to significantly improve the spatial and temporal estimates of glacier changes and the associated contributions to SLR.  Investigators will include all mountain glaciers and ice caps across the globe in their analysis.  The investigators will also quantify the current spatial distribution of volume of glacier ice using observations from the initial phase of the research to constrain a glacier model.  This will be accomplished using a combination of techniques (automated cloud characterization schemes, NDSI, photogrammetry, photoclinometry) applied to a suite of remotely sensed data and historical imagery to map glacier area and volume changes over the past several decades.  The investigators will use this information to constrain spatially-varying scale factors for a glacier volume-area scaling model. This work will extend back in time to the Little Ice Age (LIA) by compiling reliable moraine dates and maps, and automated mapping of LIA moraines.  The volume of ice around the end of the LIA will be calculated, which will permit placing the spatial and temporal patterns in glacier volume change into context relevant to assess anthropogenic changes. These new glacier volume and volume change estimates will be used to estimate regional patterns of past and future contributions of glaciers to SLR and identify specific regions where glacier changes and contributions to future SLR are likely to be significant. Thus, this research project will focus on glacier contribution to SLR globally and will provide new insights estimating the impacts of SLR in many countries, including the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Largely absent from this research, however, is an understanding of reservation materiality, that is, how federal policies and Native activities were made manifest in reservation homes, tools, foods, and other objects associated with daily life. Archaeology is well-suited to fill this gap. Unlike written and ethnographic sources, which on reservations were composed primarily by non-Native outsiders with clear political agendas, the archaeological record preserves evidence of Native practices in multiple settings, including those that existed out of sight of federal officials. This project combines archaeological and archival research to document the experiences of Native communities living on the Grand Ronde Reservation in northwestern Oregon. Conducted as part of two community-based research initiatives, this project will provide archaeological field and laboratory training to undergraduate and graduate students. It will also extend opportunities to Grand Ronde tribal members to participate in all aspects of the research, accomplishing the dual goals of increasing the participation of Native people in archaeology and enhancing the capacity of the community to identify and protect tribal heritage. Results will be made available through university data repositories and public presentations at local museums, academic conferences, and Grand Ronde events. Situated at the intersections of archaeology, history, and Native American studies, this work will lend new insight into American colonialism, Native American history, and the value of community-based research in the social sciences. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In collaboration with the Grand Ronde Historic Preservation Office, the project's Principal Investigators will examine the interplay between federal policies aimed at terminating Native lifeways and Grand Ronde survivance, a process of preserving, adapting, and creating cultural traditions. The project focuses on a reservation habitation area used by tribal members from the 1850s through at least the 1920s. Cartographic evidence suggests that this site was part of a larger settlement strategy through which the Grand Ronde community reiterated historic relationships between different Native groups. Archaeological survey and excavation will be used to assess whether similar attempts to maintain pre-reservation practices influenced interior house organization, especially the construction of hearth boxes and sub-floor storage areas, and diet composition. Comparing recovered artifacts to pre-reservation archaeological sites and archival material will reveal the strategies employed by the Grand Ronde community to remake a foreign and often hostile landscape into a culturally familiar home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The distribution of specialized dependent forms and the manner in which they agree with their antecedents vary considerably across languages, but seem to be variants of certain general patterns of locality and sensitivity to syntactic structure that provides clues about the nature of human cognition. The Afranaph Project supports the documentation of minority languages, some of them endangered, thereby contributing to the development of language professionals with stakes in the future of those languages.

This proposed research will use field experiments to study the long-term effects of a one-time unconditional cash transfers to low income families on several outcomes, including health, income and wealth.  This research will answer two questions: what are the long-term effects of one-time income transfers on recipients? Do the effects depend on whether the transfer is unconditional or conditioned on the recipients behaving in certain ways?  The researchers will compare outcomes of families that received unconditional transfers to those of households that did not receive transfers as well as those who received the same amount of transfers but with conditions attached.  The results of this research project will help improve the US government's transfer program and in the process, reduce poverty.  The research results will also be used as inputs into formulating and implementing US aid policies.  Finally, the results of this research will establish the US as the global leader on reducing poverty through one-time income transfers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Governments around the world engage in redistribution of wealth and income in response to economic fluctuations and poverty.

This project will provide a first-of-its-kind analysis of the long-term effects of a large-scale infusion of wealth on outcomes on recipients.  The project builds on a large-scale experiment conducted by an NGO, GiveDirectly (GD), which makes unconditional transfers to poor households. Starting in 2014, GD randomized among a sample of 653 villages to receive these transfers and ""treated"" 11,000 households to receive $1,000.00 each in the selected villages. An initial end line survey was conducted in 2016-2017, with the median survey conducted 10 months after transfers were delivered.

It will also contribute to understanding from a worldwide perspective of how traditional communities are integrated into broader international networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will survey landscapes across the western and eastern landscapes of north-central Zanzibar (Unguja) Island, Tanzania. The western part of Zanzibar is an ideal place for elucidating the courses of settlement in relation to the development of plantation economies, since these regions lie within the most fertile agricultural parts of the island. The eastern regions play an important role for comparative survey data, since they are rockier, less suitable for agriculture, and were possibly an area of refuge for people dispossessed from the prime plantation land. Judgmental surveys starting from above-ground 19th-century plantation sites will be used to inform probabilistic shovel test-pit surveys across the larger region. This evidence will be used to chart long-term Swahili settlement in the rural countryside from AD 1500-1850, and to elucidate how settlement related to social and ecological histories at different scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Deven,,Carlson,decarlson@ou.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,09/01/2018,05/31/2022,455640.00,"This project addresses how organizations use a push and pull process to influence the provision and use of research in education policy in the United States. The pull effects of organizations shape the prevalence and types of research available across policy issues. Organizations tasked with problem solving in education vary in their propensity to solicit research for use in the policy-making process. Organizations also exhibit push effects on the use of research evidence, taking in the supply, and pushing this into resultant regulatory policies. Together, bureaucracies and interest groups synthesize research evidence and use it to shape resulting regulatory policies. In doing so, organizations filter the research used in crafting public policies. The project will enhance the basic understanding of how groups make arguments aimed at influencing public policy, and which groups are more likely to use research to bolster their arguments. The project will provide interest group and education issue profiles for the use of research in developing regulatory proposals in education. The study will generate insights that can subsequently inform strategies used by organizations and citizens hoping to shape regulatory policy decisions in education and other issues. The project will contribute significantly to student training in the process of social research at both the graduate and undergraduate levels by developing skills in working with data, analysis, presentation, and communication of research. The project is therefore in line with larger initiatives across university campuses to engage in skills development. Finally, the project will generate insights for interest groups, policymakers, and citizens hoping to influence education policy, and general lessons for impacting regulatory reform proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages theoretical debates addressing how organizations channel attention to various issues, with a particular focus on how they use research evidence to channel that attention. Regulatory policy-making in education represents a flash-point for the importance of organizations, particularly given their conspicuous absence in two major strands of literature that converge in education regulations. The first is the study of the rule-making process. This literature largely focuses on the role of interest groups in shaping regulatory agendas, ignoring how bureaucracies, like USED, shape both regulatory agendas and the agendas of other actors. The second strand of literature is in education policy, where attention is disproportionately focused on legislation and educational outcomes, all but ignoring regulatory reform as a significant source of policy change. This project focuses on the institutionalized, structured, and transparent process of federal rule-making at USED. This process is unique from nearly all other modes of federal policy-making in that there is a policy proposal, followed by the opportunity for public commenting, then followed by the issuance of a revised regulatory policy. This process allows us to assess the extent to which organizations within USED shape the supply of research evidence from other actors, and in turn, examine how they incorporate research evidence into resultant regulatory policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Common explanations blame economic conditions, suggesting that Americans are facing increasing stress due to bleak economic prospects, leading to destructive health behaviors and poor mental and physical health. This project will examine how characteristics of precarious employment contribute to multiple dimensions of health, including alcohol consumption, prescription drug use, and depressive symptoms in midlife adults. The project will study whether these associations vary by gender and household socioeconomic status, and whether they vary by state-level social policies.  For example, the project hypothesizes that state-level social policies related to financial assistance (e.g., state Earned Income Tax Credit) and health (e.g., expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act) shape how precarious employment affects health outcomes. The project will provide input to social polices suggesting actions for states to take to improve the health of citizens, as well as intervention points for organizations and agencies addressing problematic health patterns in the population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies both the short- and long-term health consequences of precarious employment among midlife workers. The project will analyze the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing, nationally representative sample of adults over age 50 in the United States. The HRS has been administered every two years since 1992 (12 waves) and oversamples African-American and Hispanic households. The analytical sample will include respondents who are currently employed at each wave (approximately age 50 to 65) across four birth cohorts. The project will pay particular attention to the youngest cohort (age 50-55 in 2010), given recent attention to the morbidity and mortality of these midlife adults. Longitudinal models using fixed effects regression and growth mixture modeling will allow assessments of the relationship between precarious work and mental and physical health outcomes by state-level and household-level characteristics.   The project will inform theories involving social stress, precarious work, and population health, and will provide policy guidance at the organizational, state, and national levels regarding ways to promote better health for this population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Sonia,N,Das,sd99@nyu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,07/15/2018,06/30/2023,226245.00,"The research supported by this award will investigate ""linguistic triggers"" in multi-cultural contexts. Research on verbal and non-verbal interactions has shown that even when people speak the same language, they may have different linguistic practices and preconceptions that can inadvertently inhibit mutual understanding. Where ethnic, racial, and linguistic diversity is greatest, so is the potential for incorrect assumptions, misunderstandings, and misjudgments. This research will address this issue through the examination of a data set of over 400 recordings of such interactions to better understand what transpires: when do the interactions produce conflict, when do they not, and why? Findings from the research will support the development of social and legal policies and procedures to help prevent conflict and ensure public welfare and safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by linguistic anthropologist, Dr. Sonia N. Das of New York University and Dr. Sherina Feliciano-Santos of the University of South Carolinsa at Columbia. In 2015, South Carolina became the first state to pass a law requiring police officers to wear body cameras. The researchers will analyze a subset of the first three years of these body-cam and dash-cam video recordings, faces blurred to protect privacy, to document communication patterns between law enforcement officials and subjects during Driving Under the Influence (DUI) stops. The researchers and their team will transcribe and code the video archive, with attention biographical, demographic, and contextual as well as linguistic factors. Recordings will be linked to their written case files to associate them with legal outcomes. This technical analysis will be supplemented with interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in South Carolina to further contextualize underlying assumptions about rights, language, and the interpretation of intent. The research will model the use of qualitative research methods for the joint analysis of ethnographic and corpus data. By asking how situational interpretations of subjects' and police officers' standard communicative practices may play a subtle yet crucial role in impacting rates of occurrences of force by or against police, he research will also provide data to assist in the development and implementation of law enforcement training and multicultural education to prevent the unnecessary escalation of force and the unintentional reproduction of biases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Naim,,Kapucu,kapucu@ucf.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,03/15/2018,08/31/2019,14999.00,"Responding to large disasters and catastrophes is an extremely difficult endeavor. This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Daoqin,,Tong,Daoqin.Tong@asu.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences,08/14/2017,04/30/2019,32795.00,"This research project will examine spatial scale-induced uncertainties and address issues involved in assembling multi-source, multi-scale data in a spatial analysis.  Many spatial studies are compromised due to a discrepancy between the spatial scale at which data are analyzed and the spatial scale at which the phenomenon under investigation operates.  One consequence has been that research findings often conflict when analyses are conducted at differing scales.  Decision making and policy formulation therefore may be misguided by conflicting, biased research findings brought about by spatial scale.  Lacking appropriate ways to deal with this spatial problem has made many existing findings less compelling or even invalid.  In the era of big data with the advancement of spatial data collection technologies, data that were once difficult or impossible to obtain are now widely available at various spatial scales and are being used to study a variety of problems.  Questions regarding spatial data thus become more pressing.  The strategies to be developed for addressing the spatial scale issues have the potential to be applied to many fields and applications.  The research results will benefit researchers and practitioners in processing, analyzing, and presenting multi-source, multi-scale spatial data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous studies have been conducted to understand how issues related to scale influence analyses and interpretation. Despite the efforts, this remains a widely recognized, complex problem with few generalizable solutions.  Even when studies are conducted at the appropriate spatial scale, uncertainty may exist because data are usually collected at different scales and therefore must be aggregated or interpolated to achieve the study scale.  Using a large public health surveillance dataset, the investigators will develop a measurement error-based statistical framework to quantify the space scale-induced uncertainties and provide strategies to ameliorate the issues.  The research will address issues of 1) characterization of scale due to spatial scale definition and data misalignment in the measurement error framework; 2) quantification of the effects of scale issues on the estimation significance and parameter biasedness; and 3) strategies that may be used to reduce uncertainties in a multi-scale analysis."
James,A,Evans,jevans@uchicago.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities,07/01/2018,06/30/2022,531339.00,"Scientific peer review is a central process when deciding who gets published, promoted, or awarded a prize or grant. Consequently, it may have tremendous impact on the career of scientists and the direction of science. Several researchers, however, have shown that scientific peer review can be slow and low-quality. Moreover, some studies have quantified peer review biases - e.g., prejudices against certain ideas - and inconsistencies - e.g., the same work receiving widely different opinions from different groups of peers. These problems delay or sometimes truncate the dissemination of important research, affecting technological development and ultimately the economy. This project analyzes factors that affect the outcomes of peer review, uses these to improve reviewer selection, develops software that optimizes reviewer assignments, and evaluates the resulting models in the real-world context of a scientific journal, major scientific conferences, and massive open, online courses (MOOCs). By the end of this project, the scientific community will have a better understanding of the factors that affect peer review and actionable insights to make peer review better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first component of this project quantifies problems in bias, variance, timing, and quality of reviews. This includes direct effects (e.g., do they collaborate or cite one another) and indirect effects (e.g., do they contribute to and hopefully self-identify with the same community). The project also identifies bias as a function of personal characteristics of author and reviewer. These aspects include age, gender, and minority status, and their visibility and centrality within the field. The same general approach is used to predict the timing of reviews, including the choice to accept the review task. Lastly, the research uses this feature set to predict the quality of reviews. The result, for a given manuscript, includes prediction for each possible reviewer's biases and decision variance, likelihood and timing to participate in the review process, and ultimate review quality. The second component of this project researches and develops techniques to estimate the characteristics of potential reviewers and uses those inferred characteristics to propose, for any given manuscript, a review panel. The techniques optimize the expected value for a cost function that balances the three objectives of reviewer choice variance (bias and covariance), review timing, and review quality.  Presumably, this involves suggesting panels comprised of reviewers with complementary expertise and potentially career stage, who understand the topic and are interested in the manuscripts contents. The project allows the option of making these recommendations conditional on the background, characteristics and position of the editor under consideration. Lastly, the project tests the techniques that automatically assign reviewers and analyzes the output of the process in real world applications. In particular, the project collaborates with a large journal, scientific conferences, and massive open, online course (MOOC) organizations. Through random assignments (current methods versus the project's algorithm), the project evaluates the degree to which the assignment approach produces less reviewer choice variance, faster reviews, and reviews of higher quality. The project creates software and results that can be used by other venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Sonya,,Pritzker,sepritzker@ua.edu,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie",Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci,07/15/2018,06/30/2022,315859.00,"Personal relationships are often a source of comfort and support, but they can also be a source of stress and conflict. Previous laboratory and self-report research indicates that communication between partners is predictive of relational satisfaction and well-being. It also demonstrates that relational behaviors are linked to physical responses in the body that impact both short- and long-term health, and suggests that everyday emotion-laden communication between intimate partners influences physical outcomes and that, in turn, physical responses concurrently influence communication. We only have limited understanding, however, of what this relationship between communication, emotion, and the body looks like on a day-to-day basis, and on how this process differs in relation to racial, socioeconomic, and other cultural pressures influencing different couples. Therefore, understanding the multi-directional processes through which culture, communication, and physiological regulation co-emerge, outside of the laboratory and in specific emotion-laden interactions between intimate partners at home, can lead to more developed scientific understanding about how interpersonal behavior and physical wellbeing are connected. Findings from this research will provide insight into how communication between partners functions as a mediator of both intermediate and long-term effects on wellbeing. Ultimately, this research has implications for individual, relational, and societal health and wellbeing. At the University of Alabama, the project also contributes to the development of a new interdisciplinary program, and the training of both graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Sonya Pritzker, Jason DeCaro, and Joshua Pederson of the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa will develop innovative theoretical and methodological models for understanding how the human body affects and is affected by everyday communication in the context of culture. The purpose of this research is to provide evidence for the ways that regular co-constructed patterns of emotion communication relate to physiological outcomes, ultimately affecting psychosocial wellbeing among couples in everyday life. The research thus takes an ethnographic approach to the study of relating among adult partners in the Southeastern U.S., emphasizing naturalistic observation, video-recoding, in-depth interviews, and close monitoring of physiological activity over multiple days. The researchers aim to collect anthropologically sound evidence for the reciprocal ways moment-to-moment physiology is affected by and affects emotion communication in everyday life, and how this process impacts indicators of psychosocial wellbeing among partners. The overarching intellectual merit of this research is the development of theoretical frameworks and methodological tools for innovative research programs examining intersections between language, culture, and the human body in multiple settings. This project thus brings together disparate subfields of anthropology and related disciplines, contributes to psychological understandings about the dynamics of emotions, and provides unprecedented insight into the ways in which everyday communication among intimate partners is linked to physiological processes. Building on the findings from laboratory studies, this project further addresses the complex layers of culture and communication in relationships within everyday lived experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
